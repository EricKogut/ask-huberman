1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,600
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,680
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,560
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,400
and I'm a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,600
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,800
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,280
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,800
It is however, part of my desire

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,360
and effort to bring you zero
cost to consumer information

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,520
about science and science related tools,

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
along those lines I'd like to thank

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,160
the sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,560
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,880
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
mineral probiotic drink.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,240
and so I'm delighted that
they're a sponsor of the podcast.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens is

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,480
because I found it rather dizzying

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,800
to know which vitamins
and minerals to take

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
and Athletic Greens covers all my bases

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,240
for vitamins and minerals.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,800
It also includes probiotics
and there are now a lot

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
of data supporting the fact
that probiotics are important

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
for the gut brain access, for immunity

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,560
for metabolic health, endocrine
health, many, many things.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,320
So I take Athletic Greens once,

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,440
sometimes twice a day

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,000
I mix it with water and a
little bit of lemon juice

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,160
and to me it tastes delicious.

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,760
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
and if you do that they'll also give

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,760
you a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,120
There are a lot of data now showing

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,480
that vitamin D3 is important

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,080
for immune function and a number

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,160
of other important biological processes.

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,800
In addition, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman

41
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,880
you'll get five free travel packs,

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
travel packs make it easy to mix up

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
Athletic Greens when you're in the car,

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
on the plane or generally on the road.

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
So that's Athletic Greens.com
to get Athletic Greens.

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
The year supply of vitamin D3 and K2

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
and the five free travel packs.

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,840
Our second sponsor of
today's podcast is Headspace.

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,720
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
I've been meditating on and
off since I was 16 years old.

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm 45 now.

52
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,560
So that's about 30 years
of on and off meditation

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,520
and I confess most of
that time it was off,

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
meaning I find it really hard to stick

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
to a meditation practice.

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,960
A few years ago I discovered Headspace

57
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,240
while flying on JetBlue flights

58
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,720
'cause at that time they
were offering Headspace

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,440
as something you could watch
instead of TV or movies.

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,960
And it made me feel great.

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,400
I'd find that I arrived

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
where I was going, more
rested, more relaxed

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
and I got the Headspace app
and I started using it daily

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
and I've continued to use it daily.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
Headspace has a large
number of meditations

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
all supported by science.

67
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,280
There's also now just a
tremendous amount of science

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
supporting a meditation practice

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,320
for all sorts of things
like improved sleep,

70
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,440
reduced impulsivity, improved cognition.

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,160
There are just a myriad of
positive effects of meditation.

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,280
The hardest thing is doing it

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
and Headspace makes that easy.

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,960
If you wanna try the Headspace app

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,440
and all the meditations
they have, you can go

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,480
to headspace.com/special
offer, and you'll get

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
one month completely free
of all the meditations

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,800
they have that's
headspace.com/special offer to

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,960
get one month free of Headspace.

80
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,840
The third sponsor of today's
podcast is magic spoon.

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,520
Magic spoon is a low carb,

82
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
grain-free keto friendly cereal.

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
As I've mentioned a few
times before on this podcast

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
the way I eat throughout
the day has everything to do

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
with when I wanna be alert
and when I wanna be sleepy.

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
So in the first part of the day

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,160
I fast because that enhances alertness.

88
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,280
Then I eat keto.

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
So my lunch and my afternoon
meals are ketogenic

90
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,160
and then in the evening I eat starches

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,120
and vegetables because those
aid the transition to sleep.

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,800
So for me, magic spoon as a
keto cereal is a great snack.

93
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,920
It's really tasty.

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
I don't actually mix mine with milk.

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
I just eat it directly.

96
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,080
They have a bunch of different flavors.

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,320
I like the frosted flavor also

98
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
because it tastes like donuts.

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
And I have a pastry affliction
and I love pastries.

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
So magic spoon allows me to remain

101
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
on keto during the day it's healthy.

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,080
It tastes great.

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
I really enjoy it.

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
So if you wanna try magic spoon

105
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,520
for a variety pack of different flavors.

107
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,360
And if you put Huberman at checkout

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
you'll get 5 dollars off the variety pack.

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
That's magicspoon.com/huberman
to try a variety pack

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
of different flavors of magic spoon keto

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,800
grain-free low carb cereal

112
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,280
put "Huberman" at checkout
you get 5 dollars off.

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
A quick note before we
begin today's discussion

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,400
about the neuroscience of motivation.

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm pleased to announce

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
that we have now captioned episodes one

117
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
and two in Spanish and
soon, all the episodes

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
of the Huberman Lab
Podcast will be captioned

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
on YouTube in Spanish.

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
We've used some of the revenue

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
from the podcast to
hire expert captioners.

122
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
So it should be accurate.

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
You might catch a mistake here

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
or there a dialect
difference from time to time

125
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
but by our read and by our experts reads,

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
it's all accurate.

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,080
So we're very pleased that
people who speak Spanish

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
and digest information
best in Spanish can now

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
digest the information
here on the podcast.

130
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,440
Thanks to everyone for
supporting the podcast

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,160
which allows us to broaden
our reach in these ways

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
and we do hope to expand

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,640
to other languages in
the very near future.

134
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
This month, we're talking all

135
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,920
about the neuroscience of emotions

136
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,240
and today we're going to
talk about an extremely

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,360
important topic that
central to our daily life

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
and that's motivation.

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
We're going to talk about
pleasure and reward.

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,080
What underlies our sense
of pleasure or reward.

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
We're going to talk about addictions.

142
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
You can't have a discussion about pleasure

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,360
and reward without having a
discussion about addictions

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
and the addictive properties
of certain substances

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
as well as how to break free of addiction.

146
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,480
As well we're going to talk

147
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,560
about the neurochemistry
of drive and mindset.

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,480
So all these themes are woven together

149
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
in the context of emotions.

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
Each one of them of course could also

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,920
be its own entire month of the podcast

152
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
and in fact, we are going to have

153
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,160
an entire month devoted to addiction

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,440
and I have a very special guest

155
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
that's going to be joining us

156
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
to talk about the science

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
and clinical practices
that we know are important

158
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
for understanding and treating addiction.

159
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
But for now, let's just
talk about the neuroscience

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
of motivation and reward
of pleasure and pain

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,200
because those are central to
what we think of as emotions

162
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,240
whether or not we feel good,

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,080
whether or not we feel
we're on track in life

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,920
whether or not we feel
we're falling behind.

165
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,560
So motivation is fundamental
to our daily life.

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
It's what allows us to get
out of bed in the morning.

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,200
It's what allows us to
pursue long-term goals

168
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,240
or short-term goals,

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,320
motivation and the chemistry of motivation

170
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,440
is tightly wound in with the
neurochemistry of movement.

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,040
In fact, the same single
molecule ,dopamine

172
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,600
is responsible for our sense of motivation

173
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,440
and for movement, even though
nerves controlling muscles.

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
So again, these are
nerves in the spinal cord

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
or brain that move our
limbs, the effector chemical

176
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
they're the one that actually
causes the muscles to

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
twitch to contract, is a
CDOT Colleen in the brain.

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,640
Acetylcholine is responsible for focus.

179
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,960
However, whether or not we move,

180
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
whether or not we want to move

181
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,520
whether or not we have the
desire to overcome barriers of

182
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
they could be social barriers

183
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
or financial barriers or time constraints.

184
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,040
That depends on this molecule.

185
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,920
We call dopamine, it's
a fascinating molecule

186
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,520
and it lies at the center of
so many great things in life

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
and it lies at the center

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
of so many terrible aspects of life

189
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
namely addiction and certain
forms of mental disease.

190
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,680
So if ever there was a double-edged blade

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
in the world of
neuroscience it's dopamine.

192
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
So let's talk about what dopamine is

193
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
and as always we are going to talk

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
about actionable tools today.

195
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,120
We're definitely gonna talk about

196
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
some things related to supplementation.

197
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,880
Although you might be surprised to learn

198
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,200
that it's not all just
about increasing dopamine

199
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
and in particular, in some cases

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
that's the wrong thing to do.

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,200
Sometimes it's appropriate
sometimes it's not.

202
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,120
More so we're going to
talk about tools related

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
to what's called dopamine scheduling, how

204
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,200
the way that you're leading your life

205
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,440
and the way that you're
conceptualizing your goals

206
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,200
can actually predict whether

207
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,520
or not you're going to
continue to pursue those goals.

208
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,800
And therefore whether

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
or not you will succeed
in achieving those goals

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
As well as whether or not you will quit.

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,320
There's a fundamental relationship between

212
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,240
dopamine released in your brain

213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,480
and your desire to exert effort.

214
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,040
And you can actually control the schedule

215
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,000
of dopamine release

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
but it requires the appropriate knowledge.

217
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,920
This is one of those cases where

218
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,320
understanding the way
the dopamine system works

219
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,559
will allow you to leverage
it to your benefit.

220
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,279
And if you don't understand
the way that dopamine works

221
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,360
there's a good chance that it's going

222
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
to pull you out into the current of life.

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Meaning the rest of the world is going

224
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
to control your dopamine schedules.

225
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,680
So I'm excited to tell you
about today's information.

226
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,960
You're gonna learn some basic science.

227
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
You're gonna learn a lot of tools

228
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
and these tools I believe are applicable

229
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,840
whether or not you're five years old

230
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,960
eight years old, 80 years
older, anything in between.

231
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,640
So let's talk about dopamine.

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,040
Let's get a few basic facts on the table.

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s

234
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,960
and it was discovered as the
precursor, meaning the thing

235
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,640
from which epinephrin
or adrenaline is made.

236
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
Now that's fundamentally important

237
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,760
because this molecule we
call dopamine nowadays,

238
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,960
we think of as the molecule
of reward and pleasure,

239
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,920
but actually it is the substrate

240
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
from which adrenaline
is made and in the brain

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
it's the substrate from
which epinephrin is

242
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,160
made epinephrin is the
same thing as adrenaline

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
except in the brain we call it epinephrin.

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,360
Epinephrin as you may recall
from previous podcasts,

245
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,520
or if you haven't no problem epinephrin

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
allows us to get into action.

247
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,760
It stimulates changes in the
blood vessels, in the heart

248
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,800
in the organs and tissues

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,760
of the body that bias us for movement.

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
And if you'd like to learn
more about epinephrin

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,520
you can check out our
episode on mastering stress.

252
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,800
We talk a lot about it there.

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,520
Dopamine was initially thought to be just

254
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,200
the building block for epinephrin.

255
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,280
And it is indeed the
chemical building block

256
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,520
from which epinephrin is made.

257
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,080
However, dopamine does a
lot of things on its own.

258
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,320
It's not always converted to epinephrin.

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,120
Dopamine is released from several sites

260
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
in the brain and body, but
perhaps the most important one

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
for today's discussion about motivation

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,080
and reward is something
that sometimes just

263
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,160
called the reward pathway

264
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,000
for the it's sometimes called

265
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the mesolimbic reward pathway

266
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
but it's fundamentally important

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
to your desire to engage in action

268
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
and it's fundamentally important

269
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,400
for people getting addicted
to substances or behaviors.

270
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,840
So how does this work?

271
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,200
Well, you've got a structure

272
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
in the deep part of your
brain called the VTA.

273
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
It stands for ventral tegmental area.

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,080
As always you don't have
to remember these names,

275
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,720
but if you want to I
offer them to you for food

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,520
further googling, research,
reading, et cetera,

277
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,440
the VTA or ventral tegmental
area contains neurons that

278
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,480
send what we call axons little
wires that spit out dopamine

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
at a different structure
called the nucleus accumbens

280
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,400
and those two structures VTA
and nucleus accumbens form

281
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,080
really the core machinery
of the reward pathway

282
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,560
and the pathway that
controls your motivation

283
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,080
for anything you can think
of them like an accelerator

284
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,640
they bias you for action.

285
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,240
However, within the reward
pathway, there's also a break

286
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
the break or restriction on that dopamine

287
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,320
which controls when it's released

288
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,440
and how much it's released
is the prefrontal cortex.

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
The prefrontal cortex is
the neural real estate right

290
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
behind your forehead.

291
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
It's discussed for so many
aspects of neuroscience.

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
You hear about it for decision-making ,

293
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
executive function ,for
planning, et cetera.

294
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
And indeed it's responsible
for a lot of those.

295
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
It's this really unique real estate

296
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
that we were all endowed with as humans,

297
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
other animals don't have much of it.

298
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,440
We have a lot of it

299
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
and that prefrontal cortex acts

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,280
as a brake on the dopamine system

301
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,160
without that break you would be purely

302
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
a pleasure seeking animal.

303
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,920
You would be purely pleasure seeking.

304
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,240
You would have no basis for
regulating your behavior

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
in terms of trying to get
things that make you feel good.

306
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,920
And that brings us to the
important feature of motivation

307
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,720
which is that motivation
is a two-part process

308
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,840
which is about balancing
pleasure and pain.

309
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Okay. Most people think about motivation

310
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,080
and reward and dopamine is just
trying to achieve pleasure.

311
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,400
And indeed dopamine is released

312
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,040
in the brain from the VTA
at the* nucleus accumbens.

313
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,920
When we experience things that we like.

314
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
So here's the way to conceptualize this

315
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
and if you can internalize
this in your mind

316
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
it will really help you as
you move through your day

317
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
trying to understand why
you might be motivated

318
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,200
or not motivated for certain things.

319
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
So when you're just sitting
around, not doing much

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,520
of anything, maybe you wake
up in bed in the morning.

321
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,680
You're thinking about getting up or not.

322
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,280
This reward pathway is releasing dopamine

323
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,720
at a rate of about three
or four times per second.

324
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
It's kind of firing in a low level.

325
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,640
When I say firing me an electrical
activity in the neurons.

326
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,840
So when you're just around,
you feel okay, not depressed

327
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,080
not highly motivated, not excited

328
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,000
maybe three or four times a second.

329
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,360
If suddenly you get
excited about something

330
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
you anticipate something,
not receive an award

331
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,440
but you get excited in
an anticipatory way.

332
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,080
Then the rate of firing
the rate of activity

333
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,320
in this reward pathway suddenly increases

334
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
to like 30 or 40 times

335
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
and it has the effect of creating a sense

336
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
of action or desire to move

337
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,600
in the direction of the
thing that you're craving.

338
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,280
In fact, it's fair to say
that dopamine is responsible

339
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
for wanting and for craving,

340
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,040
and that's distinctly different

341
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
from the way that you hear
it talked about normally

342
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
which is that it's involved in pleasure.

343
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
So yes, dopamine is
released in response to sex.

344
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
It's released in response to food.

345
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,240
It's released in response
to a lot of things

346
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,200
but it's mostly released in anticipation

347
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,440
and craving for a particular thing.

348
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
It has the effect of narrowing our focus

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
for the thing that we crave

350
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,160
and that thing could be as
simple as a cup of coffee.

351
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,040
It could be as important
as a big board meeting.

352
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
It could be a big, final exam.

353
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,640
It could be a, the person
that we're excited to meet

354
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,320
or see dopamine doesn't care
about what you're craving.

355
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
It just releases at a particular rate.

356
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
In fact, if we just take a step back

357
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,200
and we look at the scientific data

358
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,760
on how much the dopamine
firing increases in response

359
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,720
to different things, you get
a pretty interesting window

360
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,560
into how your brain works

361
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,200
and why you might be
motivated or not motivated.

362
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,840
Let's say you're hungry,
or you're looking forward

363
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,600
to a cup of coffee, or you're
going to see your partner.

364
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,520
Well, your dopamine neurons
are firing at a low rate

365
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,240
until you start thinking
about the thing that you want

366
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,760
or the thing that you're
looking forward to

367
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
let's say you're craving chocolate

368
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,080
or a good meal, a steak

369
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,720
if you like steak or a nice plate of pasta

370
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
if you like pasta, when you eat that food

371
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,760
the amount of dopamine that's released

372
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,920
in this reward pathway goes
up about 50% above baseline.

373
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,840
The neurons there go from firing,

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,040
three or four times per second to,

375
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,480
six or 10 times per second.

376
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,440
It really depends

377
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
and these aren't exact numbers.

378
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,160
But if we were to measure the amount

379
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
of dopamine that's released, it goes

380
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
up about 50 points, all right.

381
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,440
Sex, which is fundamental

382
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,640
to our species, continuation
and reproduction.

383
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,120
Although it doesn't have to
be for conceiving children.

384
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,920
Sex does release dopamine

385
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,880
and it increases dopamine
levels about a hundred percent.

386
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
So basically doubles them.

387
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes

388
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,520
or some people are taking nicotine

389
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,240
in supplemental form increases the amount

390
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
of dopamine about 150% above baseline.

391
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
It also does some other
things that we're gonna

392
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,480
talk about, but nicotine does that

393
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
and it's kind of interesting

394
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,880
that nicotine would increase the amount

395
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,560
of dopamine in your brain
very quick, within seconds

396
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,160
that's 150 times over
baseline as opposed to sex

397
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,360
which is a 100 percent
above or food which is 50%.

398
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,960
Cocaine and amphetamine
increase the amount

399
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,600
of dopamine that's
released a thousand fold

400
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
within about 10 seconds
of consuming the drug.

401
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
However, just thinking about food,

402
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,560
about sex, about nicotine

403
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,640
if you like nicotine or cocaine

404
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,960
or amphetamine can increase the amount

405
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,320
of dopamine that's released

406
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,080
to the same degree as
actually consuming the drug.

407
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,640
Now it depends in some cases, for instance

408
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,920
the cocaine user, the
addict that wants cocaine

409
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,320
can't just think about
cocaine and increase

410
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
the amount of that's
released about a thousand

411
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,920
fold is actually much lower

412
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,560
but it's just enough to put
them on the motivation track

413
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
for it to crave that particular thing.

414
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,400
Now, there are reasons why you would

415
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,680
have brain circuitry like this.

416
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
I mean, brain circuitry

417
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
like this didn't evolve
to get you addicted

418
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,440
brain circuitry like this evolved

419
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
in order to motivate behaviors

420
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,520
toward particular goals,

421
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
water when you're thirsty ,

422
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,400
sex in order to reproduce

423
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,240
and we're gonna talk
about the relationship

424
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,800
between estrogen and testosterone
and the dopamine system

425
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
because those hormones actually

426
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
bias dopamine to be released.

427
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,680
These things and these
brain areas in neurons

428
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,880
were part of the
evolutionary history that led

429
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
to the continuation of our species.

430
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,400
Things like cocaine and
amphetamine are disastrous

431
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,440
for most people because
they really so much dopamine

432
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,520
and they create these
closed loops where people

433
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,600
then only crave the particular
thing, cocaine, amphetamine

434
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
that leads to those massive
amounts of dopamine release.

435
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
Most things don't release
that level of dopamine.

436
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,800
Now, nowadays there's a ton

437
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,240
of interest in social
media and in video games

438
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
and there have been some measurements

439
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,680
of the amount of dopamine
released video games

440
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,400
especially video games
have a very high update

441
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
speed where there's novel
territory all the time

442
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,600
not novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.

443
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
Those can release dopamine somewhere

444
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,520
between nicotine and cocaine.

445
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
So very high levels of dopamine release.

446
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Social media is an interesting one

447
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,840
because the amount of dopamine

448
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
that's released in response to logging

449
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,560
onto social media initially
could be quite high

450
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,600
but it seems like likely that
there's a taper in the amount

451
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
of dopamine and yet
people still get addicted.

452
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,440
So why, why is it that we can get addicted

453
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
to things that fail to get

454
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,280
to elicit the same massive amount

455
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
of pleasure that they initially did.

456
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,920
Being addicted to
something isn't just about

457
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,360
the fact that it feels so good

458
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
that you wanna do it over and over again

459
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
and that's because of
this pleasure pain balance

460
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,000
that underlies motivation.

461
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
So let's look a little bit closer

462
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
at the pleasure pain balance because

463
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,880
there in lies the tools

464
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
for you to be able to control motivation

465
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
toward healthy things and
avoid motivated behaviors

466
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,000
towards things that are
destructive for you.

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
There are a lot of reasons why

468
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
people try novel behaviors

469
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,480
whether or not those are drugs or

470
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
whether or not those are adventure,

471
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
thrill-seeking things or
they seek out new partners

472
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
they take a new class as you'll notice.

473
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm not placing any judgment

474
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,760
or value on these different behaviors.

475
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
Although I think it's fair to point

476
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,040
out that for most people addictive drugs

477
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,080
like cocaine and amphetamine
are very destructive.

478
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,280
Actually we know that about 15

479
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,280
to 20% of people have a genetic bias

480
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,720
towards addiction , you sometimes hear

481
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,400
that the first time that you use a drug

482
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
you can become addicted to it.

483
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,960
That's actually not been shown
to be true for most things

484
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,520
in most people, but for some
people that actually is true.

485
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
And we'll talk a little
bit later about why

486
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,280
certain people are heavily
biased toward becoming addicts

487
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,840
on the first use of a particular drug.

488
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,960
It's actually very interesting,

489
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,640
it has everything to do with whether

490
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
or not they were formerly
addicted to something else

491
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,640
but in any case, the
way that addiction works

492
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
and the way that
motivation works generally

493
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
in the non-addictive setting is

494
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
that when you anticipate something

495
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,800
a little bit of dopamine
is released, and then

496
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,120
when you reach that thing,
you're engaged in that thing

497
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,560
the amount of dopamine
goes up even further

498
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,360
but as you repeatedly pursue a behavior

499
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
and you repeatedly engage
with a particular thing

500
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
let's say you love running

501
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
or you love chocolate as
you eat a piece of chocolate

502
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,760
believe it or not, it tastes good

503
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,240
and then there's a shift away
from activation of dopamine.

504
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
And there are other
chemicals that are released

505
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,600
that trigger a low level sense of pain.

506
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Now you might not feel it as physical pain

507
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
but the craving that you feel

508
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,160
is both one part dopamine

509
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,800
and one part, the mirror image of dopamine

510
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,080
which is the pain

511
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
or the craving for yet
another piece of chocolate.

512
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,480
And this is a very important

513
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
and subtle feature of the dopamine system.

514
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
That's not often discussed.

515
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
People always talk about just as pleasure.

516
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,120
You love social media.

517
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
So it gives you dopamine.
And so you engage in that.

518
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,280
You like chocolate, it releases dopamine.

519
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,840
So you do that.

520
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
But for every bit of
dopamine that's released

521
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,440
there's another circuit

522
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
in the brain that creates you can think

523
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
of it as kind of like a
downward deflection in pleasure.

524
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
So you engage in something you really want

525
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
and there's an increase in pleasure.

526
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,600
And then without you doing anything

527
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,960
there's a mirror image of that

528
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,040
which is a downward deflection in pleasure

529
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,320
which we're calling pain.

530
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
So for every bit of pleasure

531
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,160
there is a mirror image experience

532
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,040
of pain and they overlap
in time very closely.

533
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,720
So it's sometimes hard to sense this

534
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
but try it the next time you
eat something really delicious.

535
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,920
You'll take a bite,

536
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,200
it tastes delicious

537
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
and part of the experience is
to want more of that thing.

538
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,880
This is true for any
pleasureful experience.

539
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,800
Now, the diabolical part
about dopamine is that

540
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,080
because it didn't evolve in
order to get you to indulge

541
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,760
in more and more and more of
something, what happens is

542
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,280
that initially you experience
an increase in pleasure

543
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,360
and you also experience this increase

544
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,520
in pain shortly after or woven in

545
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,960
with the pleasure that makes
you want more of that thing.

546
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,680
But with each subsequent time

547
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,520
that you encounter that thing

548
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
that you pursue, the chocolate that

549
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,400
you pursue the lover
each time, the experience

550
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,840
of dopamine release and pleasure
is diminished a little bit.

551
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
And the diabolical thing is

552
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
that the pain response
is increased a little bit

553
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
and this is best observed

554
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,160
in the context of drug seeking behavior.

555
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
The first time someone
decides to take cocaine

556
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,280
or amphetamine, they may
do it out of boredom.

557
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,880
They may do it out of peer pressure.

558
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
They may do it to relieve
some internal sense.

559
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,120
Maybe they're bored, or
they're just excited.

560
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
Maybe they're high in
novel novelty seeking.

561
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
There are a lot of reasons why people

562
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
might try a drug far too many for us

563
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,040
to get into our parks here.

564
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,720
Maybe they don't even wanna do it

565
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
but someone encourages them.

566
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,560
They will experience a
huge dopamine release

567
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,800
and they will feel likely very good.

568
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
However, the next time they take it

569
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,800
it won't feel quite as good.

570
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,880
And it won't feel even
as good the third time

571
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,040
or the next time, but the amount of pain

572
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,200
the amount of craving that they experience

573
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
for the drug will increase over time.

574
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
So much of our pursuit of pleasure

575
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,480
is simply to reduce the pain of craving.

576
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,160
So the next time you
experienced something,

577
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,280
you really like I don't wanna

578
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,400
take you out of that experience

579
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
but it's really important
that you notice this

580
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
that if there's something you really enjoy

581
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
part of that enjoyment is

582
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,880
about the anticipation and
wanting of more of that thing

583
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
and that's the pain system in action.

584
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,240
And so we can distinguish between dopamine

585
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,160
which is really about
pleasure and dopamine

586
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,800
which is really about
motivation to pursue more

587
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,720
in order to relieve or
exclude future pain.

588
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,760
Let me repeat that.

589
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
Dopamine isn't as much
about pleasure, as much

590
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
as it is about motivation
and desire to pursue more

591
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,280
in order to reduce the amount of pain

592
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,600
and we are now talking about pain

593
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,520
as a psychological pain and a craving

594
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
although people that
miss a lover very badly

595
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,960
or that really crave a food very badly,

596
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,880
or that are addicted to
a drug and can't access,

597
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,240
it will experience that
as a physical craving

598
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
and a mental craving the body and brain

599
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
are linked in this way.

600
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
It's almost, they'll
describe it as painful.

601
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
They yearn for it.

602
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,520
And I think the word yearning
is one that's very valuable

603
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
in this context, because yearning seems to

604
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,360
include a whole body experience
more than just wanting

605
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
which could just be up in the mind.

606
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
So your desire for
something is proportional

607
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,280
to how pleasureful it is
to indulge in that thing

608
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
but also how much pain you experience when

609
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,480
you don't have it.

610
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
And you can now start
to let your mind wander

611
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,880
into all sorts of examples of addictions

612
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,160
or things that you happen to like,

613
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I'll use the example that
I sometimes use on here

614
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,400
which is my love of croissants.

615
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,680
Although several of you pointed out

616
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,040
these are called croissant

617
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,800
but then it sounds like
I'm trying to speak French

618
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,720
and I always tried to
do that when I was a kid

619
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
and I went to a bilingual
school and it failed

620
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,440
then it's gonna fail now.

621
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,720
So I'm gonna call them croissants.

622
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,480
They're delicious.

623
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I love them a really good
one makes me wanna eat six.

624
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,280
It's true.

625
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,600
I have pretty good
impulse control, I think

626
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,920
but it makes me wanna eat six.

627
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,840
I taste it and it tastes so delicious

628
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,080
and unless I really force
myself to experience

629
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
the taste of it in my mouth

630
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,360
and how flaky I'm getting
hungry for it right now

631
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
and delicious the croissant
is mostly the tastes

632
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,120
of that croissant makes me
want to eat more croissants.

633
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Now, eventually blood sugar goes up

634
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,560
satiety is reached, et cetera.

635
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,440
What happens then?

636
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,760
What is satisfaction and satiety about?

637
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Well, that's a separate neuromodulator.

638
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.

639
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,240
It's about oxytocin.

640
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,800
It's about a hormone system
that involves something

641
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,680
called prolactin.

642
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
So we're gonna talk about

643
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,560
all of those in the book

644
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,400
"the Molecule of More" wonderful book

645
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
those were described as
the here and now molecules

646
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,960
the ones that allow you to
experience your sensations

647
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,320
and pleasure in the present

648
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,520
and for which the brain stops
projecting into the future.

649
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,200
So now let's talk about craving

650
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
and these so-called here and now molecules

651
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,520
and how those engage in a kind

652
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,480
of push pull balance that
will allow you to not

653
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,600
just feel more motivated,
but also to enjoy the things

654
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,800
in life that you are pursuing
to a much greater degree.

655
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,960
We have neurons in an area

656
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,080
of our brain called the raphe R-A-P-H-E

657
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,040
The raphe releases serotonin

658
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,720
at different places in the brain.

659
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
Serotonin is the molecule of bliss

660
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
and contentment for what you already have.

661
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,440
I've talked before about exteroception,

662
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,320
exteroception is a focus
on the outside world,

663
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
everything beyond the
confines of your skin.

664
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,200
I've also talked about
interoception of focus

665
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
on things that are happening internally

666
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,920
within the confines of your skin.

667
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,240
Dopamine and serotonin can be thought

668
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,040
of as related to extra reception.

669
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,440
Dopamine makes us focused
on things outside us

670
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,320
that are beyond what we
call our personal space

671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
where we actually have to move

672
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,800
and take action in order to achieve things

673
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,120
and serotonin in general has to do with

674
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
the things that are in our
immediate here and now,

675
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
hence the description

676
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,920
of these as the here and now molecules.

677
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,400
So it's interesting to
point out that the body

678
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,040
and the brain can direct its attention

679
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,800
towards things outside us or inside us

680
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,320
or split our attention between those.

681
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,920
I talked about this in a previous podcast

682
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,280
but if you didn't see it, no problem.

683
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,480
Just understand that dopamine biases us

684
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,640
toward thinking about what we don't have,

685
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,280
whereas serotonin and some
of the related molecules

686
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,000
like the endocannabinoids
if you picked up on

687
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
the word cannabinoid,
yes it's like cannabis

688
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,680
because cannabis attaches to
endocannabinoids receptors

689
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
and the endocannabinoids
are receptors that

690
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,560
and chemicals that the
cannabinoids that you

691
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,360
naturally make that are involved
in things like forgetting.

692
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
It's not a coincidence

693
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,600
that pot smokers don't have
the most terrific memory.

694
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,360
You may know a few that
have great memories

695
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,000
but chances are, they would
have even better memories

696
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
if they weren't pot smokers

697
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
but you make these molecules that bind

698
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,240
to these receptors that
make you feel kinda blissed

699
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,640
out and content in the present.

700
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Those are receptors that exist in us

701
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,200
not for sake of consuming
THC or marijuana, but

702
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,120
for sake of binding of our
natural endogenous cannabinoids.

703
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,320
So you've got these two systems

704
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
they're kind of like a push pull

705
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,120
and if you were to say in the book

706
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,680
or wherever you go there
you are Jon Kabat-Zinn talks

707
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,360
about this meditation practice.

708
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
That's different than
most meditation practices

709
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,880
where you eat one almond

710
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,680
and you focus all of your
attention on the almond

711
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
the taste of the almond,
the texture of the almond.

712
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,560
That's really a mindfulness practice

713
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,280
that's geared towards
trying to take a behavior

714
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,400
which is normally about
pursuit, normally feeding

715
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,920
as we were going to engage in
feeding because of dopamine

716
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
we pursue more of a food

717
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
because of that pleasure pain relationship

718
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,840
I talked about before the
focus on the one almond

719
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
or becoming very present

720
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,640
in any behavior that
normally would be a kind

721
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,280
of extra susceptive pursuit behavior

722
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,320
and bring it into the here

723
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,920
and now that's a mental
trick or a mental task

724
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,640
that the mindfulness
community has really embraced

725
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,280
in order to try

726
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,400
and create increased pleasure
for what you already have.

727
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,640
It's really trying to accomplish a shift

728
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,600
from dopamine being released to serotonin

729
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,880
in the cannabinoid system,
being involved in that behavior.

730
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,280
So if you're interested in mindfulness

731
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
which is something I've talked
about before in this podcast

732
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,920
and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes

733
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,320
about the opposite of
mindfulness being mindlessness.

734
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,920
Mindfulness is a vast space

735
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
that is a mindful practice that a lot

736
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,880
of people have engaged in.

737
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
And indeed it can give
you deeper appreciation

738
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,280
for things that you already have.

739
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,560
Dopamine has the quality

740
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,760
of making people kind of
rabidly in pursuit of things.

741
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
Look at people who are high

742
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,640
on cocaine or amphetamine,
and they are almost

743
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,960
entirely extra receptive drugs
like marijuana, the opioids

744
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,160
anything that really hits
the serotonin system hard

745
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
tend to make people rather lethargic

746
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
and content to stay
exactly where they are.

747
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,680
They don't wanna pursue much at all.

748
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,240
Occasionally when people
smoke marijuana or consume THC

749
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,520
their appetite goes way up

750
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,200
and they really wanna consume food.

751
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,160
That's because of its effects
on insulin and its effects

752
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,880
on blood sugar, which is a
slightly separate matter.

753
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,120
But since some of you, probably your minds

754
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,080
might've gone to those either experiences

755
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,440
or reports of what pot does,
that's why it does that.

756
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,600
So you've got these molecules

757
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,120
like dopamine that make you focused

758
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,200
on the things you want
and the things you crave.

759
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,440
And then you've got the
molecules that make you content

760
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,240
with what you have.

761
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,680
So the most important thing,
perhaps in creating a healthy

762
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,760
emotional landscape is to have a balance

763
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
between these two neuromodulator systems

764
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,160
people that are always in anticipation

765
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,640
and desire and seeking that's
wonderful for pursuing goals.

766
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,040
However, it's terrible for enjoying life

767
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,560
and actually those
people are actually quite

768
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,600
difficult to be around.

769
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
There's a certain, almost
sociopathic element

770
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,040
to people who are what they
call hyper dopaminergic.

771
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,280
People who are always on
the dopaminergic scale

772
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,200
to the point where they
are always pursuing goals.

773
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,720
In fact, those people are known to be

774
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,520
at least in the psychological spectrum.

775
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,080
They can be very manipulative dopamine

776
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,640
and the pursuit of something
doesn't necessarily

777
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,000
have to be high energy and
intense from the outside.

778
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,520
When you observe it from the outside.

779
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,160
In fact, there are people
who will manipulate

780
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,760
in order to get what they want.

781
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,640
This has been shown who have
high levels of dopamine release

782
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,480
in their brain, but
they've learned that a kind

783
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,520
of passive manipulation is
the best way to maneuver

784
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,280
through a particular environment.

785
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,480
I don't wanna focus too much

786
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,840
on sociopathy because those
are kind of extreme examples

787
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,800
but it just goes to show that
people who identify a goal

788
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,680
and realize the series of
steps that they need to take

789
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,520
in order to achieve that
goal can either do it

790
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,920
through ethical means or non
ethical means they can do it

791
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,440
through active pursuit, being the kind

792
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
of type a person that's
always declaring their goals

793
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and going after it,
posting it on Instagram

794
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,960
telling everybody about
it, try and recruit others.

795
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,160
There's that phenotype

796
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
there's that kind of signature of dopamine

797
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
and then there are the people that wanna

798
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
get what they want, and they're doing it

799
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,240
by always serving other people

800
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
by always taking care of
everybody else's needs

801
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,960
by always trying to accomplish their goals

802
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
but through a mode that at least

803
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
from the outside seems more passive

804
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,600
or more about supporting others.

805
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,520
Neither of these are good or bad.

806
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,760
And that's because dopamine is a molecule.

807
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,320
It doesn't care how you reach your goals.

808
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,400
It only cares that you reach your goals

809
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,960
because the internal sensation
is one again of mild pleasure

810
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,560
a little bit of pain,
although more pain over time.

811
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,400
If you're not reaching those goals

812
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,600
and it takes you away
from the here and now.

813
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,080
So at about this point in the podcast

814
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm guessing that some you
are thinking, okay, great.

815
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,680
I want more dopamine.

816
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,120
I want to be more motivated.

817
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,200
I don't wanna procrastinate as much

818
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,600
and I want to be able to experience life.

819
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
I want these here and now
molecules to be released as well.

820
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,400
Well, there is a way to
do that, but you have to

821
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,880
understand the source of
procrastination is not one thing.

822
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
There are basically two kinds

823
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,560
of procrastinators or
so says the research.

824
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
The first kind are people
that actually really

825
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,600
enjoy the stress of
the impending deadline.

826
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
It's the only way they
can get into action.

827
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,480
These are people that
really like the feeling of

828
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,720
something being due in
an hour and how activated

829
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
and sharp and focused
that makes them feel.

830
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,640
Those people are people that are tapping

831
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,200
into the epinephrin
system, the stress system

832
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,440
and for which the stress really tightens

833
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,760
their ability to see it creates that

834
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,520
soda straw view of the world.

835
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,120
It creates an action element

836
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,600
in the body that makes them
feel like they wanna move.

837
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
It really eliminates all
the distractions for them.

838
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,240
So they're actually leveraging
stress internal stress

839
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,040
in order to achieve a
state that they can't

840
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,240
seem to otherwise achieve.

841
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,480
I won't tell you what to do

842
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,960
in order to overcome all
kinds of procrastination

843
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,360
but from a logical
perspective, it makes sense

844
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,000
therefore, for those
kinds of people to think

845
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
about other ways that
they can get their system

846
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,120
into activation, I've talked

847
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,400
about this in previous podcasts

848
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,120
but a couple of those tools might be the

849
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
what we called super oxygenation breathing

850
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,520
which I admit is not
always super oxygenating.

851
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,960
So this would be if didn't
want it to consume anything.

852
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,320
This could be 25 or 30 cycles of

853
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
in deep inhales and exhales.

854
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,840
It's likely to create some
anxiety and a low level stress.

855
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,520
If you're someone who's
prone to panic attacks

856
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,159
I wouldn't recommend this, but
it's pretty straight forward.

857
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,079
It will deploy adrenaline
into your system.

858
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,880
And you will find that your
visual field is focused

859
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,400
and you will be able to work

860
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,120
and focus better than if
you just kinda waited around

861
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,080
for some wave of motivation
to wash over you.

862
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,760
Normally you're waiting

863
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,920
for that deadline to come into sight

864
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,679
and then that's what the stimulus is.

865
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,759
But you can self-direct adrenaline release

866
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,280
without ingesting anything.

867
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,920
You can also ingest coffee, caffeine

868
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,480
or Mate or something
like that, which is what

869
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,320
I prefer very often to
coffee, which has caffeine.

870
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,640
Caffeine does release
dopamine at low levels

871
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,600
how much it releases
dopamine it isn't clear.

872
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,320
It seems to increase
firing in these neurons

873
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,400
in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%

874
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
which is a pretty low level,

875
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,680
but it can create agitation so for

876
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,720
caffeine sensitive people,
that could be a problem.

877
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,960
I've talked before about things

878
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,720
like L tyrosine the precursor
to dopamine or Mucuna Purina.

879
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,080
I talked about that in the last episode

880
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,600
but if you didn't see
that, just to remind you

881
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,240
L tyrosine is present in red meats,

882
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
it's in certain nuts and L tyrosine

883
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,320
is the precursor to dopamine.

884
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,640
You can supplement L tyrosine.

885
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,120
If you like, you will get a
big inflection in dopamine

886
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,040
but there is a crash associated with it.

887
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,080
However, it will increase
motivation in the short term

888
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,000
not suggesting anyone do this.

889
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,840
I wanna be very clear to
say what I always say.

890
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm not a doctor.

891
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,920
I don't prescribe anything.

892
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,720
I'm a professor.

893
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,680
I profess things.

894
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,240
You have to know whether or not
these things are appropriate

895
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,560
for your mental and
physical health or not.

896
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,000
So you need to consult a doctor.

897
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,040
For instance, people who
suffer from schizotypal

898
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,520
or schizophrenia or
mania should probably not

899
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,840
be taking supplements that
increase their dopamine levels.

900
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,840
Now, if you can't increase your level

901
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,760
of focus and your level of alertness

902
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,160
and your level of motivation
using breathing well

903
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,560
then there might be
something else at play.

904
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,000
There are other procrastinators

905
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,880
for which they simply are not
releasing enough dopamine.

906
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
They're not making enough dopamine.

907
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
And for those people

908
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
there are a variety of things
that can increase dopamine.

909
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,480
I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist

910
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
or doctor I've talked about Mucuna Purina,

911
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,000
which is 99.9%. L-DOPA
the precursor to dopamine.

912
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
So there are people
that do much better when

913
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,840
they take things that increase
their dopamine levels.

914
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,960
There are antidepressants
like Wellbutrin Pru prior own

915
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,120
which increase is the other name for it

916
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,200
which increased dopamine and epinephrin,

917
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,360
it can increase risk of epileptic attacks

918
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,080
if you're epileptic.

919
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,000
So again, you have to talk to your doctor

920
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,120
but they will increase dopamine
and motivation and focus.

921
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,840
However, if you think back

922
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,400
to our earlier discussion
about dopamine, dopamine

923
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,080
if it's very high, creates
a sense of pleasure

924
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,000
and the desire for more,

925
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,320
so you can also become a person

926
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
for which enough is never enough.

927
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,440
The only thing that dopamine
really wants is more

928
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,120
of the thing that releases dopamine

929
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,040
and so big inflections in dopamine,

930
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
whether or not they come from cocaine

931
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,040
or whether or not they come
from a supplementation,

932
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,440
caffeine exercise study regime

933
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,320
will just make you want more of something

934
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,720
and we've all heard
before of growth mindset

935
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
this incredible discovery of my colleague,

936
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,720
Carol Dweck where some of
these positive mindsets

937
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,800
that the psychology
community has put forth

938
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,960
as really good for pursuit of goals

939
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,800
and pursuit of things that
require long bouts of effort.

940
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,760
Well, it's wonderful if you
can learn to attach dopamine

941
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
to that process psychologically, but

942
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,840
if you're starting to augment the amount

943
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,040
of dopamine increase the amount

944
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,960
of dopamine through things
like supplementation

945
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,000
and prescription drugs
what's gonna happen is

946
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
you're not only gonna need to pursue more

947
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,680
and more of the sorts of things

948
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,160
that are associated with the dopamine.

949
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
So more doing more studying, more sport

950
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,520
more pursuit, higher
mountains, more money,

951
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,280
more whatever but we know that over time,

952
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,200
the mirror image of that

953
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,560
the pain of lack of
accomplishment will also increase.

954
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,240
This is the pleasure pain relationship

955
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,840
that we talked about earlier.

956
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,520
So in a few moments, I'm gonna talk

957
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,960
about how to think about
healthy dopamine schedules

958
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
but I just wanna take a
step back for a second

959
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,280
and talk a little bit about
the flip side of Dolby

960
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,600
and what happens after this
so-called dopamine crash

961
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,160
what mechanisms are installed in us,

962
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,960
because believe it or not,

963
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,560
there are mechanisms that are installed

964
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,440
in all of us that really put the complete

965
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,000
and total break on
dopamine, why they're there

966
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,440
and what they do because
you've experienced these before

967
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,560
and there are actually ways
that you can navigate them.

968
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
These dopamine crashes
are these intentional

969
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
dopamine suppression mechanisms

970
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,240
in order to leverage
healthier dopamine schedules

971
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,520
and to feel more motivated.

972
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,720
Perhaps one of the most
fundamental mechanisms

973
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,040
in all humans is the
neuro circuitry designed

974
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,520
for seeking out mates and for reproduction

975
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,920
and that's because the continuation

976
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,480
of any one species is the
primary driver for any species.

977
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,760
That's just the reality.

978
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,600
Now I'm removing all context here.

979
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,760
So whatever I say, of course, it's

980
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,949
on a backdrop of consensual age

981
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:25,680
appropriate species, appropriate context,

982
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,120
appropriate all of that.

983
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,000
This is not about the sociology
of reproduction and sex.

984
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,680
This is about the biology,

985
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,280
the biology of sex in males and females

986
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,520
doesn't matter if it's XX chromosome X

987
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,320
Y chromosome X, X, Y
X, Y Y doesn't matter.

988
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,000
The reality is that dopamine is released

989
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,080
on anticipation and consummation
of sex and reproduction.

990
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
And after orgasm, regardless
of chromosomal background

991
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,040
there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine

992
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,000
and an increase in a
hormone called prolactin.

993
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
Now, prolactin is associated

994
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,200
with milk let-down in lactating mothers.

995
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,880
It's also present in males and in general

996
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,800
prolactin creates a sense
of lethargy of stillness

997
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,400
and lack of desire to move

998
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,320
and lack of desire to pursue more

999
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,800
of whatever released the dopamine.

1000
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,680
Prolactin in fact, sets
the refractory period

1001
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
on a male's ability to mate again

1002
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,200
now this is gonna vary tremendously

1003
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,880
from individual to individual.

1004
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,200
It also can, there are data showing

1005
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,120
that it can vary tremendously

1006
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,680
from mate pairing to
mate pairing the number

1007
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,040
one thing that releases
dopamine is novelty

1008
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,800
and it is true that the
refractory period is shortened

1009
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
by the introduction of novel mates.

1010
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,240
This was first shown in a kind

1011
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,320
of classic experiment in
of all things in chickens.

1012
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,840
This is called the Coolidge effect

1013
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
and the story is the story goes

1014
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
and I believe it's a true story,

1015
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
it's actually in all the
neuroendocrinology textbooks.

1016
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,320
So I believe it's true is

1017
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,080
that president Calvin Coolidge

1018
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,600
was visiting a chicken farm.

1019
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,280
They were is being taken
around and the person who was

1020
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
hosting the visit showed them

1021
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
a rooster that was Coolidge and his wife

1022
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
were on the visit and said

1023
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,840
"this rooster copulates
thousands of times per day."

1024
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
And Mrs. Coolidge apparently

1025
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,400
kind of elbowed president Coolidge

1026
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
and said, "ah, you hear
that" kind of like pointing

1027
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,040
out the prowess of this rooster
and Coolidge said," yeah

1028
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
but let me ask you a question,

1029
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,400
same hen or different hens."

1030
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,320
It turns out it was different hens.

1031
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,760
And the reason is the introduction

1032
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,240
of a novel mate increases dopamine levels.

1033
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,920
And what's interesting about this is that

1034
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,520
after copulation prolactin
goes through the roof

1035
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,200
and prevents further
copulation dopamine crashes

1036
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,120
but the introduction of some
sort of novelty shortens this.

1037
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,040
Now this is not a ploy for people

1038
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,360
to change mates often what this

1039
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,400
is a story about the
dopamine and prolactin system

1040
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,240
that also exists in humans.

1041
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,280
Now, there are actually things that people

1042
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,120
in certain communities take

1043
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,200
in order to bypass these
refractory periods.

1044
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,400
There's actually drugs
that increase dopamine

1045
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
suppress prolactin and vice versa.

1046
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,040
There's actually another
way to suppress prolactin.

1047
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,160
Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent
prolactin inhibitor as a zinc.

1048
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
And if you look out there

1049
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,400
in the literature and for those either

1050
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,640
in the wellness and cost
sports performance community

1051
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,280
a lot of the so-called
quote unquote testosterone

1052
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,160
boosters are actually
combinations of vitamin B6

1053
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,320
and zinc which inhibit prolactin

1054
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,760
and by way of inhibiting
prolactin increase dopamine.

1055
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,840
So they do have some functional
effect in that regard.

1056
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
They're not really increasing
testosterone directly

1057
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,760
they're suppressing prolactin levels.

1058
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,280
And there are clinical conditions
like hyperprolactinemia

1059
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,120
which leads to massive
decreases in libido, et cetera.

1060
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,800
And there are prescription drugs to

1061
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
treat hyperprolactinemia, which of course

1062
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,600
you should always talk
to an endocrinologist

1063
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,680
about those sorts of prescription drugs.

1064
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,560
So it's interesting that
this very basic mechanism

1065
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,440
of dopamine and prolactin,
this sort of motivation,

1066
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,800
no more motivation is
a system that evolved

1067
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,760
for reproduction first, but
that actually takes place.

1068
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,000
And you can see in elsewhere
in the world, for instance

1069
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
schizophrenia disease that
has many different types

1070
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,840
and facets, but schizophrenia
is a case of an often

1071
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,240
of hyperactivation of the dopamine system

1072
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,440
so much so that it can make
people feel kind of high,

1073
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
they hallucinate, I
mean, we're talking very

1074
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,600
very high or dysregulated
dopamine circuits in the brain.

1075
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,680
One of the treatments for schizophrenia

1076
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,160
are drugs that block dopamine receptors.

1077
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,520
And if you have the it's unfortunate,

1078
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
there are so many people that are out

1079
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,960
on the street these days
who have schizophrenia,

1080
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,160
some of whom are taking their meds,

1081
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,680
some of who, whom aren't

1082
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,880
if you ever see somebody on
the street that's doing what's

1083
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,200
it's like a lip smacking and writhing

1084
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,680
it's actually called tardive dyskinesia.

1085
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,440
This is a movement disorder that's created

1086
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,080
by taking these anti dopaminergic drugs.

1087
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,800
So you can imagine these
anti-doping synergic drugs

1088
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,120
while being very effective
in suppressing hallucinations

1089
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,280
they create these movement problems

1090
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,600
because of dopamines importance

1091
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,960
for the movement circuitry
so-called pyramidal circuitry

1092
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,000
for the aficionados.

1093
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,760
In addition, you sometimes see

1094
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,560
in males that take these drugs, drugs

1095
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,840
like haloperidol and the
other dopamine blockers

1096
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,400
that they actually develop
breast tissue gynecomastia.

1097
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,600
So the development of
male breast tissue is

1098
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,000
because of the elevated
levels of prolactin

1099
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,320
because they're suppressing
their dopamine so much.

1100
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,680
Now that's a really extreme
case, but maybe perhaps

1101
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,120
if you see somebody engaging
these very strange kind

1102
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,520
of face riding and body riding behaviors

1103
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,920
that's actually not a consequence
of their mental illness.

1104
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,040
That's a consequence
most often of the drugs

1105
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,880
that they're taking to
treat the mental illness.

1106
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
Those are side effects of those drugs.

1107
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,600
Now prolactin is increased any time.

1108
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,240
We have some really
heightened, intense experience.

1109
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,600
It's not just released
after sex and reproduction.

1110
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,120
Prolactin is released
after some major event,

1111
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,560
it's actually responsible

1112
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,240
thought for some of postpartum depression

1113
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,040
for different types of kind
of the, the let down the low.

1114
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,120
I can distinctly remember
that after finals or

1115
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,640
after publishing a big paper,
I would be very, very happy

1116
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,800
but then I'd find that, Oh, you know

1117
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,360
like what next or things
might seem a little bit dimmed

1118
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,480
or dulled out for the next day
or so, or the following week.

1119
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,840
The timescales on these are gonna vary

1120
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,760
because some people
release a lot of dopamine

1121
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,640
for a very long time in
response to something great

1122
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,960
and other people have a quick inflection

1123
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,280
of dopamine and then they're
back to feeling not so great.

1124
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,360
It really varies from person to person.

1125
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,600
In fact, long ago, I started

1126
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,680
as I learned about
dopamine reward circuitry

1127
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,800
and the relationship would be

1128
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
between dopamine and prolactin.

1129
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,280
I started to leverage
this, believe it or not.

1130
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,960
After some major event

1131
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,680
I would take a couple 100
milligrams of vitamin B6.

1132
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,920
I think for people who
have diabetic neuropathy

1133
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,880
you need to be careful

1134
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,960
with vitamin B6 check with your doctor.

1135
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,440
I was told, although I
haven't found the literature

1136
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,920
on this that it can, in some cases

1137
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,080
exacerbate peripheral neuropathy, but

1138
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,160
for most people it's thought
to be reasonably safe

1139
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
but again, always check
with your physician

1140
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,080
but I would take some B6 to
kind of offset some of that low.

1141
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,920
And I actually, I don't know
if it was subjective or not

1142
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,600
but it seemed to have
somewhat of a positive effect.

1143
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,880
I also started just internalizing the fact

1144
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,800
that dopamine is so subjective.

1145
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,120
There are objective aspects to dopamine

1146
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,320
and how much is released

1147
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,520
but there's also some
subjective effects to dopamine.

1148
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,440
And so one of the things that you can do

1149
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,080
in order to generally
just be a happier person

1150
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,560
especially if you're a person
in pursuit of long-term goals

1151
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,800
of any kind is the longer
that you can extend

1152
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,680
that positive phase of
the dopamine release.

1153
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,280
And the more that you can
blunt the pain response to that

1154
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,360
the better, and you can
actually do this cognitively.

1155
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,560
I used to joke with my lab
that when we'd publish a paper

1156
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,720
I would get really excited, but I wouldn't

1157
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,680
allow myself to get too excited
what I wanted to do instead

1158
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,880
and what I've still tried to do is try

1159
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,320
and extend the arc of
that positive experience

1160
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,000
as long as I possibly can simply

1161
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,760
by thinking back like,
Oh, that was really cool.

1162
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,200
I really enjoy doing that work.

1163
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,360
I really enjoyed the discovery.

1164
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,120
I really enjoy doing that with the people

1165
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,360
that I was working with at the time,

1166
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,880
what a pleasure that was.

1167
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,080
I can get this very easily

1168
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,320
from pictures of people,
in things like Costello

1169
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,800
that I really enjoy trips that I've taken.

1170
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,320
So you can extend pleasure

1171
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,360
without having to engage in
the behavior over and over.

1172
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,720
That's extending the arc of
that dopamine release as well.

1173
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,560
It offset some of the pain

1174
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,000
of not having that experience occur over

1175
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,280
and over and over again.

1176
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,880
Now for the high performers out there

1177
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,840
you're probably familiar

1178
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,240
with this many people who
have a big achievement.

1179
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,080
Their first thoughts are will now, what

1180
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,040
what am I gonna do next?

1181
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,240
How am I ever gonna exceed that?

1182
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,880
And indeed many people who are very high

1183
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,560
on this kind of dopamine sensation

1184
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,600
and novelty seeking scale
are prone to addiction.

1185
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,520
They're prone to the rabid pursuit

1186
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,560
of external goals of external
perception to the neglect

1187
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,720
of these internal mechanisms
that allow them to

1188
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
feel calm and happy.

1189
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,880
So for people that are
very driven, very motivated

1190
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,320
adopting a practice of
being able to engage

1191
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,520
in the here and now the sort

1192
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,840
of almond type practices
we talked about earlier

1193
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,920
of learning how to achieve
a really good night's sleep

1194
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,960
on a regular basis through
tools and mechanisms I talked

1195
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,120
about in previous podcasts gives us sort

1196
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,120
of balance to the pleasure
seeking for an offsetting

1197
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,680
of pain and the pleasure
in the here and now.

1198
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,440
So pleasure is really two things.

1199
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,520
It's a joy in pursuit

1200
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
but it's also the joy in what you have.

1201
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,040
And there's a beautiful model

1202
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,520
of emotional development
that was developed

1203
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,440
by Alan shore professor at UCLA

1204
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,720
and psychiatrist that talks
about some of the basics

1205
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,520
of good infant parent attachment

1206
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,600
where good parenting that leads

1207
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,760
to healthy adult relationships

1208
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,080
and emotion regulation
tends to include both sides

1209
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,280
of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.

1210
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,760
We talk about the
relationship between child

1211
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,800
and parent typically was
the mother, but also father

1212
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,200
where you can get the child really excited

1213
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,800
by kind of squealing and ramping them

1214
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,200
up or talking about something
or ice cream or play.

1215
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,560
And the kid gets very excited.

1216
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,000
That's the dopaminergic system

1217
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,120
the anticipation of something
that's coming, but as well

1218
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,760
engaging with children
in a way that's really

1219
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,280
about everything that you have right

1220
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,520
in the here and now,
the reading of the book

1221
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,000
the kids always seem to ask one more time.

1222
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,720
One more.

1223
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,880
They seem to want more of
the things that they enjoy

1224
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,200
but really engaging with them

1225
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,920
in a way that increases
their sense of pleasure

1226
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,560
for what's right there, as
well as giving them a lot

1227
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,680
of things to be excited about
and positive anticipation.

1228
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,320
Now, having worked years ago
with at-risk kids and also

1229
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,800
with young kids at summer
camps and things like that

1230
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
one of the things that you
learn is you never say maybe

1231
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,360
to a kid about a reward.

1232
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
If you say, we might have ice cream later

1233
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,920
you are essentially saying
we are having ice cream.

1234
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,440
They don't hear the maybe part

1235
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,760
and it turns out adults don't either.

1236
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,560
It's really interesting.

1237
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,720
There's something called
reward prediction error.

1238
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,920
I've talked about this before

1239
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,560
but I haven't really talked
about it deeply in the context

1240
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,440
of the dopamine system,
dopamine, as I've said,

1241
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,000
is involved in anticipation of wanting,

1242
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,760
not of having it's involved

1243
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,320
in motivation toward
the thing that you want.

1244
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,000
And it biases us towards action.

1245
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,920
Reward prediction, error
equals the actual amount

1246
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,680
of dopamine that's released in response

1247
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,440
to something versus minus
the amount that's expected.

1248
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,440
Okay. So if you tell a kid,
we might have ice cream

1249
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,400
they hear we're gonna have
ice cream and they expect it.

1250
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,640
And if you later say, well

1251
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,080
we're not gonna have ice cream

1252
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,560
and I said, maybe that's
actually gonna lead

1253
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,600
to a much bigger crash in dopamine.

1254
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,240
It's going to lead to a negative signal,

1255
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,440
a punishment signal.

1256
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,600
It's literally going to feel like pain.

1257
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,040
So kids, you can leverage this.

1258
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,040
If your parents say

1259
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,440
maybe they're effectively
telling your dopamine system

1260
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,080
absolutely. Now adults are like this too.

1261
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,040
If we think something might
happen and it doesn't happen

1262
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,520
there's a big crash in our aspect,

1263
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,840
in our emotionality and that's because

1264
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,520
that dopamine system goes from firing

1265
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,440
about three to four times per second

1266
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,840
to about 10 or 15 times per second

1267
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,560
in the possibility that
something might happen

1268
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,600
possibility is deeply
woven into our biology

1269
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000
of the dopamine and motivation system,

1270
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,200
as a way for us presumably
in ancient times

1271
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
to explore novel territories

1272
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
and get a sense that
maybe there's water there.

1273
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,240
Maybe there are mates there.

1274
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,520
Maybe there's better food there

1275
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,360
maybe there's resources there.

1276
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,040
The maybe is important thing

1277
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,520
that in language terms
maybe means maybe, but

1278
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,040
in neuro-biological
terms maybe means perhaps

1279
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,400
there's going to be the surprise

1280
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,720
of an even bigger dopamine reward.

1281
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,560
And the one thing dopamine loves more

1282
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,880
than anything else is surprise.

1283
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,000
When we get something
positive, we go to the mailbox

1284
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,760
we're expecting some bills and you open it

1285
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,800
up and you get a letter

1286
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
from somebody you haven't
thought about in a long time.

1287
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,840
And you adore that person.

1288
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
That's a huge dopamine release.

1289
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,720
It actually triggers neuroplasticity.

1290
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,840
You probably never forget that

1291
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,560
because of the way that
dopamine Gates' plasticity.

1292
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,960
When we get an, a surprise

1293
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,080
of something that we didn't want,

1294
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,480
also it creates plasticity.

1295
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,000
So the surprise, novelty,
motivation, and reward

1296
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,360
they're all woven into this
package that we call dopamine.

1297
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,920
And the cool thing is you can actually

1298
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,720
regulate this whole system
in a way that will steer you

1299
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,440
or lean you towards more
positive anticipation

1300
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
of things in life and less disappointment.

1301
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,400
It's simply a matter

1302
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,360
of adjusting what we call
the dopamine schedule.

1303
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,840
Okay. A couple things before we continue,

1304
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,320
we're gonna talk about attention
deficit in a few minutes.

1305
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,680
But before that, I wanna talk

1306
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,600
about something that I've mentioned before

1307
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,680
in previous podcasts, but
that you may not be aware of

1308
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,600
and if you're aware of
you may still be doing,

1309
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,080
which is severely injuring your
ability to release dopamine

1310
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,040
it's creating a sense of
disappointment in ways

1311
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,160
that are most likely hurting
you mentally and physically.

1312
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,320
And that's the blunting of dopamine

1313
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
by viewing light in
the middle of the night

1314
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,160
I realized this is not
a discussion about sleep

1315
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,320
and circadian rhythms,
but the data now are so

1316
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,200
strong showing that viewing bright light

1317
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,480
from about 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM
too often triggers activation

1318
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,800
of this circuit called the habenula

1319
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,080
So this is eye to

1320
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,200
It goes from your retina

1321
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,160
to a structure called the
habenula H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A

1322
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,840
Then from the habenula to
some of this reward circuitry

1323
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
and it suppresses the
activation of the reward.

1324
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,440
Circuitry, not just in
that moment, but to things

1325
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,800
that you normally positively
anticipate and pursue.

1326
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,680
And the reason I'm bring this

1327
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,960
up now is because I haven't really gone

1328
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,080
into depth on the dopamine
system before now, you understand

1329
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,600
that you have this very
precious reward system.

1330
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,200
That's kind of a double-edged sword.

1331
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,160
It needs to be taken
care of and treated well.

1332
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,280
You wanna use it, but
not overuse it, et cetera

1333
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,600
but getting bright light
exposure in the middle

1334
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,960
of the night is reducing your
capacity to release dopamine.

1335
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,520
So it's not just

1336
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,600
about the sleep that you're
not getting in that time.

1337
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,880
It's also that you're
not getting the dopamine

1338
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,040
that would otherwise be available to you.

1339
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,200
So you're actually taking, think of light

1340
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,880
in the middle of the night as a kind

1341
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,760
of antagonist is kind of
a blocker of dopamine.

1342
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,120
Maybe that'll help you.

1343
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,160
If you're somebody who has to work

1344
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,120
in the middle of the night

1345
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,840
and you wanna bypass
this dopamine suppression

1346
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,400
please see the episode
about jet lag and shift work

1347
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,880
because there are a lot

1348
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
of tips there that will
allow you to do that

1349
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,520
in order to understand how to
control the dopamine system

1350
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,600
how to leverage it for a better life.

1351
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,560
You need to understand the results

1352
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,160
of a very important experiment.

1353
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,520
This experiment was able
to separate pleasure

1354
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,880
from motivation.

1355
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,480
It's a very simple, but
like many simple experiments

1356
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,520
a very elegant experiment, what they did

1357
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,960
and this has now been done in animals.

1358
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,320
and in humans, they offered rats food.

1359
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,880
It was a food that they particularly liked

1360
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,240
and the animals would lever
press for a pellet of food

1361
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,800
kind of classic experiment
that eat the food

1362
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,040
and they presumably liked the food

1363
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,440
because they were motivated,
press the lever and eat it.

1364
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,080
Great. They took other rats.

1365
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,680
They eliminated the dopamine neurons.

1366
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,720
You can do this by injection

1367
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,360
of a neurotoxin that
destroys these neurons.

1368
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,680
So they actually had no
dopamine in their brain.

1369
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,520
They have no ability to release dopamine

1370
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,600
and they gave them a lever
that rats would sit there

1371
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,200
and they'd hit the lever
and they'd eat the food.

1372
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,360
They're still enjoyed the food.

1373
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,440
So you say, well, okay

1374
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,280
so dopamine is involved in motivation.

1375
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,720
It is involved in pleasure.

1376
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,160
No, it absolutely is.

1377
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,800
They could still enjoy the
food, but if they moved the rat

1378
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,680
literally one body length
away from the lever.

1379
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,960
What they found was the animals
that had dopamine would move

1380
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,720
over to the lever, press it and eat.

1381
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,000
And the ones, the rats that
did not have dopamine available

1382
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,320
to them, wouldn't even move
one body lane, one rat length

1383
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,000
to the lever in order to
press it and get the food.

1384
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,760
Dopamine, therefore is not

1385
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,640
about the ability to experience pleasure,

1386
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,880
it is about motivation for pleasure.

1387
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,680
This has been repeated in humans

1388
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,600
in a variety of different scenarios.

1389
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,000
You can't really do the lever
press thing quite as easily

1390
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,760
but we know that people have low levels

1391
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,480
of dopamine are simply less motivated

1392
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,320
even though they can achieve pleasure.

1393
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,720
And this has serious ramifications

1394
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,347
for the fact that now, quote

1395
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:53,680
unquote pleasure or ways
to induce things that we

1396
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,400
believe give us pleasure are everywhere.

1397
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,360
And they're within reach.

1398
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,880
We don't have to forage for our food.

1399
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,400
There's lot of highly
processed, high sugar

1400
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,600
high fat foods.

1401
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,920
There's also foods that are
healthy, that tastes good

1402
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,840
but they're hopefully
they're pretty easy to

1403
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,160
get all that different
people have different access

1404
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,800
to things, of course, but dopamine

1405
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,280
isn't about the ability
to experience pleasure.

1406
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,800
It's about how motivated you
are to reach those pleasures.

1407
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,760
And so many of you are
probably thinking, wow

1408
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,280
I'm not a very motivated person.

1409
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:23,680
Like you talked

1410
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,440
about the one kind of
procrastination earlier.

1411
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,440
What about when I just feel
kind of met about life now

1412
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,600
for some of you, there may
be a real clinical depression

1413
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,120
and you should talk to a professional.

1414
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,040
There are very good prescription drugs

1415
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,200
that can really help people.

1416
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,360
There's also great non drug
treatments of psychotherapy

1417
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,880
and other treatments
that are being developed

1418
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,760
in addition to psychotherapy
in the various kinds

1419
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,720
of psychoanalysis, et
cetera, that one can use.

1420
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,840
I think the data really points

1421
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,360
to the fact that a combination

1422
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,600
of pharmacology and talk
therapies are generally best.

1423
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,120
And there are a huge
range of these things.

1424
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,640
I know many of you are
in these professions.

1425
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,400
We're not gonna talk about that right now.

1426
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,200
There's a compound.

1427
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,200
That's kind of interesting
in the supplement

1428
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,480
space that isn't MaCuna appearing, L-DOPA

1429
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,680
it's not L tyrosine that isn't
promoting massive releases

1430
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,240
of dopamine or even dopamine alone

1431
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,880
but a combination of
dopamine and serotonin.

1432
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,320
And it's an intriguing molecule
it's sold over the counter.

1433
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,920
Again, you have to check
with your healthcare provider

1434
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
before you would take
anything or remove anything.

1435
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,560
That's very important, which
is, but it's, fenal ethyl

1436
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:38,800
fenal Ethel aiming, or P-E-A
pea or beta fenal Ethel

1437
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,640
aiming releases dopamine at low levels

1438
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,480
but also serotonin and low level.

1439
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,480
So it's kind of a cocktail
of the motivation molecules

1440
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,040
as well as the quote unquote
here and now molecules.

1441
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,800
And people's response
to this varies widely

1442
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,640
but many people report
feeling heightened sense

1443
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,120
of mental acuity wellbeing, et cetera.

1444
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,800
It is a bit of a stimulant

1445
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,160
like anything that triggers activation

1446
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,560
of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway

1447
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,000
but is an interesting supplement.

1448
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,840
I actually haven't tried it before.

1449
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,160
So I can't report on my own experiences.

1450
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,840
I will point you however, to examine.com.

1451
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,760
It wouldn't be a Huberman
Lab Podcast episode.

1452
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,280
If I didn't point you to examine.com

1453
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,840
this incredible free
resource where you can put

1454
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,880
in any supplement.

1455
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,880
And it will tell you the
quote unquote human effect

1456
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,040
matrix it'll point you
to the various studies.

1457
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,880
We always provide a link
to this in the caption.

1458
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,480
It's an amazing resource.

1459
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,800
So you can go there to explore more

1460
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,760
but I haven't talked about
beta Fino, L Ethel, Amy

1461
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,880
and before in previous podcasts

1462
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,240
and I wanted to add it to
the list of things that tap

1463
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,840
into the dopamine system that are in this.

1464
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,080
I guess we call it now
the supplementation space.

1465
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,240
I personally am fascinated
by these supplements

1466
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,400
and the things that
exist out there that are

1467
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,600
non-prescription that seem to, at least

1468
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,080
in some people have positive effects.

1469
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,200
For instance, last episode

1470
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,400
we talked about CDOT
L-carnitine, which there

1471
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,720
are several papers that
report antidepressant effects

1472
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,840
as well as positive effects

1473
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,840
on other things, sperm health,
ovarian health, et cetera.

1474
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,640
I learned from a colleague
that acetyl L-carnitine

1475
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,800
in Europe is actually a prescription drug

1476
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,960
in the US it's sold over the counter.

1477
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,720
So I guess, depending on
where you're listening to this

1478
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,640
the availability might vary.

1479
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,640
And as always, I put the
caveat, you have to check

1480
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,400
with your healthcare provider,
if it's right for you

1481
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,080
but I'm fascinated by the fact

1482
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,120
that these things exist
and that they lie somewhere

1483
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,640
between prescription
drugs and doing nothing.

1484
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,880
And that makes them interesting compounds.

1485
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,520
And I think that P-E-A
beta fennel ethylamine is

1486
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,160
yet another one of the, of such compounds.

1487
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,480
I going to talk a lot
about attention deficit

1488
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,800
and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder

1489
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,440
in a future episode, but I
do wanna mention it today

1490
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,960
in the context of
dopamine and impulsivity.

1491
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,560
So ADHD or ADD so attention deficit

1492
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,600
hyperactivity disorder,
ADD our clinical diagnoses.

1493
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,080
I think a lot of people
nowadays walk around and say

1494
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,240
I have ADD or you have ADD

1495
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,280
and indeed one can create a sort

1496
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,240
of ADD by attention
switching all the time.

1497
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,480
I'm a big fan of Cal Newport.

1498
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,680
He wrote the book" deep work."

1499
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,960
I believe he was the one who said context

1500
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,880
switching is terrible for the brain.

1501
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,480
It's like the worst thing for the brain

1502
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,200
because then the brain
learns to context, switch

1503
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,040
and real deep work productivity,
learning of all kinds

1504
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,400
good relationships of all kinds

1505
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,320
really come from depth of experience

1506
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,160
not from breadth of
experience within the moment.

1507
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,120
And so I think it's important to know that

1508
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,280
there's clinical ADHD and ADD

1509
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,640
and then there's the
kind that people are kind

1510
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,040
of inducing and through distraction

1511
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,440
and social media and phones, et cetera.

1512
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,400
And those can sometimes lead
to clinical ADHD and ADD

1513
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,840
But I wanna talk about ADHD
and ADD in kids just briefly

1514
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:05,920
the drugs that are normally
given to treat those conditions

1515
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,680
ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall

1516
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,480
things that have very
amphetamine, light qualities

1517
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,360
and structures, and you might
ask, why would they do that?

1518
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,920
Well, it turns out that in kids

1519
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,560
these activate that for brain circuitry

1520
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,360
the break that exists on the
deeper mesolimbic circuitry.

1521
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,792
So as you recall, there's
the VTA and nucleus accumbens

1522
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:31,520
as the kind of accelerators on dopamine.

1523
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,800
And then there's the prefrontal cortex

1524
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,160
which acts as a break and
can limit impulsivity.

1525
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,400
And those drugs tend to
increase the activity

1526
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,440
of neurons in that pathway,
the prefrontal cortex

1527
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,880
and it reduces impulsivity.

1528
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,760
In fact, there's a experiment
described in the book

1529
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,080
"the molecule of more,"
which is really interesting

1530
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,680
where they looked at
impulsivity in obese children

1531
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,240
and it turns out they did this experiment

1532
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,040
in a safe way that they looked at kids

1533
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
both obese kids and non obese kids

1534
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,520
and their willingness to
cross a very busy highway.

1535
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,440
And it turns out that
the obese kids got hit

1536
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,440
by cars more often than
non obese children.

1537
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,680
It turns out this was a
virtual reality experiment

1538
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,480
and it had nothing to do

1539
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,760
with the fact that they were obese

1540
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,480
or limitations on movement
or speed of movement.

1541
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,800
It was that the obese
children were more impulsive

1542
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,000
in a variety of contexts

1543
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,560
not just in this virtual
crossing the street thing.

1544
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,360
And it turns out the
data point to the fact

1545
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,040
that impulsivity at age
10 is actually predictive

1546
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,880
of overeating disorders
at a later stage in life.

1547
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,280
So some of these drugs
that are designed to

1548
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,320
create heightened activity
in the braking system

1549
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,400
the decelerator

1550
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,000
of the reward pathway are
designed to reduce impulsivity

1551
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,400
because they suppress
the release of dopamine

1552
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,480
and they allow, hopefully
they allow children and it

1553
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,160
and when they become adults
to better control the schedule

1554
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,520
of dopamine release.

1555
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,760
So now let's talk about
what is a dopamine schedule

1556
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,360
and how you can leverage this

1557
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,800
in order to have heightened
levels of motivation

1558
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,240
but not get so much dopamine

1559
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,480
that you're experiencing
or a crash afterwards.

1560
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,960
And also, so that you can
experience heightened pleasure

1561
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,320
from the various pursuits
that you are engaged in life.

1562
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,920
I know many of you are interested

1563
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,920
in tools that will allow
you to be more motivated

1564
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,880
to focus longer, sleep better.

1565
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,360
That's really what the Huberman
Lab Podcast is all about

1566
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,920
but always framed in the context

1567
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,680
of neuro-biological principles
and objective mechanisms.

1568
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,400
There are some tools that we can apply

1569
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,840
to the dopamine system

1570
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,600
and motivation that can really
improve our ability to stay

1571
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,640
in pursuit of things,
as well as enjoy things

1572
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,320
after we've achieved our goals,
or even an route, our goals.

1573
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,720
And here's the key principle.

1574
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,480
Dopamine is very subjective.

1575
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:51,840
Meaning you can

1576
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,640
either allow yourself to
experience the pleasure

1577
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,760
of reaching a milestone of
achieving or some craving or not.

1578
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,840
Now that won't work in
the extreme cases of drugs

1579
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,480
like cocaine and amphetamine,
but it's actually

1580
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,240
pretty powerful what one can
do with the subjective system.

1581
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,080
In fact, I'm gonna describe

1582
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,440
to you an experiment
that highlights just how

1583
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,000
powerful the subjective readout

1584
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,760
or the subjective interpretation

1585
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,440
of a given experience really can be.

1586
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,080
Even at the level of pharmacology.

1587
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,720
I love examples of subjective effects

1588
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,440
over things that would
otherwise seem hardwired

1589
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,080
because they really
illustrate the interplay

1590
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,600
between our cognition, our belief system

1591
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,840
and what would otherwise be these,

1592
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,040
just plug and chug kind of mechanisms of,

1593
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,040
you eat X amount of chocolate

1594
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,040
or you drink X amount of water

1595
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,440
after being water deprived
for a certain amount of time.

1596
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,040
And you get X amount of dopamine.

1597
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,320
Here's the experiment.

1598
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,560
The experiment was just
published on March 18, 2021.

1599
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,400
So very recently, and the title

1600
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,480
of the experiment is expectation

1601
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,880
for stimulant type modifies

1602
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,440
caffeine is effects on mood and cognition

1603
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,120
and this was done in college students.

1604
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,120
And it's a fascinating study.

1605
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:11,680
What they did is they gave
college students either placebo

1606
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,200
essentially nothing or 200
milligrams of caffeine.

1607
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,640
200 milligrams of caffeine is

1608
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,480
about what's in a well, a typical coffee

1609
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,280
like a medium coffee that
you buy a drip coffee

1610
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,120
or a coffee that you'd make at home.

1611
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,320
It's a fair amount of caffeine.

1612
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,760
If you were to take in pill form

1613
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,440
it would definitely
make you feel more alert

1614
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,280
unless you were one of those mutants

1615
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,400
literally mutants that is
insensitive to caffeine.

1616
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,080
And those mutants are pretty rare.

1617
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,640
So they took 65 undergraduate
students in college.

1618
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,600
They randomized them to
either placebo or caffeine

1619
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,680
and they told them

1620
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,560
that they were either
getting caffeine or Adderall.

1621
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,920
Now, Adderall cognitively carries

1622
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,800
a very different expectation.

1623
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,360
College students know
Adderall to be a much

1624
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,280
stronger stimulant than caffeine.

1625
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,600
They know it to create a sort of high.

1626
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,360
This is the way the students described it

1627
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,440
and they thought that it
would increase their level

1628
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,240
of focus and their
ability to perform work.

1629
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,600
So it was really interesting
is there was definitely

1630
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,520
an effect of placebo versus caffeine.

1631
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,080
That's not surprising, however,
right, you take a placebo

1632
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,160
you may or may not feel more alert

1633
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,560
but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine

1634
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,240
very likely you're gonna feel very alert

1635
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,680
but there was also an
effect of whether or not

1636
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,800
the students thought they were
getting caffeine or Adderall.

1637
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,360
The subjects receiving
caffeine reported feeling

1638
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,600
more stimulated, anxious, and motivated

1639
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,360
than the subjects that
received the placebo.

1640
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,000
Okay. But the ones that expected Adderall

1641
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
reported stronger amphetamine effects.

1642
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So they felt much more high.

1643
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,640
They performed better on
a working memory test.

1644
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,520
And in general, they had
all the increased cognitive

1645
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,240
effects that would have
been seen with Adderall

1646
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,240
but they were only ingesting caffeine.

1647
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,240
And so this shows an interaction
between the drug caffeine

1648
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,640
and the expectation that it was Adderall.

1649
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,760
So it led to heightened performance simply

1650
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,240
because the students thought
they were getting Adderall.

1651
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,040
And I don't know whether

1652
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,400
or not they told them at the
end that it wasn't Adderall.

1653
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,680
I doubt that they did this.

1654
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,560
If you wanna look it up

1655
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,000
the study was published in the journal

1656
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,400
of experimental clinical
psychopharmacology.

1657
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,040
The paper is Looby L-O-O-B-Y at all.

1658
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,720
And again, it was just published
March 18th, 2021 speaks

1659
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,240
to the fact that yes, there
are so-called placebo effects

1660
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,680
but this is different than placebo.

1661
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,800
This is a belief effect about
what the specific reactions

1662
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,200
to a given stimulant ought to be.

1663
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,120
And I think this is very
important because I think

1664
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,960
that it points to the fact that the top

1665
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,279
down the kind of higher
level cognitive processes

1666
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,719
are impacting even the most
basic fundamental aspects

1667
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,240
of the say dopamine release

1668
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,359
or our mountain adrenaline
release or epinephrin release

1669
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,999
in ways that can positively
impact performance.

1670
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,840
In this case, it was
a positive improvement

1671
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
in working memory and focus.

1672
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,359
As long as we were talking about caffeine

1673
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,199
I'd like to point out a study.

1674
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,240
That's really interesting.

1675
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,720
This was published in
journal of neuroscience

1676
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,760
which is the society

1677
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,080
for neurosciences kind
of flagship journal.

1678
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,960
It's their journal.

1679
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,160
It's a good journal

1680
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,840
and what they showed was

1681
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,240
that caffeine can
increase dopamine release

1682
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,280
in the brain by about 30%.

1683
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,800
That wasn't surprising.

1684
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,120
I even said that earlier,
but what they also showed is

1685
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,439
that it has a protective
effect on dopamine neurons.

1686
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,479
So caffeine in some cases may not just

1687
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,759
increase dopamine release

1688
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,760
but it might actually
have a protective effect

1689
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,359
on dopamine neurons.

1690
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,719
Now that's distinctly different

1691
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,240
from some claims that drugs
like MDMA ecstasy have been

1692
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,640
it's been argued can, are neurotoxic

1693
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,120
for things like dopamine
and serotonin neurons.

1694
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,800
The study that was published about that

1695
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,200
in the journal science,
which is an extremely

1696
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,280
prestigious excellent
journal later, it was shown

1697
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,840
that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy
that was given in that case.

1698
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,280
It was actually amphetamine,
which is known to

1699
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,240
destroy dopaminergic and
serotonergic neurons.

1700
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:06,960
So what does this mean?

1701
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,520
This means that low levels
of caffeine may at least

1702
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,240
in a few studies be protective
for dopamine neurons

1703
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:16,080
over time that MDMA
ecstasy something that's

1704
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,560
in clinical trials right now
for the treatment of trauma

1705
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,600
PTSD of various kinds and depression

1706
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,120
but still illegal at
this point in time may

1707
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,680
although it doesn't appear
yet from any published studies

1708
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,800
destroy dopaminergic neurons,
perhaps origin, urgent neuron.

1709
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,200
So there's a real asterix
and a question mark there

1710
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,320
but amphetamine and in
particular methamphetamine

1711
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,000
is very destructive for
dopaminergic neurons.

1712
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,560
So I don't think any of
us needed any additional

1713
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,640
reasons to avoid methamphetamine.

1714
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,400
This drug that creates
huge increases in dopamine

1715
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,920
and then huge crashes

1716
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,880
from that dopamine, very destructive drug.

1717
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,520
But in addition

1718
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,640
to that seems to destroy
dopaminergic neurons from time

1719
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,080
to time, I've talked about
nicotine on here, not smoking

1720
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,840
because obviously smoking
is bad lung cancer's bad

1721
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,920
for health, et cetera, but
nicotine in supplemental form

1722
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,320
I've mentioned that a very
famous neuroscientists

1723
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,520
Nobel prize winning scientists
choose a lot of Nicorette.

1724
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,880
I know other people that you Nicorette

1725
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,080
they believe in its
neuroprotective effects

1726
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,760
for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's

1727
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,240
and indeed nicotine can
stimulate dopamine release.

1728
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,520
We talked about that earlier

1729
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,120
whether or not it has a protective effect

1730
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,960
isn't clear the protective
effects might be

1731
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,680
through the noradrenergic
and acetylcholine systems.

1732
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,280
Those findings are still unclear

1733
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,880
but it is interesting to note

1734
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,000
that nicotine can increase prolactin.

1735
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,040
Somewhat. There are a couple

1736
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,560
of studies I'd be happy to link to them

1737
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,760
in the caption that shows
that nicotine taken too much

1738
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,640
over too long periods of time
can also increase prolactin

1739
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,680
which again is the
opposite side of dopamine.

1740
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,360
So today we've talked a lot
about the dopamine system

1741
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,960
and those kinds of schedules
that will allow craving

1742
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,480
or addiction, but what's
the schedule of dopamine.

1743
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,560
That's going to allow you to maximize

1744
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,000
on your pursuit of pleasure
and your elimination of pain.

1745
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,720
And we get the answer to that

1746
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:15,520
from our good friend gambling,
the reason gambling works

1747
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,760
the reason why people will
throw their lives away.

1748
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,960
The reason why people go back
again and again and again

1749
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,680
to places like Las Vegas
and Atlantic city is

1750
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,680
because of the hope and anticipation it's

1751
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:30,960
as those are cities in
places built on dopamine,

1752
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,160
they are leveraging your dopamine system.

1753
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,800
And I realized that there
are experienced gamblers.

1754
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,400
There are people that enjoy gambling.

1755
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,000
I'll actually just say,

1756
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,600
I like sitting at the roulette table.

1757
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,360
I was take a designated amount of money.

1758
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,480
It's not much, I enjoy playing
a little bit of roulette.

1759
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,760
I certainly enjoy when I win.

1760
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,440
I certainly don't like it when I lose

1761
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,440
but I do it cheerly for
the pleasure of playing.

1762
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,720
And I do it very seldom.

1763
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,080
I don't have a gambling problem.

1764
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,360
And if I did, I'd probably tell you

1765
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,520
but I don't have a gambling problem.

1766
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,160
Yet people throw away the
entire lives on gambling.

1767
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,280
And as a friend of mine

1768
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,240
who's a certified addiction
treatment specialist tells me

1769
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,360
that gambling addiction
is a particularly sinister

1770
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,480
because the next time
really could be the thing

1771
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,680
that changes everything.

1772
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,720
Unlike other addictions

1773
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,400
the next time really
could change everything.

1774
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,960
And that's embedded in the
mind of the gambling addict

1775
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,840
and rarely does it work out in favor

1776
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,320
of the wellbeing of the gambling
addict and their family.

1777
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,400
However, the intermittent
reinforcement schedule

1778
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,600
was discovered long ago
by scientific researchers.

1779
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,840
So this is the slot
machine that every once

1780
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,160
in a while gives you a
wind to keep you playing.

1781
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,840
This is the, the probability
of winning on the craps table

1782
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,960
or the roulette table, or at
blackjack just often enough

1783
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,520
that you're willing to buy
tickets, head out there

1784
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,600
play again, go downstairs
again from your room

1785
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,760
even though you swore you
were done for the night

1786
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,200
intermittent reinforcement
is the most powerful form

1787
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,480
of dopamine reward schedule
to keep you doing something

1788
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,840
so we can export that.

1789
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,840
We can use it for good.

1790
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,520
If there's something that
you're pursuing in life

1791
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,360
whether or not it's an academic goal

1792
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,520
or a financial goal, a relationship goal.

1793
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,800
One of the things that
you can do to ensure

1794
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,120
that you will remain on
the path to that goal

1795
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,680
for a very long time, and
that you will continue to

1796
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,400
exceed your previous performance as well

1797
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,040
as continue to enjoy the
dopamine release that

1798
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,520
occurs when you hit the
milestones that you want to

1799
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,960
achieve is to occasionally remove reward

1800
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,480
subjectively, let's say you
set out a goal of making

1801
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,800
I'm gonna make this quantitative
with respect to finances

1802
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,400
'cause it just is an easy description

1803
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,240
but this could also be in sport.

1804
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,200
This could be in school.

1805
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,080
This could be in music

1806
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,840
could be in anything creative endeavors

1807
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,160
but let's say you set out
a certain financial goal

1808
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,600
or let's say you wanna
get a certain number

1809
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,920
of followers on whatever
social media platform

1810
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,360
as you reach each one of those goals.

1811
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,120
You should know now that the amount

1812
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,720
of dopamine is not going to peak.

1813
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,920
It's actually going to diminish

1814
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,520
and make you crave more the
key to avoiding that crash

1815
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,680
but to still keep it in healthy levels

1816
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,800
that will allow you to continue.

1817
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,560
Your pursuit is as you are,
stair casing toward your goal.

1818
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,120
Maybe that's dollars,
maybe that's followers

1819
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,560
maybe that's grades

1820
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,840
maybe that's some other metric
it's metals or trophies.

1821
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,800
You actually want to
blunt the reward response

1822
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,480
for some of those intermediate goals.

1823
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,440
Now I'm not telling you
should celebrate your wins

1824
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,160
but I'm telling you not
to celebrate all of them.

1825
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,400
Whereas a good friend of mine who recently

1826
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,920
fortunately for him had a
great financial success.

1827
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,880
He asked me and somebody
else a good friend of mine.

1828
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
Who's very tuned into dopamine

1829
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,640
reward schedules understands how they work

1830
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,760
at a really deep level.

1831
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,680
And he said," I don't
know what to do next."

1832
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,680
And we said," Oh, well, that's simple,

1833
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,680
You should just give most of it away."

1834
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,600
And this wasn't a ploy to receive any

1835
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,800
of the money ourselves.

1836
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,080
This was really about reducing
the impact of that reward.

1837
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,320
Now hopefully giving them money away.

1838
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,520
If you already have enough

1839
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,840
of it would be something
that was rewarding

1840
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,120
in and of itself.

1841
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,720
But if you're a student who's
pursuing goals in university

1842
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,800
or you're an athlete, who's pursuing goals

1843
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,320
it actually makes sense
from a rational perspective.

1844
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,680
Once you understand these
mechanisms to hit a new high point

1845
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,040
of performance, or to get
that A-plus or a for you

1846
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,360
if it's an A-minus, et cetera

1847
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,760
and to tell yourself, okay, that was good.

1848
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,160
But to actually actively
blunt the reward to not go

1849
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,600
and celebrate too intensely,
because in doing that

1850
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,800
you keep your dopamine system
in check and you ensure

1851
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,680
that you're gonna stay on
the path of continued pursuit

1852
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,800
not just for that thing, but
for all things big increases

1853
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,880
in dopamine leads to big crashes

1854
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,480
in dopamine and big increases
in dopamine up the ante.

1855
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,920
They increase the extent
to which you are willing to

1856
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,240
invest time and energy
in order to achieve goals

1857
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,560
and rewards that may be out of your reach.

1858
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,880
You never really know if
you're going to succeed.

1859
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,880
So to make this crystal
clear, celebrate your wins

1860
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,640
but don't celebrate every win.

1861
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,080
That's one way that you can ensure

1862
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,800
that you're going to continue
down the path of progress.

1863
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,040
And I think most of the
learning tools that are

1864
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:11,360
in schools are about reward
for genuine performance.

1865
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,440
They are about encouraging us.

1866
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,840
We do have to believe
that we can perform well.

1867
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,600
One of the hallmarks of growth mindset is

1868
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,600
the internalization that we're
not getting it right yet.

1869
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,120
The word yet is very important.

1870
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,320
And also the sense that we reward

1871
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,760
our good behavior, our good
performance, but not every time.

1872
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,640
One way to do this is to
actually take the reward

1873
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,760
and reinforcement out of your
own hands and your own mind.

1874
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,280
And you tell somebody that
they are in control of

1875
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,440
whether or not you're allowed
to feel good about your wins.

1876
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,720
Now, I realize it's very
unnatural for most people

1877
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,920
but if you're somebody who
simply going to be in pursuit

1878
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,720
and you're going to really
register your wins, and you think

1879
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,040
that that's gonna actually
make you a better performer

1880
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,440
it will in the short term,
but not in the longterm.

1881
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,120
So you can lift the what Las Vegas

1882
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,040
and Atlantic city and
other gambling mechanisms

1883
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,480
and places have known for a long time.

1884
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,760
They lifted it from the scientists.

1885
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,960
You can now take it back and
you can start to leverage that.

1886
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,320
And you just make it intermittent.

1887
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,200
You reward yourself, not
on a predictable schedule

1888
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,440
so not every other time
or every third time

1889
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,200
or every 10th time, but
sometimes it's three

1890
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,760
in a row then not at all for 10 days.

1891
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,400
So reward is important.

1892
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,320
Self reward is critically important

1893
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,240
but make sure that you're not doing it

1894
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,600
on such a predictable
schedule that you burn

1895
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,600
out these dopamine circuits or

1896
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,680
that you undercut your own
ability to strive and achieve.

1897
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,640
Actually have a story from graduate school

1898
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,040
which I was forced

1899
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,120
into an intermittent
reinforcement schedule

1900
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,520
that I do believe has served me very well

1901
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,920
in my scientific career
and other aspects of life.

1902
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,360
My graduate advisor was
an amazing scientist.

1903
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,640
Unfortunately, she passed away

1904
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,600
but amazing scientists
and amazing human being

1905
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,840
with a very dry and somewhat
cruel sense of humor.

1906
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,520
Her name was Barbara Chapman,
and we published a paper

1907
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,560
in the journal, science and science nature

1908
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,960
and cell are considered the big three

1909
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,200
the most competitive
journals to publish in.

1910
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,760
And I had a first author paper in science.

1911
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,840
It was really exciting to me.

1912
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,200
I was a graduate student.

1913
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,040
I was very excited about the discovery.

1914
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,720
I was excited that it was in science.

1915
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,160
I was just thrilled.

1916
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,120
And I remember when the
paper finally got accepted

1917
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,400
because it had involved a ton

1918
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,280
of revisions and a lot of very hard work.

1919
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,520
And she came in and she
said," paper got accepted."

1920
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,800
I was super excited

1921
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,280
and she just kind of sat
there and nodded, and I said

1922
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,640
"are we gonna celebrate,
are we gonna have a party?"

1923
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,240
Or what, like, what are we gonna do it?

1924
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,520
And I'll never forget her answer.

1925
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,240
She said," I think we
should skip this one."

1926
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,600
And I thought she was joking.

1927
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,040
And I said," what do
you mean skip this one?"

1928
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,920
We're gonna publish the paper.

1929
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,360
He said, yeah, we're
gonna publish the paper.

1930
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,280
But she said, " maybe when
you get like four more

1931
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,080
maybe three, maybe two too."

1932
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,280
And I thought she was messing

1933
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,960
with me and she wasn't messing with me.

1934
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,440
And she was right.

1935
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,800
We never had a party.

1936
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,960
We had a celebration for that paper.

1937
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,320
I think she was really trying
to instill two ideas in me.

1938
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,440
One is that the work itself
was what was supposed to

1939
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,400
be most rewarding.

1940
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,240
That practice of experimentation

1941
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,000
a writing the paper, the experience

1942
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,240
of achieving something
they worked very hard at

1943
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,000
and that did indeed feel amazing.

1944
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,600
I actually can still feel it in my body.

1945
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,640
Now, the excitement.

1946
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,120
So there's a, still a dopamine release

1947
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,960
or that arc is going very long.

1948
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,960
This would be almost 20 years
ago now that this happened.

1949
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,400
So that's remarkable.

1950
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,560
The other one is that she's right.

1951
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,480
We never went out and celebrated

1952
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,240
and we did celebrate other wins

1953
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,640
other papers in the future
and things of that sort.

1954
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,880
But she was either consciously
or subconsciously putting me

1955
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,800
on an intermittent reward schedule.

1956
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,080
And to this day when
something really good happens

1957
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,720
I actually hesitate as
to whether or not I wanna

1958
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,440
internalize that and
celebrate whether I wanna

1959
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,680
tell anybody which is its
own form of celebration

1960
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,840
because then you're
getting positive feedback.

1961
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,520
And so I'm very cautious

1962
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,360
with how I deploy dopamine
release in response to wins.

1963
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,960
It's certainly not the only way that I've

1964
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,000
navigated my career.

1965
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,960
There are a number of other
principles I incorporate

1966
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,720
but intermittent reward for wins

1967
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,560
for achievements is a very
powerful way to ensure

1968
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,480
that you will stay on the path of pursuit.

1969
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,480
At this point in the podcast

1970
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,320
I'd like to take a moment
to address some corrections.

1971
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,400
I made some errors in previous episodes.

1972
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,600
They weren't major errors

1973
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,600
but a couple of you pointed them out

1974
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,400
and it's important to me
that we strive for accuracy.

1975
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,240
So the first one was I
talked in a previous episode

1976
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,840
about the potential benefits
for some people, not all

1977
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,600
of ashwagandha and its
role in blunting cortisol

1978
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,160
and a way of offsetting medium term,

1979
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,000
and some long-term stress.

1980
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,240
It's a supplement that
I've benefited from.

1981
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,600
It works through the GABA system

1982
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,600
and some other systems, someone pointed

1983
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,880
out a study that admittedly
was done in rats.

1984
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,480
I point I was focusing mainly

1985
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,640
on studies in humans during
the episode, but they point

1986
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,280
out a study that was
done in rats that showed

1987
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,600
that long-term
administration of ashwagandha

1988
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,560
could actually create some
negative effects mainly

1989
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,840
on the fibroid and perhaps
even the cortisol system

1990
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,080
maybe the melatonin system.

1991
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,320
I just wanna acknowledge that study.

1992
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,800
I'll reference it in the caption again

1993
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,760
that was a rat study.

1994
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,120
I was focused on human studies.

1995
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,880
Please go to examine.com.

1996
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,520
Put in ashwagandha will
tell you the various effects

1997
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,520
on different aspects of brain and body.

1998
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,360
It will also link to the pub med articles

1999
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,640
that are relevant there

2000
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,160
it is called the human effect matrix

2001
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,840
'cause that's only focused on humans.

2002
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,680
That's one of the reasons
I like examined.com

2003
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,840
as it's focused on human studies, again

2004
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,200
a wonderful free resource,
but I do appreciate

2005
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,800
that you pointed out that study

2006
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,440
because I do want people
to be aware of the range

2007
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:58,000
of effects that these various
compounds can have as well.

2008
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,760
A couple of times in previous episodes

2009
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,880
I said five HTP and not five HT five

2010
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,760
HT is serotonin five

2011
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,520
HTP is a precursor to a serotonin.

2012
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,120
I was talking about supplements

2013
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,680
and compounds that can stimulate
the release of serotonin.

2014
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,240
In the previous episode,
I was actually referring

2015
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,440
to it in a context

2016
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,480
for which I don't personally
like to take five HTP.

2017
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,680
That's just my own bias

2018
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,320
for reasons I described in that episode.

2019
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,280
But if you heard me say five HTP

2020
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,120
when I meant to say five HT, I apologize.

2021
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,120
And then last, I just
wanna point out again

2022
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,240
something that I
mentioned at the beginning

2023
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,760
which is that the Huberman
Lab Podcast is now subtitled

2024
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,920
in Spanish episodes one and two

2025
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,840
as well as our welcome
video are in Spanish.

2026
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,560
The other ones will be subtitled soon.

2027
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,960
You can expect that within
the next couple of weeks.

2028
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,320
So if you know Spanish speaking

2029
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,520
people who prefer to
digest the information

2030
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,400
in Spanish or that's,

2031
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,000
you can look forward to
the Spanish subtitles.

2032
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,280
You need to activate those

2033
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,160
in the caption feature on YouTube.

2034
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,880
Unfortunately, we don't
have Spanish dubbing

2035
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,120
over on the audio platforms.

2036
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,960
I realized once again, we've
covered a lot of material.

2037
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,600
Hopefully you now know far more

2038
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,960
about the dopamine system
reward and motivation

2039
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,040
than you did at the
beginning of this podcast.

2040
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,400
Hopefully you also
understand the other side

2041
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,400
of dopamine and reward, which is pain

2042
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,440
and the balance of this
pleasure pain system, as well

2043
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,800
as the molecules that we
call or that were described

2044
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,280
in the molecule of more book, I should say

2045
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,640
as the here and now molecules

2046
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,120
things like serotonin
and the endocannabinoids.

2047
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,720
We talked about a variety
of supplement based tools,

2048
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,640
things like vitamin B6 and zinc

2049
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,120
as they relate to prolactin P-E-A

2050
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,360
Very interesting compound again

2051
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,200
I've never tried it very interesting

2052
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,160
definitely in use out there L-DOPA MuCuna

2053
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,280
appearings talked about
caffeine, talked about nicotine.

2054
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,120
Talk about how some of the effects

2055
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,680
of Adderall can be
created purely cognitively

2056
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,000
without actually
ingesting Adderall, simply

2057
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,920
by telling people they're
ingesting Adderall

2058
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,880
giving them caffeine.

2059
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,360
Very interesting study that I referenced a

2060
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,080
little bit earlier,

2061
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,160
and we talked about scheduling dopamine

2062
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:16,160
adopting the intermittent
reward schedule for yourself

2063
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,960
in order to ensure long-term engagement

2064
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,680
with pursuits that I
hope are healthy pursuits

2065
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,120
and ones that serve you well

2066
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,120
this was by no means
an exhaustive coverage

2067
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,120
of all things, dopamine and motivation.

2068
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,360
It was by no means.

2069
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,560
The only time that we're gonna talk

2070
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,600
about dopamine and
motivation, next episode

2071
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,640
we're gonna continue to talk

2072
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,000
about emotions from
yet another perspective

2073
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
but hopefully you have enough now to think

2074
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,600
about in the meantime, and
that you can consider adopting

2075
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,960
in your own life and practices as always.

2076
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,280
I really wanna thank you
for your time and attention.

2077
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,400
If you learned something useful
today, please pass it along.

2078
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,520
One of the things that we teach

2079
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,920
in science that I think
is really wonderful

2080
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,480
to adopt in general in life is this idea

2081
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,800
of watch one, do one, teach one.

2082
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,960
This is what we tell graduate
students and med students

2083
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,400
and post-docs watch somebody
do something, learn it

2084
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,680
then do it, apply it, see

2085
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,160
if it works for you and then teach it.

2086
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,240
So it's usually not watch
one, do one, teach one.

2087
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,760
It's usually watch one

2088
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,640
do 20 teach as many people
as you possibly want.

2089
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,000
I'm not looking for attribution.

2090
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,280
These are tools that are grounded

2091
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,160
in neuroscience for which
I can't claim attribution.

2092
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,840
I'm just passing them along so

2093
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,800
that you can adopt them if
you like and pass them along.

2094
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,000
If you think people can benefit

2095
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,800
from them, many of you
have continued to ask how

2096
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,960
you can help support the
Huberman Lab Podcast.

2097
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,720
If you like what we're doing here.

2098
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,320
And you like the information
that we're sharing

2099
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,120
please click subscribe
on the YouTube channel.

2100
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,200
That really helps us as well.

2101
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,000
If you wanna hit the
notifications button, that

2102
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,040
will allow you to make sure
you don't miss any episodes.

2103
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,280
Typically we release episodes every Monday

2104
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,800
but in the future

2105
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,200
we may release episodes
as well as short clips.

2106
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,840
More often than that as well

2107
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,440
If you want to subscribe
on Apple or Spotify or both

2108
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,880
that's a great help to us.

2109
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,360
And on Apple, you have the
opportunity to leave us

2110
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,120
up to a five star review.

2111
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,680
We do use the comment
section here on YouTube to

2112
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,640
inform future content and
to address any questions

2113
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,720
and clear up any miss communications

2114
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,800
or misconceptions that might arise.

2115
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,280
So please put your
questions, your comments

2116
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,040
and your suggestions for future content.

2117
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,960
In the comment section below.

2118
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,560
The other way to support us is to check

2119
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,080
out our sponsors that were mentioned

2120
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,760
at the beginning of the podcast.

2121
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,840
The links to those sponsors
are in the captions.

2122
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,720
As well we've set up a Patreon account

2123
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,240
which is patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2124
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,080
That allows you to support the podcast

2125
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,040
at any level that you like as well.

2126
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,320
Because we mentioned supplements

2127
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,840
from time to time throughout the podcast

2128
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,320
and people always ask about what brands

2129
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,000
and sources we use or suggest
for those supplements.

2130
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,200
We partnered with Thorne

2131
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,760
T-H-O-R-N-E Thorne
supplements are known to be

2132
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,680
among the most stringent supplements

2133
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,760
in terms of the specificity of what's

2134
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,680
in the bottle matches what's on the label.

2135
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,240
The quality of the ingredients
is exceedingly high

2136
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:07,920
the Mayo Clinic

2137
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,320
and all the major sports
organizations are partnered

2138
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,960
with Thorne because of that stringency

2139
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,040
and that commitment to rigor.

2140
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,320
If you'd like to see the supplements

2141
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,520
that I personally take

2142
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,920
as well as get 20% off any

2143
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,160

Thorne makes you can go

for your time and attention today.

2153
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,120
I hope you learned a lot
and that you learned a lot

2154
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,360
of possible tools that
you could incorporate

2155
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,960
into your life as it relates
to motivation and emotion.

2156
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:01,760
Thank you for your interest in science.

2157
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,300
