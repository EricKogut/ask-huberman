1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,900
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,890
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,719
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,240
[upbeat rock music]

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,230
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,050
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,970
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,610
Today we are going to be
discussing bipolar disorder,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,130
often called bipolar depression.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,410
Bipolar depression is a condition

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,870
in which people undergo massive shifts

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,320
in their energy, their
perception, and their mood.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,940
However, it is very important to note

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,610
that these shifts in mood,
energy, and perception

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,350
are all maladaptive.

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,210
They can often cause tremendous damage

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,030
to the person suffering
from bipolar disorder

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,270
and tremendous damage to
the people in their lives.

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,610
Today we are going to parse the biology

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,180
that leads to these shifts in
mood, energy, and perception.

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,560
And we are going to talk

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,570
about the various treatments that exist.

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,830
Some of those treatments have been around

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,240
for a very long time,

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,520
and indeed one of those
treatments, lithium,

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,390
has an incredible backstory
about its discovery

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,970
and in understanding how lithium works

28
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,820
and some of the ways in
which it does not work well,

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,320
it reveals a tremendous amount

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,500
about how the brain works
normally in all individuals.

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,450
So that's a miraculous
story that I look forward

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,920
to sharing with you.

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,010
As we go forward in this
discussion about bipolar disorder,

34
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,060
I want everyone to keep in mind

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,370
that it is a very severe condition.

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,740
In fact, people suffering
from bipolar disorder

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,700
are at 20 to 30 times
greater risk of suicide.

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,860
So today is a serious discussion

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,720
and it's certainly one in which people

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,790
who are suffering from
manic bipolar disorder

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,200
or who know people that are suffering

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,170
from manic bipolar
disorder can benefit from.

43
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,540
However, for those of you
that might know people

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,020
or who themselves suffer
from major depression,

45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,670
we will also be talking about important

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,860
treatment developments
for major depression.

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,340
Major depression is a very
common thing for many people.

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,160
In fact, most people will
suffer from depression

49
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,560
of some sort at some point in their life,

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,140
although not necessarily a
major depressive episode,

51
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,990
and yet major depression is very common.

52
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,880
So you'll soon learn up to 20% of people

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,920
will suffer from major depression.

54
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,957
So today's discussion will
encompass all of that.

55
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:10,229
And it will also encompass
basic brain mechanisms

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,750
of neuroplasticity, the
brain's ability to change

57
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,320
in response to experience
both for good and for worse.

58
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,500
And you'll learn a lot
about the basic biology

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,280
of how the brain regulates
mood, energy, and perception.

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm pleased to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast

61
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,450
is now partnered with
Momentous Supplements.

62
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,940
We often talk about supplements
on the Huberman Lab Podcast

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,160
and while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,290
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

65
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,110
for things like enhancing
the quality and speed

66
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,640
with which you get into sleep,

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,670
or for enhancing focus
or for hormone support.

68
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,470
The reason we partnered
with Momentous Supplements

69
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,303
is several fold.

70
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:45,300
First of all, their supplements

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,040
are of the absolute highest quality.

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,320
Second of all, they ship internationally

73
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,810
which is important because
many of our podcast listeners

74
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,430
reside outside the US.

75
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,250
Third, many of the supplements
that Momentous makes

76
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,810
and most all of the supplements

77
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,640
that we partnered with them directly on

78
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,770
are single ingredient formulations.

79
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,270
This is important for a number of reasons.

80
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,590
First of all, if you're going to create

81
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,350
a supplement protocol that's
customized for your needs,

82
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,720
you want to be able to figure
out which supplement ingredients

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,700
are most essential and only use those

84
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,740
and supplements that
combine lots of ingredients

85
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,270
simply won't allow you to do that.

86
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,440
If you'd like to see the supplements

87
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,180
that we partnered with Momentous on,

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,150
you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,

89
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,280
and there you'll see
many of the supplements

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
that we've talked repeatedly about

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,970
on the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.

92
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,430
I should mention that the
catalog of supplements

93
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,100
that are available at
livemomentous.com/Huberman

94
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,840
is constantly being expanded

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
So you can check back there,
livemomentous.com/huberman

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,970
to see what's currently available.

97
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,590
And from time to time, you'll notice

98
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,780
new supplements being
added to the inventory.

99
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,100
Before we dive into the discussion

100
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,270
about manic bipolar disorder,

101
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,890
I want to highlight some recent findings

102
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,770
in an area totally
separate from mental health

103
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,270
that I think are really
important for everyone

104
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,170
to know about.

105
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,180
This is a paper published
in the journal Cell,

106
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,280
which is a Cell Press
Journal, an excellent journal.

107
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,110
In fact, one of the three apex journals.

108
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,670
So for those of you that are curious,

109
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,760
papers published in the journal
Nature, Science and Cell

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,520
are considered the sort of Super Bowl,

111
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,400
Stanley Cup, and NBA
championships of publishing.

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,500
And this paper entitled,

113
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,270
an inter-organ neural circuit

114
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,010
for appetite suppression illustrates

115
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,019
a very important principle
that I think everyone

116
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,919
should know about,

117
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,430
and that's the principle of
so-called parallel pathways.

118
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,860
Parallel pathways, as the name suggests,

119
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
are pathways, they
could be neural pathways

120
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,900
or hormonal pathways or otherwise

121
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,390
that operate independently of one another

122
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,000
to accomplish a common goal.

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,740
And what this paper really shows

124
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,610
is that there's a set
of peptides in the body

125
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,650
and the peptide that
I'm referring to today

126
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,340
is called GLP-1, Glucagon-like peptide-1,

127
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,720
and some related peptides.

128
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,940
I've talked about these
on the podcast before

129
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,773
for two reasons.

130
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:52,470
First of all, I'm a big
proponent and consumer

131
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,119
of yerba mate.

132
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,640
Yerba mate is a tea that
can promote the release

133
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,980
of glucagon-like peptide-1.

134
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,620
And there are also new prescription drugs

135
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,940
that are now hitting the market.

136
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,040
And for which there are really
impressive clinical trials

137
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,930
for diabetes and obesity

138
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,160
that are essentially glucagon-like
peptide-1 stimulator,

139
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,450
so they stimulate the release of that,

140
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,270
or they are in fact, a synthetic version

141
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,920
of glucagon-like peptide-1.

142
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,110
what is glucagon-like peptide-1?

143
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,960
It is a peptide, which is
a small little protein,

144
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,110
that can dramatically suppress appetite.

145
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,450
So that's why these
drugs are being explored

146
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,300
and are showing quite impressive results

147
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,180
for things like treatment
of type 2 diabetes

148
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,450
and other forms of diabetes,
as well as obesity.

149
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,010
So they lead to weight loss.

150
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,960
Now in terms of the yerba mate stimulation

151
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,280
of glucagon-like peptide-1,

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,170
that's going to be a much lower amount

153
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,060
of glucagon-like peptide-1 that's released

154
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,760
from drinking yerba
mate as opposed to say,

155
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,100
taking a drug that stimulates GLP-1

156
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,530
or taking a drug that is GLP-1.

157
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,260
Nonetheless, should also point out

158
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,590
that yerba mate comes in a
bunch of different forms.

159
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,030
There is some concern about
certain smokey-flavored forms

160
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,280
of yerba mate being carcinogenic,

161
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,800
so that's why I avoid
those forms of yerba mate.

162
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
But for me, yerba mate is one

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,950
of the preferred sources of caffeine.

164
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,480
For me, I like the way it tastes.

165
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,430
It does provide that sort of caffeine kick

166
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,660
that I like to have early in the day

167
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,210
for focus and for work and for exercise.

168
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,940
And yet I actively avoid
the smoked varieties

169
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,920
of yerba mate because of the potential

170
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,280
carcinogenic effects of
the smoked varieties.

171
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,980
Glucagon-like peptide-1,
as I mentioned earlier,

172
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,750
can suppress appetite.

173
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,930
But what this paper shows is it does that

174
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,680
by at least two mechanisms
through parallel pathways.

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,310
What this paper shows is
that glucagon-like peptide-1

176
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,920
axon receptors in the body in a portion

177
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,530
of the nervous system called
the enteric nervous system,

178
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,950
E-N-T-E-R-I-C, enteric nervous system.

179
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,240
This is a component of your nervous system

180
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,830
that you don't really have control over,

181
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,230
it's autonomic or automatic.

182
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,300
GLP-1 binds to what are called

183
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,820
intestinofugal enteric neurons,

184
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,990
you don't need to know the name,

185
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,700
but those neurons do two things.

186
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,240
First of all, they cause
some gut distension,

187
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,370
so they actually make you feel full.

188
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,480
This is incredible, right?

189
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,880
A peptide, not actual physical food,

190
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,240
but a peptide that stimulates neurons

191
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,380
that cause changes in the
so-called mechanoreceptors

192
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,970
of the gut, of the enteric nervous system

193
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,590
and make people feel full.

194
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,540
So it can lead to actually mild,

195
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,090
or I suppose if levels
of GLP-1 are very high,

196
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,370
to major gut distension.

197
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,350
I think that the levels
of GLP-1 that would come

198
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,430
from drinking yerba mate

199
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,610
and hopefully from appropriate dosaging of

200
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,400
the synthetic forms of GLP-1
or drugs that stimulate

201
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,860
GLP-1 would cause mild,
not major, gut distension,

202
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,680
'cause major gut distension
would be uncomfortable.

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,050
So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut

204
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,360
to increase gut distension,

205
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,660
and by way of a pathway
that goes from the gut

206
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,180
up to the hypothalamus, this
little cluster of neurons

207
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,070
about the size of a marble that sits above

208
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,980
the roof of your mouth, is
also suppressing appetite

209
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,570
through brain mechanisms.

210
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,980
So this is really beautiful, right?

211
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,110
You have a peptide, a small little protein

212
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,060
that's released in the gut

213
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,500
and that release within the
gut causes gut distension,

214
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,700
which makes you feel full.

215
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,790
And by way of neural
stimulation of the hypothalamus

216
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,310
also activates neural
pathways within the brain

217
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,670
that trigger satiety, the feeling
of having had enough food.

218
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,760
So to me, GLP-1 is both
impressive and important.

219
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,593
Why?

220
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:26,760
Because this recent category of drugs

221
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,500
that's now hitting the market

222
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,039
seems to adjust obesity or can
help people with weight loss

223
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,779
in order to help their health.

224
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,390
And it's doing so by at
least two mechanisms.

225
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,450
One is within the brain, and
the other is within the gut

226
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,630
and communication through the
so-called gut brain access.

227
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,370
Because again, these enteric neurons

228
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,370
are communicating to the
brain, the hypothalamus,

229
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,284
by way of this, what's called

230
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:52,590
the
sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic
pathway,

231
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,690
you absolutely do not
need to know all of that.

232
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,523
That's a mouthful,

233
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,510
that's enough to make
your mouth feel distended.

234
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,450
But at the same time,
things like yerba mate,

235
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,310
and I'm sure there are other
compounds out there as well,

236
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,400
but certainly yerba mate can
stimulate the release of GLP-1.

237
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,510
So for those of you that are looking

238
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,340
for some mild appetite suppression

239
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,400
and want to accomplish that
while also ingesting caffeine,

240
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,380
yerba mate might be a
good option for that.

241
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,230
And just know that it's
operating through two mechanisms,

242
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,030
on the body through mild gut distension

243
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,900
to make you feel full,

244
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,730
and on the brain to increase satiety

245
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,230
and make you feel less hungry.

246
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,390
And then for everybody, not just those

247
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,430
that are interested in
appetite suppression,

248
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,440
I think it's important to understand

249
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,660
that these parallel
pathways are fundamental

250
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,130
to how we are organized.

251
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,480
Another good example of this would be

252
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
when we are excited by
something positive or negative,

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,520
so it could be stressful or
we are positively aroused,

254
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,850
there is a parallel activation
of epinephrine, adrenaline,

255
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,040
both from your adrenals and
from an area in the brain

256
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,480
called the locus coeruleus.

257
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,427
So again and again, we see this in biology

258
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:50,370
and in neuroscience that
your brain and your body

259
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,110
are acting in concert.

260
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,420
They're acting together through mechanisms

261
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,850
that either are independent,
so separately in the brain

262
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,140
and separately in the body,

263
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,660
but directed towards a common goal,

264
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,150
or through communication
between brain and body,

265
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,310
and almost always that communication

266
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,630
is going to be bidirectional,

267
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,580
body to brain and brain to body.

268
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,410
So I think these results
are really interesting

269
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,450
and really important
for sake of weight loss,

270
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,490
for sake of appetite suppression,

271
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,770
and just generally for the
way that they illustrate

272
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,420
this very important theme

273
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,220
of the way that we are constructed

274
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,190
at a biological level
which is parallel pathways.

275
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,990
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

276
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,910
that this podcast is
separate from my teaching

277
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,530
and research roles at Stanford.

278
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,600
It is however part of my desire and effort

279
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,490
to bring zero cost to consumer information

280
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,440
about science and science-related tools

281
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,760
to the general public.

282
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,500
In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank

283
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
the sponsors of today's podcast.

284
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,060
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

285
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,460
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

286
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,980
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

287
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,600
to help you better understand your body

288
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,610
and help you reach your health goals.

289
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,720
I've long been a believer

290
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,340
in getting regular blood work done

291
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,620
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

292
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,750
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

293
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,120
can only be assessed with
a quality blood test.

294
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,970
And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

295
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,860
you can also get insight
into, for instance,

296
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,450
what your biological age is

297
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,460
and compare that to
your chronological age.

298
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,960
And of course your biological age

299
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,030
is the one that's important
for your longevity

300
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,340
and your understanding of
your current health needs.

301
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,900
One major problem with most blood tests

302
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,940
and DNA tests out there however,

303
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,920
is that you get information
back about levels

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,440
of metabolic factors, levels
of hormones and lipids

305
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,120
and so forth, but you don't know exactly

306
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,860
what to do with that information.

307
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,600
InsideTracker solves that problem

308
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,310
through their personalized platform

309
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,780
which can tell you, for instance,

310
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,200
lifestyle factors like
fitness or nutrition

311
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,970
or supplementation that you can use

312
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,380
to bring the numbers into the ranges

313
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,240
that are ideal for your health needs.

314
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,650
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

318
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,140
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

319
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,970
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

320
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,770
that are of the absolute highest quality.

321
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,720
The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers

322
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,580
from Stanford and everything about ROKA

323
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,590
eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed

324
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,090
with performance in mind.

325
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,230
I've spent a lifetime working

326
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,730
on the biology of the visual system

327
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,230
and I can tell you that your visual system

328
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,810
has to contend with a number
of very important challenges

329
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,520
in order for you to see clearly.

330
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,500
The designers of ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses

331
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,700
understand this

332
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,100
and for that reason, ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses

333
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,660
allow you, for instance, to move

334
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,220
from a shady area to a bright area

335
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,900
or from a bright area to a shady area

336
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,330
and still see everything
with crystal clarity.

337
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,920
Originally, their glasses and sunglasses

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,510
were designed for performance,

339
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,010
that is for running and cycling,

340
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,380
and as a consequence, the
eyeglasses and sunglasses

341
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,880
stay on your face even if you get sweaty

342
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,140
and they're extremely lightweight.

343
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,790
In fact, most of the
time, I don't even realize

344
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,780
that they're on my face.

345
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,720
I wear ROKA eyeglasses for
reading and for driving at night

346
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,700
and I wear their sunglasses
when I'm out during the day

347
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,220
and it's really bright and
I need to use sunglasses

348
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,860
in order to be able to navigate
in that bright sunlight.

349
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,620
If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com,

00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,980
and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

354
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,210
Today's episode is also

355
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,799
brought to us by Blinkist.

356
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,260
Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of nonfiction books

357
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,540
condensed town to just 15 minutes each

358
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,390
of key takeaways that you
can read or listen to.

359
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,460
I'm a big believer in
reading physical books,

360
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,380
I actually own a lot of hard cover books

361
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,930
and paperback books and I
like holding them my hand

362
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,190
and flipping through the pages.

363
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,170
I also like listening to audiobooks.

364
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,290
But the reality is I don't have
a ton of time to read books

365
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,190
and I don't have a lot of time

366
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,080
to listen to entire audiobooks.

367
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,970
There are also a lot of books
that I've really enjoyed

368
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,100
in the past that I have
read in their entirety

369
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,390
but then I like to update myself

370
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,610
on the information on
every once in a while.

371
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,350
Blinkist has terrific books available.

372
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,340
For instance, I'm a big fan

373
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,470
of Tim Ferris's 4-Hour Body,

374
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,300
gleaned So much knowledge from that book.

375
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,060
Also from Nassim Taleb's
book, The Black Swan

376
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,850
and the great Matt Walker's
book, Why We Sleep,

377
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,320
which is a book that
I've read several times

378
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,540
and I actually listen to the synopsis of

379
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,250
on Blinkist over and over

380
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,170
because there's so many key takeaways.

396
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,110
Let's talk about bipolar disorder.

397
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,210
And today I'm going to
refer to bipolar disorder

398
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,330
interchangeably with bipolar depression,

399
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,310
although as you will soon learn,

400
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,350
not everyone with bipolar disorder

401
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,530
necessarily goes through highs and lows.

402
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,540
There is a subset of people who suffer

403
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,840
from bipolar disorder who
experience the manic phases,

404
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,930
the highly elevated mood and energy,

405
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,600
and then drop down to so-called baseline,

406
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,750
so they don't necessarily go
down into a depressive state.

407
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,420
They often will return to
a somewhat normal state.

408
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,630
In fact, we will talk about
the percentage of time

409
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,310
that people with bipolar disorder

410
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,820
tend to be symptom-free manic or depressed

411
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,440
in the context of the different categories

412
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,700
of bipolar disorder.

413
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,120
But as we wade into this topic
that is bipolar disorder,

414
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,050
I just want to give you a little bit

415
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,850
of the background statistics

416
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,880
to anchor us in just how
serious and prevalent

417
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,860
bipolar disorder is.

418
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,250
So bipolar disorder
impacts about 1% of people,

419
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,560
that might seem like a small percentage,

420
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,230
but if you think about a
room of a hundred people,

421
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,090
that means that at least one of them

422
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,690
is very likely to have bipolar disorder.

423
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,880
And as I mentioned earlier
in the introduction,

424
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,250
bipolar disorder is very serious.

425
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,720
It has a 20 to 30% greater
incidence of suicide

426
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,090
than the general population, which is,

427
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,740
first of all, extremely tragic

428
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,540
and extremely concerning.

429
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,540
So anyone that thinks they
might have bipolar disorder

430
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,250
or who knows someone with bipolar disorder

431
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,110
should be especially vigilant about this.

432
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,970
And we'll talk about some of the,

433
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,580
or signs and risk factors, age of onset,

434
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,740
et cetera, as we move forward.

435
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,110
So 1% of people have bipolar disorder.

436
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,170
The typical age of onset
is anywhere from 20

437
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,590
to 25 years old, although
it can be much earlier.

438
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,430
And the earlier the onset
of a bipolar episode,

439
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,140
which we will define in a few minutes,

440
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,660
the earlier the onset of that episode,

441
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,450
the higher likelihood
that the bipolar disorder

442
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,250
is going to be a stable feature

443
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,950
of that person's psychology going forward.

444
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,750
And yet, I also want to point out

445
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,120
that there are some very good treatments

446
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,560
for bipolar disorder that those people

447
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,810
could still benefit from.

448
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,930
There are basically two
kinds of bipolar disorder

449
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,960
referred to as bipolar 1 and bipolar 2.

450
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,750
So let's just talk about bipolar 1 first.

451
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,450
Bipolar 1 is characterized by

452
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,090
a fairly extended period of mania.

453
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,200
What is mania?

454
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,470
Mania is a period of very elevated mood,

455
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,320
energy, distractibility, impulsivity,

456
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,570
and some other symptomology
that we'll talk about

457
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,620
going forward.

458
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,640
But this manic episode is extreme.

459
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,510
This is a condition in
which the energy lift,

460
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,599
the mood lift, and the sort of impulsivity

461
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,729
and actions and words of the person

462
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,650
suffering from manic bipolar disorder

463
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,800
are very noticeable and very extreme.

464
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,150
Now a key thing, however,

465
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,950
is that it's not always noticeable

466
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,900
to the person suffering from it

467
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,430
that they are in this mode.

468
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,740
Sometimes they recognize
that, sometimes they don't,

469
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,920
but it's always highly
recognizable to other people

470
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,220
that the person suffering
from manic bipolar disorder

471
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,960
is not like other people.

472
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,470
So let's talk about bipolar
1 in a little bit more depth.

473
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,690
One of the key clinical criteria

474
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,090
or diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1

475
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,660
is that a person suffer
from these manic episodes

476
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,700
or display these manic episodes

477
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,590
for seven days or more.

478
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,700
That turns out to be very key.

479
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,980
The stability of that manic episode

480
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,880
for seven days or more turns
out to be very important.

481
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,890
And for those seven days,

482
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,840
the person is in an elevated mood,

483
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,400
expansive thought all day,
every day for those seven days.

484
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,510
Now there are a lot of reasons

485
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,240
why somebody could be in a manic mode.

486
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,680
It doesn't necessarily mean

487
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,720
that somebody has bipolar disorder.

488
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,820
In fact, someone could be in a manic mode

489
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,620
for seven days or more

490
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,900
and still not be diagnosed
with bipolar disorder.

491
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,733
Why?

492
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:20,640
Well, there are other things
that can create manic episodes,

493
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,820
things like traumatic brain
injury, things like seizure,

494
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,400
things like various prescription
drugs or illicit drugs,

495
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,560
things like amphetamine and cocaine,

496
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,810
that is not the same as bipolar disorder

497
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,050
even though from a
symptomology perspective,

498
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,060
they might look even identical.

499
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,320
So let's think about these symptoms

500
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,980
and the diagnostic criteria
that a psychiatrist would use

501
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,010
in order to ask whether
or not someone is manic

502
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,470
because they have manic
by bipolar disorder

503
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,420
or whether or not that person is manic

504
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,390
for some other reason, such
as traumatic brain injury,

505
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,640
illicit drugs, et cetera.

506
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,810
So typically a person would
be brought into a clinic

507
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,660
or a person would bring
themselves to a clinic

508
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,490
or meet with a psychiatrist,

509
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,530
it seems more likely that
they would be directed

510
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,240
toward a psychiatrist because oftentimes

511
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,130
people who are in a manic episode

512
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,320
just simply won't have the perspective

513
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,500
or the foresight to bring
themselves into the clinic.

514
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,200
And the psychiatrist is
going to start to evaluate

515
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,790
for a couple of different things.

516
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,250
But first of all, what they're
going to try and figure out

517
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,710
is whether or not the
person has at least three

518
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,723
of the following symptoms.

519
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,290
The first symptom is distractibility.

520
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,430
Is the person distractable?

521
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,930
Are they going from one thing to the next.

522
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,280
People who are in a manic episode

523
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,240
will be talking about a pen

524
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,160
and then they'll be talking
about something they saw

525
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,690
the other day and then
something they want to purchase

526
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,700
and then a place they're
going to travel to, et cetera,

527
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,790
but they are also very
prone to any stimulus

528
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,623
within the room.

529
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:44,310
Meaning a bell could go off

530
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,480
or there could be a
sound out in the hallway

531
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,470
and they'll orient to that.

532
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,790
And then they'll orient to the clinician

533
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,470
and then they'll orient to
something in their pocket,

534
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,790
so they're all over the place.

535
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,280
You could think of this
a little bit like ADHD

536
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,340
or attention-deficit disorder,
but it's very extreme.

537
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,840
So highly distractable,

538
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,650
highly impulsive, impulsivity
relates to actions.

539
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,630
So the person might be
fidgeting with something

540
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,220
and then they might try and leave the room

541
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,959
or the person might, if they
were out in the real world,

542
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,830
somebody might notice that the person

543
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,170
is going and purchasing

544
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,020
multiples of something that
would be unusual for someone

545
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,853
to purchase.

546
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:18,600
So for instance, I happen to know someone

547
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,060
whose ex-spouse had bipolar disorder

548
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,030
and their ex-spouse went out and bought

549
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,523
10 plus air fryers.

550
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,660
I mean, I think unless you're a restaurant

551
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,830
that's using a lot of air fryers,

552
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,480
the idea that you would need more than one

553
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,750
or two air fryers might
just seem a little bit

554
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,860
out of the norm.

555
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,980
And so that impulsivity can be purchasing,

556
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,960
it can be other things as well.

557
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,350
It can be booking 12 international
trips in one afternoon

558
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,480
or going and buying three cars, et cetera.

559
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,620
So impulsivity.

560
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,630
the other is grandiosity.

561
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,270
People who have manic bipolar disorder

562
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,720
who are in a manic
episode will often display

563
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,150
words of or actions of grandiosity.

564
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,700
And keep in mind, these are not lies

565
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,530
in the sense that the person isn't lying

566
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,110
in order to try and pull
one over on anybody,

567
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,960
these are actual beliefs
that the person comes to have

568
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,810
about their grandiose
position in the world

569
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,200
or grandiose opportunities
or potential in the world.

570
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,110
Typical forms of grandiosity
and manic episodes

571
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,090
would be that the person suddenly decides

572
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,070
that they are going to
win a Pulitzer Prize.

573
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,170
They are the person selected
to win a Pulitzer Prize.

574
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,180
They're going to write
a novel that afternoon,

575
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,310
and they're going to win a
Pulitzer Prize that year,

576
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,460
which is more or less
a delusion of grandeur.

577
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,350
The idea that someone could
do that in one afternoon,

578
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,220
I suppose it is possible in
the realm of all possibilities,

579
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,710
but it's extremely unlikely.

580
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,100
Other forms of grandiosity
that often present themselves

581
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,440
in people suffering from a manic episode

582
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,450
will be that they're
going to run for president

583
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,260
or that they are the
person that they believe

584
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,490
is selected by the
citizens of a given country

585
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,000
or by the universe to be the
president of that country

586
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,770
or to be present of the universe.

587
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,350
It sounds ridiculous, but
those sorts of delusions

588
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,180
of grandiosity are one condition

589
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,710
that often presents itself,

590
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,740
or one set of symptoms
that presents itself.

591
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,130
Flight of ideas are also
typical of manic episodes.

592
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,020
So this is a little bit
like distractibility,

593
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,360
but this would be people
talking extensively

594
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,920
about one thing and then switching

595
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,660
and talking extensively
about something else.

596
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,460
It would be as if I was doing this podcast

597
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,780
talking about manic bipolar disorder

598
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,670
and then suddenly switching to OCD

599
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,200
and then to deliberate cold exposure

600
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,060
and then to the role of sugar

601
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,470
and its impact on the brain, et cetera.

602
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,560
So essentially a random selection

603
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,800
of the different topics
that exist in science,

604
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,510
all of which I happen
to be very interested in

605
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,590
and curious about,

606
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,920
but just as we have
episodes of the podcast

607
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,570
that are about one or two topics,

608
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,090
and we focus on those in
a fairly narrow trench

609
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,260
of discussion,

610
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,450
somebody who has a flight of ideas

611
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,960
would be jumping between
categories and topics

612
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,580
in a kind of pseudo random way.

613
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,710
So they might take off
down a path of one thing

614
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,320
and then switch to another
without any transition

615
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,970
or with transitions that that don't have

616
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,980
any logical structure to them.

617
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,070
The other aspect of manic bipolar disorder

618
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,170
that often presents itself
in the manic episodes

619
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,070
are agitation.

620
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,050
People feeling extremely
physically agitated,

621
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,240
so a lot of shaking and moving about.

622
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,580
This can venture into
the realm of paranoia,

623
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,140
but a lot of agitation,

624
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,230
a difficulty sitting down and being still,

625
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,230
a difficulty in just looking,
feeling and acting calm.

626
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,020
And then another condition is no sleep.

627
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,840
And when I say no sleep, I mean no sleep

628
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,970
or very minimal sleep.

629
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,220
As incredible as it sounds,

630
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,930
people who are in a manic episode

631
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,890
can often go seven days
or more with zero sleep.

632
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,020
And a key feature of this zero sleep

633
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,250
is that they're not troubled by it.

634
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,500
They're not thinking, oh,
I'm suffering from insomnia

635
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,730
and I really, really want to sleep.

636
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,340
Sometimes that's the case,
but more often than not,

637
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,930
they are simply not sleeping.

638
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,620
They're staying up 24 hours
then another 24 hours,

639
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,940
it just continues for an entire week.

640
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,010
Again, inconceivable to those of us

641
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,910
that don't suffer from manic episodes.

642
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,950
I can only imagine how pulled
apart most of us would feel

643
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,680
under those conditions,
and yet they are just going

644
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,630
and going and going with no sleep,

645
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,630
up all hours, shopping, talking, running,

646
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,950
doing all sorts of different
things in the categories

647
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,170
of other symptoms that
we talked about before.

648
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,230
And it doesn't bother them
that they're not sleeping.

649
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,620
And then the last sort
of category of symptoms

650
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,810
that the psychiatrist is evaluating for

651
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,560
and seeing if they present
is rapid pressured speech.

652
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,450
The rapid pressured speech is something

653
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,220
that when you hear it, you recognize it.

654
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,110
This is somebody that almost
seems to be hitting you

655
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,660
with speech like machine gun fire,

656
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,610
it's coming at you, coming
at you, coming at you

657
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,830
and there's really no
room for conversation.

658
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,870
They're not offering any opportunity

659
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,820
for a back and forth, or if
there is a back and forth,

660
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,170
they might ask you how
you feel about something

661
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,239
and then you started, well, I,

662
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,229
[speaking gibberish]

663
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:52,860
then they're going to hit
you with another barrage

664
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,680
or a paragraph of information

665
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,080
or of just speech, that pseudo random.

666
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,300
So we've got distractibility, impulsivity,

667
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,940
grandiosity, flight of ideas, agitation,

668
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,240
no sleep, and rapid pressured speech.

669
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,120
For someone to be diagnosed
as in a manic episode,

670
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,970
they do not have to be engaging in

671
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,300
or displaying all of those symptoms.

672
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,640
They do however need to present

673
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,590
at least three of those symptoms,

674
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,070
and then in order to meet
the condition of bipolar 1,

675
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,260
they have to be presenting
those three symptoms

676
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,780
for at least seven days.

677
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,900
It could be longer, but
at least seven days.

678
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,200
Now, this seems pretty
straightforward, right?

679
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,417
At one level, the way that I describe this

680
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:38,460
and the way that it exists
in the clinical literature,

681
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,390
you could think, well,

682
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,310
this should be pretty easy to diagnose.

683
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,890
And yet there's a complication there

684
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,630
or a challenge there because
the psychiatrist, again,

685
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,210
has to determine that these manic episodes

686
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:53,210
are not due to something
other than bipolar disorder.

687
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,440
For instance, again, it could be TBI,

688
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,180
traumatic brain injury,
it could be seizures,

689
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,920
or meds or other sorts of drugs.

690
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,870
Corticosteroids, which
are often prescribed

691
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,630
for a number of immune
conditions or for wound healing

692
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,760
can also cause manic episodes.

693
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,340
So they have to determine that everything

694
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,950
that's happening meets the
criteria I described before,

695
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,020
three out of seven of
these symptom categories

696
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,400
for seven days or more

697
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,560
and that it can't be better explained

698
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,200
by something else going
on in that person's life

699
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,330
or immediate medical history.

700
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,500
That's very important.

701
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,580
Now, the other challenge,

702
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,870
and this is something
that's going to come up

703
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,240
again and again today, not
just in the description

704
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,280
of the biology of bipolar disorder,

705
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,190
but also the description
of different treatments

706
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,570
and treatment approaches,

707
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,990
is that typically, when
somebody is sitting

708
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,210
in front of a psychiatrist,

709
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,760
in particular for the first time

710
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,010
those two people are interacting,

711
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,890
the psychiatrist is just
getting one snapshot

712
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,990
of the person at that moment.

713
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,170
So the person could be on
day one of a manic episode,

714
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,690
the person might be on day
six of a manic episode,

715
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,660
the person could be transitioning
out of a manic episode,

716
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,570
or the person could be
suffering from a combination

717
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,340
of manic episode where,

718
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,620
because of the impulsivity
of bipolar disorder,

719
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,030
they went out and used illicit drugs.

720
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,680
They also used cocaine.

721
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,860
So the psychiatrist has
a serious challenge.

722
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,100
The psychiatrist has to determine
based on a conversation,

723
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,870
this isn't a blood test,

724
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,270
this isn't a measurement
that you can take on a scale

725
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,120
or with a biomarker, they
have to use language,

726
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,700
a conversation with somebody
who, by all accounts,

727
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,710
is pretty impaired at conversation

728
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,330
to determine whether or not

729
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,850
they're suffering from a manic episode

730
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,360
that is the consequence
of bipolar disorder.

731
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,830
You can imagine this in the real world,

732
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,690
as somebody says, well,
how long has it been

733
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,523
since you slept?

734
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,360
And the person starts to answer,

735
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,850
oh, well, the other day I
went down to the basement.

736
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,990
I was going to get something out of

737
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,850
the refrigerator and I
thought I might take a nap.

738
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,683
And then all of a sudden they're talking

739
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:46,710
about something completely different.

740
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,870
So they might not even have an answer.

741
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,010
So the psychiatrist has to
be a really good detective,

742
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,090
a benevolent detective,

743
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,040
but a detective nonetheless

744
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,150
in determining whether or not

745
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,190
these symptoms have existed
for seven days or more,

746
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,530
and whether or not they
meet the, at least three,

747
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,640
it could be more, but at least three

748
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,860
of the criteria of symptom categories

749
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,270
I talked about before.

750
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,220
Now, assuming that they do,

751
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,740
assuming that the patient
meets those criteria,

752
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,100
they are likely to be
diagnosed with bipolar 1.

753
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,890
Now bipolar 1 disorder

754
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,660
means they're having these
extended manic episodes,

755
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,830
seven days or more,

756
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,990
but it does not necessarily mean

757
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,830
that they are dropping into
a depressive episode as well.

758
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,770
This is a common misconception
about bipolar disorder

759
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,720
because as it's often called,

760
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,260
bipolar disorder is referred
to as bipolar depression,

761
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,840
and yet many people with bipolar disorder

762
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,990
don't necessarily experience
the deep depressive episodes.

763
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,480
Many of them do, but many of them do not.

764
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,230
So somebody can truly
be diagnosed accurately

765
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,270
with bipolar one,

766
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,610
even though they're only
experiencing manic episodes

767
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,200
and then dropping down to baseline.

768
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,330
Manic episode, then
dropping down to baseline.

769
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,850
That's very important to understand.

770
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,630
Now, the second category of
bipolar disorder is bipolar 2.

771
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,350
So BP-II or bipolar disorder
2 is somewhat different

772
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,550
than bipolar disorder 1.

773
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,580
First of all, it's
characterized most often

774
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,790
by the presence of both
manic episodes, mania,

775
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,290
and depressive episodes,

776
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,840
or what's referred to as hypomania.

777
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,950
Now, anytime in biology or
in medicine you hear hypo,

778
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,990
it's the opposite of hyper.

779
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,180
So we've got normal hyper and hypo.

780
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,720
Hypomania is a somewhat
suppressed level of mania.

781
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
So this is not going to be as extreme

782
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,980
as the mania that we typically think of.

783
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,090
And yet the hypo can
be due to the duration,

784
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,370
not the intensity of mania.

785
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,203
That's right.

786
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:42,990
Hypomania can mean a
lessened intensity of mania,

787
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,330
but it can also be used to refer to

788
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,767
a shorter duration of mania.

789
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,290
And in fact, that's
one of the key criteria

790
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,430
for bipolar 2.

791
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,170
Bipolar 2 is often diagnosed

792
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,900
on the basis of the
presence of manic episodes

793
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,710
that are lasting four days or even less.

794
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,080
So someone with BP-II might have four days

795
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,630
of this increased energy,
goal-directed activity,

796
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,070
they're irritable, they're euphoric,

797
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,630
they're not sleeping, et cetera,

798
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,120
but it's only lasting for about four days.

799
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,510
Or they could be having longer
extended periods of mania,

800
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,240
but they are hypomanic episodes.

801
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,560
They're not quite as intense

802
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,470
so the pressured speech
isn't quite as pressured.

803
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,690
The impulsivity isn't quite as severe,

804
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,770
et cetera, et cetera.

805
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,060
The other aspect of bipolar 2

806
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,490
is one that I had mentioned
briefly a moment ago,

807
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,980
which is that it's often associated

808
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,440
with the drops into
the depressive episode.

809
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,540
So people are going from manic episodes

810
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,860
for four days or less,

811
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,990
then they're dropping into a depression,

812
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,633
going back to normal, manic again.

813
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,850
I do want to point out however

814
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,610
that people who have
bipolar 1 can indeed go

815
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,530
from manic episodes to severe,

816
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,730
what we call major depression,

817
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,040
so they can oscillate like a sine wave,

818
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,203
really high highs, really low lows.

819
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,860
And very important to understand

820
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,700
in terms of understanding
both bipolar 1 and bipolar 2

821
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,710
is that it's not always a sine wave.

822
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,670
This is really important

823
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,220
and it's something that
frankly I did not know

824
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,810
until I started researching this episode

825
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,400
and talking to some psychiatrists.

826
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,720
I should mention, I've talked to several

827
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,640
board certified
psychiatrists in preparation

828
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,810
for this episode,

829
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,280
I'll give some references to them.

830
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,660
And in fact, some of them
are going to be coming

831
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,520
on the podcast as guests in the future

832
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,410
for more in-depth discussion about bipolar

833
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,630
and other psychiatric disorders.

834
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,810
But all the psychiatrists
I spoke to confirmed

835
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,300
what the other was saying, which was that

836
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,340
the way that bipolar disorder can present

837
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,040
can vary tremendously between individuals.

838
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,140
One person might go from very high highs

839
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,130
that last seven days or more,

840
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,150
to very low lows.

841
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,283
Bouts of depression, major depression

842
00:31:38,283 --> 00:31:40,620
that can last two weeks or more.

843
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,990
Other people are rapid cycling by way

844
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,060
of three days manic, three days normal,

845
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,560
three days manic, and then dropping

846
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,030
into three days depression.

847
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,490
So you want to erase
that picture in your mind

848
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,490
that manic bipolar
disorder is this sine wave,

849
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,460
this cycling up and down
between mania and depression.

850
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,920
It can take a lot of different forms.

851
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,160
And again, this is a serious challenge

852
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,880
for the psychiatrist to
diagnose people because of that

853
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,800
fact that they're only getting a snapshot

854
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,810
of the person unless they've
known them for some time

855
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,670
and are working with them for some time.

856
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,830
But this is also especially important

857
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,450
for those of you that

858
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,990
either have bipolar depression
or suspect that you might,

859
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,650
or that know someone
with bipolar depression

860
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,130
or suspect somebody might
have bipolar depression,

861
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,900
AKA bipolar disorder.

862
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,940
Because if you're noticing that somebody

863
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,030
is very manic and then normal, well,

864
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,230
that's a very different picture

865
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,060
than somebody who's going from very manic

866
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,550
to very deep bouts of depression.

867
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,770
The very manic to deep bouts of depression

868
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,710
is easier to recognize
because of the extremes

869
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,760
of those highs and lows.

870
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,320
Now, this might seem somewhat obvious

871
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,910
to all of you as I describe it,

872
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,120
and yet it's very important as a, frankly,

873
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,650
a citizen of the planet

874
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,270
who knows other human beings

875
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,340
to keep an eye out for
these manic episodes,

876
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,010
because again, whether or
not it's four days or less,

877
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,440
or whether or not it's seven days or more,

878
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,040
these manic episodes really
are the defining criteria

879
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,010
of bipolar disorder,
AKA bipolar depression.

880
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,620
There are a couple other key features

881
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,750
about bipolar 1 and bipolar 2

882
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,550
that can allow us to get better insight

883
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,280
into whether or not somebody
has bipolar 1 or bipolar 2,

884
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,440
and that's the percentage of time

885
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,100
that people with bipolar
1 versus bipolar 2 spend

886
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,990
in a manic state, a depressed state,

887
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,640
or a symptom-free state.

888
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
And this is also important to discuss

889
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,180
because it turns out that people

890
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,180
with genuine diagnosed bipolar 1

891
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,450
or bipolar 2 are often symptom-free,

892
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,640
which again can make it difficult

893
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,770
for us as people that know them

894
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,410
or for people that are treating people

895
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,710
with bipolar disorder to
identify whether or not

896
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,720
somebody is in a manic episode

897
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,553
or a depressive episode,

898
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,570
or whether or not they
are headed into a manic

899
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,950
or depressive episode.

900
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,680
So the numbers on this have been studied.

901
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,690
This from a paper, actually two papers,

902
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,120
first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al.

903
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,100
published some years ago, 20 years ago,

904
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,350
but the data hold up
really nicely over time.

905
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,280
These were both published

906
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,860
in Journal American Medical
Association Psychiatry.

907
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,350
So JAMA Psychiatry is a superb journal.

908
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,920
And basically people who
have bipolar 1 on average

909
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,179
spend about 50%, it's
actually 53% was the number

910
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,429
that was eventually converged upon,

911
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,859
but about 50% of their time symptom-free.

912
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,760
That's interesting, right?

913
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,150
Somebody who has genuine
bipolar 1 disorder

914
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,219
can spend as much as half of their life

915
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,749
symptom-free, sleeping normally,

916
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,400
speaking normally, et cetera.

917
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,480
About 32% of the time depressed,

918
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,520
And when we say depressed,
we mean major depression.

919
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,429
So severe challenges with waking up

920
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,019
at two or three in the morning,

921
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,550
and having trouble falling back asleep.

922
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,530
That's one of the defining
characteristics of depression,

923
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,760
or sleeping far too much,

924
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,290
having a hard time getting
out of bed in the morning,

925
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,000
suppressed appetite, suppressed libido,

926
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,650
suppressed motivation,

927
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,449
all the general symptoms
of major depression

928
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,189
which we'll talk about
a little bit more later

929
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,950
and in an upcoming episode
about major depression

930
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,783
in particular.

931
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:01,920
And then about 15% of their time

932
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,830
in this kind of manic
state or mixed manic state,

933
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,200
where they are showing

934
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,120
long, again, seven days or more bouts

935
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,680
of sleeplessness, irritability,

936
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,813
pressured speech, grandiosity, et cetera.

937
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,740
Contrast that with people
who have bipolar 2 disorder

938
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,980
who are spending about half of their time

939
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,780
in a depressed state.

940
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,450
So that's interesting, people
with bipolar 2 disorder,

941
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,330
while not always
displaying depressed states

942
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,970
or oscillations between mania or hypomania

943
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,140
and depressed states,

944
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,660
they tend to be in the
depressed state more often.

945
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,980
And again, this is major depression.

946
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,450
This isn't just a little bit of a low,

947
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,300
this is a serious depression
of their nervous system,

948
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,700
their mood, and as we say, their affect,

949
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,840
their outlook on life,

950
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,210
and that's one of the key
distinguishing features

951
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,570
of major depression is that
people's outlook on life

952
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,910
becomes very diminished in the sense

953
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,140
that they don't see a future.

954
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,570
You ask them about, how's work going?

955
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,403
How're your relationships?

956
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,290
And it's not just that they
feel that that's going poorly,

957
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,240
they really feel as if
there's no opportunity

958
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,713
for those things to improve.

959
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,770
Those people with bipolar 2

960
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,530
tend to be symptom-free
about 45% of the time.

961
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,360
Again, these are averages,

962
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,370
so about 45% of the time,

963
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,350
that's a considerable amount of the time.

964
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,810
And they tend to be in
these hypomanic states

965
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,240
only about 4 or 5% of the time.

966
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,760
Again, the criteria for BP-II, bipolar 2

967
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,320
is these four days or less

968
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,330
of mania or hypomania,

969
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,420
but only 4% of the time or 5% of the time

970
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,750
is a small enough sliver of the pie

971
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,790
that is these people's existence

972
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,430
that you could imagine why it would be

973
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,680
easy for them or other people

974
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,590
to overlook the fact that
they have bipolar disorder

975
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,610
and not major depression.

976
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,443
Think about it.

977
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:44,640
This is a person who, or I should say

978
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,900
a collection of people who are spending

979
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,240
about half of their time depressed,

980
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,470
close to half, 45% of
their time symptom-free,

981
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,130
and then about 5% of their
time in a hypomanic state.

982
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,860
So either shorten bouts of

983
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,430
high intensity mania or hypomania

984
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,500
that is of reduced intensity.

985
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,020
One of the reasons that I
mentioned these percentages

986
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,300
of time spent in a
symptom-free, depressed manic

987
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,340
or hypomanic state is
because one of my major goals

988
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,820
for today's episode is that
it will increase awareness

989
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,820
of whether or not you
or somebody you know,

990
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,950
could be a coworker, could
be family member, et cetera,

991
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,680
might be suffering from
bipolar 1 or bipolar 2.

992
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,570
I think it's fair to say
that if somebody is suffering

993
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,250
from bipolar 1,

994
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,190
that is likely to be revealed

995
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,340
or to reveal itself

996
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,420
before too long, because of the fact

997
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,307
that people have these
extended periods of mania

998
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:37,350
and mania is such an extreme state,

999
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,480
not just for the person
who's experiencing it,

1000
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,700
but the way that it
presents is just so extreme

1001
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,530
and out of the ordinary.

1002
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,570
But bipolar 2, you can imagine

1003
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,610
could really duck under the radar

1004
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,870
of our awareness.

1005
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,820
And you could imagine
that we might just think

1006
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,230
somebody is low or depressed,

1007
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,510
especially if that person
tends to self-medicate

1008
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,460
with alcohol or other substances.

1009
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,500
We might think, oh, they're
drinking more than often

1010
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,790
more than usual, excuse me,

1011
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,580
or they're spending more
time alone and isolating.

1012
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,200
But then when they're in
their hypomanic state,

1013
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,690
that might actually
present as normal to us

1014
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,390
because they were in such
a depressed state before.

1015
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,940
So it's very important that
we dial up our awareness,

1016
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,250
that we have tune our
antennae to the possibility

1017
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,350
that people out there who
might appear depressed

1018
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,880
or that we haven't heard from in a while

1019
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,580
might actually be suffering
from bipolar 2 disorder.

1020
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,980
Before we move into a in-depth discussion

1021
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,330
about the different kinds of treatments

1022
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,920
for bipolar disorder,

1023
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,620
I'd like to touch on just
a few additional aspects

1024
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,050
of what bipolar disorder can do

1025
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,730
in terms of its negative consequences.

1026
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,310
And also talk about some
of the inherited risk

1027
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,230
that is the genetic factors

1028
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,300
and the environmental
factors that can contribute

1029
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,620
to bipolar disorder.

1030
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,290
In terms of the burden,

1031
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,470
the very real, emotional, and occupational

1032
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,570
and educational burden that can occur

1033
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,670
for somebody with bipolar disorder,

1034
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,720
that's actually been studied.

1035
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,940
There's a measure of this,
it's called global burden

1036
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,820
which is defined as the years lost

1037
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,330
in engaging a normal life
due to some disability.

1038
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,220
So that disability could be cancer

1039
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,070
or that disability, in this
case, is bipolar disorder.

1040
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,890
And basically the way
this sort of study is done

1041
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,210
is that through questionnaires,

1042
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,610
I should say quite
in-depth questionnaires,

1043
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,360
there's a probing for whether
or not somebody has lost

1044
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,610
two consecutive weeks or more

1045
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,500
of interest in normal activities.

1046
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,060
Now, for people who have depression,

1047
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,550
that's a kind of straightforward
thing to address, right?

1048
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,890
You ask somebody, when
was the last time you ate,

1049
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,750
or when was the last time
that you went a few days

1050
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,340
without food or lost interest

1051
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,910
in relationships or work or
sex or things of that sort

1052
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,890
and they answer and you can figure out

1053
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,990
the amount of time that you've essentially

1054
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,473
been withdrawn from normal
levels of activity for them.

1055
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,250
With bipolar disorder, What it turns out

1056
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,760
is that the global burden
of having bipolar 1

1057
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,130
and even bipolar 2 is massive.

1058
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,740
In fact, having bipolar disorder

1059
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,070
sits as one of the highest risk factors

1060
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,680
for being in the top 10

1061
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,930
of all categories of disabilities

1062
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,100
leading to global burden.

1063
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,780
Put in plain English, what that means is

1064
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,900
having bipolar 1 or bipolar 2 disorder

1065
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,520
is extremely debilitating.

1066
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,270
It really slows down one's life trajectory

1067
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,130
unless it's treated properly.

1068
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,380
Now, the other aspect of bipolar disorder

1069
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,700
is its heritability.

1070
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,700
And this gets into a little
bit of some tricky science

1071
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,910
related to inheritability versus

1072
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,050
the genetic contribution
of a given disease.

1073
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,030
So that might sound like the same thing,

1074
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,340
you think, okay, genes
relate to heritability,

1075
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,750
heritability relates to genes,

1076
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,570
but of course, everything about the way

1077
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,670
that our nervous system
works and functions

1078
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,370
and expresses itself,
healthy or otherwise,

1079
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,710
is an interaction between our genes

1080
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,060
and our environment.

1081
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,130
And so typically the way
these studies are done

1082
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,620
is you address what is the risk

1083
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,660
of somebody having a given condition

1084
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,740
in the general population?

1085
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,690
We talked about that
before, bipolar disorder

1086
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,150
is a 1% of the world's population.

1087
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,030
Compare that to people who
have only major depression.

1088
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,070
So this would be repeated bouts

1089
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,950
of two weeks or more
of serious depression,

1090
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,650
not just low mood or
something due to a life loss,

1091
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,840
but major depression,

1092
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,921
which is 10 to 17% of people
have major depression.

1093
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:17,130
They suffer from major
depressive disorder,

1094
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,770
compared to bipolar disorder
which, again, is 1%.

1095
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:24,122
Now, you can address how much of the 1%

1096
00:41:24,122 --> 00:41:26,100
of bipolar disorder that exists is due

1097
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,440
to genes versus environment

1098
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,210
in a somewhat exact way.

1099
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,740
This is never an exact science.

1100
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,360
And the way that this is typically done

1101
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,430
is to look at concordance,

1102
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:40,020
that is the likelihood
that two identical twins

1103
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,390
will both have a given condition

1104
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,190
as opposed to two fraternal twins,

1105
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,890
which have more different genes

1106
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,210
than identical twins, of course.

1107
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,240
And then two siblings who
have similar genes, of course,

1108
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,420
but less similar than
identical or fraternal twins

1109
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,500
and so on and so forth.

1110
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,550
So what you basically do

1111
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,590
is you evaluate the
probability that two people

1112
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,320
in the general population
who are completely unrelated

1113
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,939
will have the same
condition, versus two people

1114
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:06,600
in the general population
who are very related,

1115
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,433
identical twins.

1116
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:10,920
And what you find is
that in identical twins,

1117
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,790
if one identical twin
has true major depression

1118
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,650
or major depressive disorder,

1119
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,770
there's a 20 to 45% chance

1120
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,050
that their identical twin will also have

1121
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,670
major depressive disorder.

1122
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,410
Now that tells you right there

1123
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,360
that it can't all be genes,

1124
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,670
that is not a gene for
major depression per se,

1125
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,360
or if it is a gene or
a collection of genes,

1126
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,100
that those genes are also subject

1127
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,480
to environmental influences,

1128
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,890
either prenatal, within the womb

1129
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,140
or after children are born.

1130
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,510
Now the large range there of 20 to 45%

1131
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,400
could be due to any number of things.

1132
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,110
It could be experimental,

1133
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,030
meaning the techniques that
were used in experiments,

1134
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,540
it could be due to regional differences,

1135
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,770
one part of the world versus another.

1136
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,480
There are a lot of different factors.

1137
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,760
Right now, we probably
shouldn't delve into all that.

1138
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,170
At some point, we'll
probably do an episode

1139
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,740
all about the genetics of
nervous system heritability

1140
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,590
and heritability of features
and mental health, et cetera.

1141
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,980
But we can compare major
depression and the heritability

1142
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,770
or the genetic concordance
between identical twins

1143
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,110
in major depression and
bipolar disorder and ask,

1144
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:16,860
if one twin of an identical twin pair

1145
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,813
has bipolar depression,

1146
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,380
what is the likelihood that
the other twin will have it?

1147
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,710
And it turns out that
number is much higher.

1148
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,980
It's 40 to 70% likelihood or probability

1149
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,820
that if one twin has bipolar disorder,

1150
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,580
that their identical twin will
also have bipolar disorder.

1151
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,230
So again, the total
incidence of bipolar disorder

1152
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,510
in the general population is much lower

1153
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:43,830
than it is for major depressions,

1154
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,120
1% for bipolar versus 10 to
17% for major depression.

1155
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,270
But the genetic component is much higher,

1156
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,760
40 to 70% for bipolar disorder

1157
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,850
versus 20 to 45% for major depression.

1158
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:00,240
I know I'm throwing a
lot of numbers out there,

1159
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,950
but basically what this means

1160
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:05,520
is that researchers have been
able to take those numbers

1161
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,820
and filter them through a
number of different risk factors

1162
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,890
that are related to early development,

1163
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,710
ask questions like if two
twins were raised separately

1164
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,350
or together, or in one part
of the world versus another,

1165
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,170
or had a two parent household
versus one parent household,

1166
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,210
evaluate a lot of different variables,

1167
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,130
what they were able to discover,

1168
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,080
and this has been shown again and again,

1169
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,080
is that the genetic
contribution to bipolar disorder

1170
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,040
is very, very high.

1171
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,423
That is the heritability
of bipolar disorder is 85%.

1172
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,893
So again, I want to be
really clear what this means,

1173
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,020
the total occurrence in the
general population, fairly low,

1174
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,910
still serious, 1%,

1175
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,130
but fairly low compared to other things

1176
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,120
like major depression.

1177
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,110
However, if someone has bipolar disorder,

1178
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,690
it's very likely that they inherited

1179
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,490
some gene or sets of genes,

1180
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,170
or more accurately, a
susceptibility within their genes

1181
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,760
to environmental influences

1182
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,250
that can trigger bipolar disorder.

1183
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,410
There are a lot of
different ways to discuss

1184
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,330
and to conceptualize heritability

1185
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,830
so I want to be very careful with the way

1186
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,390
that I'm wording this.

1187
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,540
What this means is that
people with bipolar disorder

1188
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,540
very likely have a gene, or more typically

1189
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,070
it's going to be a set of genes

1190
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,680
that creates a susceptibility
for bipolar disorder

1191
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,510
to present itself.

1192
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,360
Now, what environmental factors trigger

1193
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,470
or increase that susceptibility
is not entirely clear.

1194
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,760
This always seems to center back

1195
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,220
onto the same sets of things like

1196
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,020
early life stress, trauma, et cetera,

1197
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,690
certainly those are going
to exacerbate the likelihood

1198
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,670
that someone who has a genetic propensity

1199
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,950
for bipolar disorder will express

1200
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:47,783
that bipolar disorder

1201
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:50,310
and its full array of symptomology,

1202
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:55,310
but 85%, while very,
very high, is not 100%.

1203
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,380
Again, 85%, while a very high number

1204
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,180
for heritability is not 100%.

1205
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,600
What that means is that
there is no single gene

1206
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,260
or identified gene cluster
for bipolar disorder.

1207
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,270
The reason I keep drilling
into this over and over

1208
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,280
is that I think we can confidently say

1209
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,810
that if someone has bipolar disorder,

1210
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,150
that there was something
in their genetic lineage

1211
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,210
that led to that, or that
very likely led to that,

1212
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,380
and yet it's not like eye color

1213
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,630
or some other physical feature,

1214
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,300
which we can actually do the direct,

1215
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,710
so it's called Mendelian genetics,

1216
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,590
and figure out whether or not somebody

1217
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,660
directly inherited that
gene from one parent

1218
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,493
or the other parent.

1219
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:37,920
So the takeaway here is that if you have

1220
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,930
certainly an identical
twin, or a fraternal twin,

1221
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,460
or a sibling or a parent,

1222
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,720
or even a cousin or an uncle

1223
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,890
that has bipolar disorder,
in particular bipolar 1,

1224
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,380
well, then you need to be on the lookout

1225
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,840
for bipolar disorder, perhaps in yourself

1226
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,850
and for the family members of that person.

1227
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,370
My goal within this episode up until now

1228
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,700
has been to provide a
clear and detailed picture

1229
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,030
of bipolar disorder and its various forms.

1230
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,770
Before we start to talk about treatments

1231
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,920
for bipolar disorder and some
of the neural circuit basis

1232
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,480
for bipolar disorder,

1233
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,180
I want to make sure that I
distinguish bipolar disorder

1234
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,240
from borderline personality disorder.

1235
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,740
We will do an entire episode

1236
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,150
or maybe even several episodes

1237
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,520
about borderline personality disorder.

1238
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,530
Borderline personality disorder

1239
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,230
can indeed present itself

1240
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,490
in ways that resemble bipolar
disorder and vice versa,

1241
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:32,340
but there's some key
distinctions that need to be made

1242
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,470
because it turns out that bipolar disorder

1243
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,990
and borderline personality disorder

1244
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,113
are quite distinct in terms
of their defining criteria.

1245
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,840
The key distinction between somebody

1246
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,300
with borderline personality disorder

1247
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,220
and bipolar disorder

1248
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,340
is that in borderline
personality disorder,

1249
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,360
there can be episodes that can
resemble mania or hypomania.

1250
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,550
So periods of flights of ideas,

1251
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,070
or where people are
spending money excessively

1252
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,410
or sexually promiscuous in ways

1253
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,270
that seem manic or could even be

1254
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,670
a little bit manic or a lot manic,

1255
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,280
and yet more often than not,

1256
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,590
there is an environmental trigger

1257
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,270
for those manic episodes.

1258
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:15,990
That is distinctly different
from bipolar disorder

1259
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,330
where the person will have manic episodes

1260
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,340
without any need for a trigger.

1261
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,380
There doesn't need to be a call

1262
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,290
from someone saying, hey, let's
go on a vacation together,

1263
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,480
or there's something coming up this Friday

1264
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,770
that's really exciting,

1265
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,170
or let's enter a relationship together

1266
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,400
of one form or another.

1267
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,460
The person with bipolar disorder
will have episodes of mania

1268
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,590
or episodes of major depression

1269
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,500
without any need for an external stimulus

1270
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,150
or environmental trigger.

1271
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,940
But the person with borderline
personality disorder,

1272
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,230
almost always, again,

1273
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,450
there's never an always
in biology and psychiatry,

1274
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,040
but almost always is going
to exhibit flights of mania

1275
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,800
or depressive episodes or
other types of mood shifts

1276
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,990
that are dramatic and maladaptive

1277
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,110
in response to things
that are coming in through

1278
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,060
the external environment or relationships

1279
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,893
of some kind.

1280
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,700
In fact, one of the
defining characteristics

1281
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,860
of borderline personality disorder

1282
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,050
is this thing that's
referred to as splitting.

1283
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,090
A good example of splitting in a person

1284
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,100
with borderline personality disorder

1285
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,850
is that they will feel that
they absolutely adore you

1286
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,650
and want to spend all their time with you

1287
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,060
and just think the world of you.

1288
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,230
You can do no wrong.

1289
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,380
And in fact, they
genuinely can feel that way

1290
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,720
and can genuinely think
that way about you.

1291
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,000
And then for whatever reason,

1292
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,190
it could be a perception of something

1293
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,260
that you did or something that you said

1294
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,110
or suspicion that you're
thinking something about them,

1295
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:41,510
they can suddenly shift
or split their emotions

1296
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:45,030
in what's called move
you from a good object

1297
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,240
or a can do no wrong
object to a bad object.

1298
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,760
They'll suddenly decide that
you are cheating on them

1299
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,220
or that you are being mean to them

1300
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,540
or that you're insulting them

1301
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,080
or that something that
you're doing is in violation

1302
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,660
to their self worth,
their wellbeing, et cetera

1303
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,550
and that can send them down a pathway

1304
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,950
of being very angry, very
depressed, et cetera.

1305
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,810
As I describe the contour of a person

1306
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,790
with borderline personality disorder

1307
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,520
as somebody who splits
very suddenly in response

1308
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,460
to some environmental
trigger, real or perceived,

1309
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,170
there's the risk, of course,

1310
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,970
that it makes the person with borderline

1311
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,340
personality disorder
sound like a bad person,

1312
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,080
that they're very volatile.

1313
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,790
And while they can be volatile,

1314
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,410
I want to be very careful to point out

1315
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,660
that the person with
borderline personality disorder

1316
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,300
is also suffering in this context.

1317
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,210
So while those sorts of relationships

1318
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,790
with people with borderline
personality disorder,

1319
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,620
whether or not they're
romantic relationships

1320
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,690
or familial or coworkers, et cetera,

1321
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,030
can be very challenged,
can be very high friction

1322
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:46,470
because of the good object,
bad object shifts, et cetera,

1323
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,390
it's bidirectional, meaning the person

1324
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,950
with borderline personality disorder,

1325
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,600
as you can imagine, is also going through

1326
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,433
a lot of suffering.

1327
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,580
At one moment, they feel

1328
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,680
as if someone is wonderful
and can do no wrong

1329
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,540
to them and they want to
be so strongly affiliated

1330
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,250
with them, and then in the next moment,

1331
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,410
they feel as if that
person is attacking them

1332
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,050
through their actions or even
through their non actions.

1333
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,640
So again, we will return

1334
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,470
to borderline personality disorder

1335
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,960
in a separate episode,
it's a serious disorder,

1336
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,220
both for the person that has it

1337
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,630
and for people around them.

1338
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,460
Fortunately, there are
some emerging treatments

1339
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,200
that are showing promise

1340
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,540
and it's a fairly common disorder,

1341
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,610
but it's important that we distinguish

1342
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,850
borderline personality
disorder from bipolar disorder,

1343
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,980
mostly on the basis of
this need for a trigger.

1344
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,980
Again, in bipolar
disorder, there is no need

1345
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,140
for a trigger to create a manic episode

1346
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,490
or a major depressive episode,

1347
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,670
they just happen or they can just happen.

1348
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,340
Whereas in borderline
personality disorder,

1349
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,560
almost always there's an external trigger

1350
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,600
or a perception that something happened

1351
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,240
in the environment or
that somebody is behaving

1352
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,130
a certain way that dramatically shifts

1353
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,620
the person with borderline
personality disorder

1354
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,480
from one mode to the next.

1355
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,820
As we move into our discussion
about the treatments for

1356
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,550
and neural circuits
underlying bipolar disorder,

1357
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,970
I want to just nail
down one more key point.

1358
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,470
This is a very brief point

1359
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:05,370
but it's perhaps the most
important point, which is

1360
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,150
the highs and lows, or
we should say the highs,

1361
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,490
these manic episodes, and sometimes lows,

1362
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:12,540
'cause again, not everybody

1363
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,130
with bipolar disorder 1 or 2

1364
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,900
suffers from depressive episodes,

1365
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,640
sometimes yes, sometimes no,

1366
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,830
in particular in bipolar 2, yes,

1367
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,770
but people with bipolar 1 can
have extreme manic episodes

1368
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:25,050
and then just return to
normal as you recall.

1369
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,470
Well, those extreme lows
and or extreme highs

1370
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,510
of people with bipolar disorder

1371
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,990
impact their lives in very negative ways.

1372
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,060
This is essential and it's something

1373
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,650
that we're going to return
to a little bit later

1374
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,030
when we talk about the relationship

1375
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,610
between bipolar disorder and creativity,

1376
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,380
because it turns out that there's a quite

1377
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,480
strong association there,

1378
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,190
one that would almost lead you to believe

1379
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,720
that being bipolar can be beneficial

1380
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,283
in certain contexts, and yet,

1381
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,210
on whole, having bipolar disorder

1382
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,880
is extremely detrimental and challenging

1383
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,320
to the person suffering from it.

1384
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,970
And it's something that
we want to keep in mind

1385
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,450
as we think about treatments
and the underlying biology.

1386
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,250
Now I'd like to talk about
some of the treatments

1387
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,900
for bipolar disorder.

1388
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,880
And in the discussion of those treatments,

1389
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,820
there's an absolutely incredible history

1390
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,280
of the discovery of one
particular treatment

1391
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,120
that still shows great
success in many patients,

1392
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,280
although some people
can't take it for reasons

1393
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,540
that we'll talk about.

1394
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,940
And in the description of the discovery

1395
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,280
of this treatment for bipolar disorder,

1396
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,070
it also reveals to us that sometimes

1397
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,820
treatments come to the
profession of medicine

1398
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,630
and through science in ways that precede

1399
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,510
the discovery of the underlying biology.

1400
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,610
That's right, every once in a while,

1401
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,400
someone will discover a
treatment for a disease

1402
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,290
without any understanding

1403
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,630
about the underlying biological basis

1404
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,950
of that disease.

1405
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,800
And in fact, that is the
case for bipolar disorder

1406
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,840
and the treatment that we are referring to

1407
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,580
is lithium.

1408
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,040
Lithium, as some of you know,

1409
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,470
is on the periodic table of elements.

1410
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,440
It is indeed a naturally
occurring substance.

1411
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,250
It actually arrived on
earth by way of star dust.

1412
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,040
Yes, we are talking about
star dust on this podcast,

1413
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,530
but if you'd like to learn more
about the origins of lithium

1414
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,810
and how lithium arrived here on earth

1415
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:18,960
for its discovery and
applications in psychiatry,

1416
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,660
there's a beautiful talk
that exists on YouTube

1417
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,740
and we'll provide a link to this

1418
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,860
in the show note captions that describes

1419
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,930
the history of lithium in terms

1420
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,910
of its interplanetary travels

1421
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,260
and arrival on earth.

1422
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,140
This is a talk delivered by a physicist

1423
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,390
who is expert in quantum mechanics

1424
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:38,280
and is expert in lithium.

1425
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,740
And it's a just wonderful
talk that I can refer you to,

1426
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,360
less on the biology in that talk,

1427
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,370
but certainly a lot about
lithium as an element.

1428
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,830
So for those of you nerds like me,

1429
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,820
that love to know how things
came to be here on the planet

1430
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,380
in one form or another,

1431
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,260
I'll encourage you to take
a brief listen to that talk.

1432
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,360
We are going to discuss
lithium in the context

1433
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,510
of its applications for
treatment of bipolar disorder.

1434
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,340
And the discovery of
lithium as a treatment

1435
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,940
for bipolar disorder is
truly a miraculous story

1436
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,530
that I think everyone should know.

1437
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,400
The key player in this
story is a physician

1438
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,880
by the last name Cade, he
was an Australian physician.

1439
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,180
And Cade has a very interesting
story in his own right.

1440
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,070
Cade was an Australian psychiatrist

1441
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,830
or Australian psychiatrist

1442
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,810
who also was a soldier.

1443
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,300
And during World War II,

1444
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,130
after the fall of Singapore to Japan,

1445
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,350
he became a prisoner of war

1446
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:35,580
and he was a prisoner of
war from 1942 until 1945.

1447
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,800
So he had some time for observation

1448
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,480
and during his imprisonment,

1449
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,730
he observed some of his fellow inmates

1450
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,580
is going through pretty wild vacillations

1451
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,260
in mood and energy,

1452
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,510
essentially going from manic episodes

1453
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,810
to depressed episodes, or
from manic to normal episodes.

1454
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,870
And for one reason or another,

1455
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,090
we don't know why because
I couldn't find any report

1456
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,040
as to why he hypothesized this,

1457
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,620
but he hypothesized that
there was some buildup

1458
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,400
of some chemical in these people's brains

1459
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,980
that then they would urinate out.

1460
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,700
And that urinating out
of whatever chemical

1461
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,940
was in there would allow
them to be more relaxed

1462
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,773
and not manic.

1463
00:56:15,773 --> 00:56:17,880
In other words, Cade hypothesized

1464
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,260
that there's a buildup of a chemical

1465
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,240
in certain people's brains
that makes them manic

1466
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,610
and they urinate that chemical out.

1467
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:27,120
So eventually he got out of this prison,

1468
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,040
as we mentioned in 1945,

1469
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,960
and he started doing experiments

1470
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,870
in addition to seeing
patients in his clinic.

1471
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,060
And what he did is he
started to take urine

1472
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,280
from people who exhibited mania

1473
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,980
and urine from people who were not manic,

1474
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,500
and he took that urine
and he would inject it

1475
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,410
into guinea pigs as an experimental model.

1476
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:49,740
And his general observation was that

1477
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,480
there was something in the urine

1478
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,170
that was indeed making
the guinea pigs more manic

1479
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:59,670
if they were injected with
urine from a manic patient.

1480
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,250
The exact measures that he was
taking in these guinea pigs

1481
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,300
wasn't exactly clear.

1482
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,180
This is at a time or an era in science

1483
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,280
when you could just sort of report things

1484
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,720
a little bit more subjectively,

1485
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,210
although there were still
numbers and statistics,

1486
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,550
it was a little bit more
of like case studies

1487
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,170
and descriptions, but it turns out

1488
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,270
that even though that all
seems a little bit loose,

1489
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,930
it led to some incredible and
still important discoveries

1490
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,670
for psychiatric health.

1491
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,220
So what he figured out was that the urine

1492
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,290
from manic patients
seemed to be more toxic

1493
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,850
for these guinea pigs.

1494
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:33,420
And he also knew that there
are two toxic substances

1495
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,810
in urine, urea and uric acid.

1496
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:40,170
So he was able to separate
the urea and uric acid

1497
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,880
from people with mania

1498
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,580
and patients that did not have mania.

1499
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,630
And he figured out that the
urea was the same in both

1500
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,820
these mentally ill, manic patients

1501
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,620
and the non manic patients.

1502
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,840
So it did not seem that urea

1503
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,680
was the compound that was
creating these manic episodes

1504
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,720
or related to manic episodes

1505
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,850
or held the toxicity

1506
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:05,790
so instead he focused on the uric acid.

1507
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:09,510
Now in order to put the
uric acid into solution

1508
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,790
so that he could inject
it into these guinea pigs,

1509
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,890
he had to try a number
of different compounds

1510
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,820
in order to dilute it.

1511
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,470
It just so happens that,

1512
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,210
and you chemists will
be familiar with this,

1513
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,190
but there's certain
things that just don't go

1514
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,180
into solution easily.

1515
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,160
You put the powder in a vial,

1516
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,440
you add some water or a
saline or another solution,

1517
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,310
you mix it up and the powder
stays suspended in there,

1518
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,610
it doesn't actually ever
become a clear liquid

1519
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:33,960
that you can inject.

1520
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,930
So in order to try injecting
different strengths

1521
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,160
of uric acid,

1522
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,530
he ended up using lithium

1523
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,740
to assist in the dilution,
and lithium worked.

1524
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,210
So what he basically was doing,

1525
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,110
again for you chemists,

1526
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,440
is he was taking uric acid,
he was adding lithium,

1527
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,663
and making a solution of lithium urate.

1528
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,440
this is a lot of details,
but this is important

1529
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,540
because what he eventually found

1530
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,660
is that when he diluted the uric acid

1531
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,880
with lithium and created lithium urate,

1532
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,370
lithium urate could actually

1533
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,040
calm down these guinea
pigs that were injected

1534
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,350
with the toxic urea.

1535
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,170
He also found that lithium urate

1536
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,890
had a generally calming
effect on these guinea pigs.

1537
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,530
So now we're really
off in crazy territory,

1538
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,720
we're talking about urine from patients

1539
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,900
that's separating out urea and uric acid,

1540
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,030
we're adding lithium to the uric acid,

1541
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,323
we're injecting this into guinea pigs,

1542
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:30,750
this is getting pretty
wild and pretty weird,

1543
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,360
but this is medicine,
and from time to time,

1544
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,013
this is medicine and science.

1545
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,340
Cade was a good scientist in addition

1546
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,900
to being a good physician,

1547
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,550
and by good scientists,

1548
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,500
I mean that he did control experiments.

1549
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,390
Here he was injecting
lithium urate into animals

1550
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,620
and seeing an effect,

1551
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,680
but he knew that that
solution of lithium urate

1552
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,500
contained not just the uric acid,

1553
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,030
but it also contained lithium.

1554
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,090
And so he quite appropriately asked,

1555
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:04,080
maybe the lithium alone is
having this calming effect

1556
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,460
on these guinea pigs.

1557
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,260
And indeed, that was the case.

1558
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,210
When he did the proper control experiment

1559
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:14,210
and injected only lithium
solution into these guinea pigs,

1560
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,510
they calmed down.

1561
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:20,040
From there, he in sort
of 1940 style medicine,

1562
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,990
this would not happen now,

1563
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:24,030
he very quickly moved
from that animal model

1564
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,720
into human patients and started
injecting human patients

1565
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,650
with lithium or providing
lithium orally to those patients.

1566
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:36,120
And lo and behold, found
an absolutely profound

1567
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,850
and positive effect of lithium

1568
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,370
in reducing symptoms of mania.

1569
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:44,040
And as all good physician scientists do,

1570
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,720
he wrote up his results.

1571
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,960
And he wrote it up in a paper entitled,

1572
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,380
Lithium Salts in the Treatment
of Psychotic Excitement.

1573
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,640
Okay, back then they didn't call it mania,

1574
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,890
they called it psychotic excitement.

1575
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:58,710
This is a paper that was
published September 3rd, 1949

1576
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,630
in the Medical Journal of Australia.

1577
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,190
We will provide a link to this study,

1578
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,520
is now a classic study in
the field of psychiatry.

1579
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,260
It's a really wonderful paper to read.

1580
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,270
And actually I encourage people,

1581
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:12,690
even if you're not a
scientist or a clinician

1582
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,850
to just take a quick
look at the second page

1583
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,790
in this paper that we've
made available to you

1584
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,420
where he describes each of
the various case studies

1585
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,580
or the individuals that he looked at.

1586
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,170
I'm not going to read these in detail now,

1587
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,120
'cause it would take a
lot of unnecessary time,

1588
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,650
but things like case seven,
MC, aged 40-years-old,

1589
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,440
suffering from manic recurrent mania.

1590
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,370
In this episode, he'd
been excited, restless,

1591
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:36,930
and violent for over two months

1592
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,175
and was interfering so often

1593
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,570
that had to be confined to a single room

1594
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,500
during the day.

1595
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,810
So this is very debilitating,

1596
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,910
what we now know to be bipolar depression.

1597
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:48,330
He commenced taking
lithium citrate, 20 grains,

1598
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,370
that's a measure of the amount of lithium,

1599
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,203
three times a day.

1600
01:01:51,203 --> 01:01:53,760
In four days, he was distinctly quieter

1601
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,470
and by February 13th, 1949,
appeared practically normal.

1602
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,930
He continued well and
on February 20th, 1949,

1603
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,090
the dose of citrate was
reduced to 10 grains,

1604
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:03,923
et cetera, et cetera.

1605
01:02:03,923 --> 01:02:05,370
He left the hospital.

1606
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:07,290
There are numerous descriptions

1607
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,760
of this sort within this paper,

1608
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,350
including some descriptions of patients

1609
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,870
that did not see such success,

1610
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,240
and including some
descriptions of patients

1611
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,210
that suffered from some
negative side effects.

1612
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,010
So that's important to point out as well,

1613
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,260
but it's an absolutely wonderful paper

1614
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,720
and it's an absolutely wonderful voyage

1615
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,310
into the history of psychiatry

1616
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,050
right down to the discussion where

1617
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,300
in just three short paragraphs,

1618
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,720
Cade really lays out the case for why

1619
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,000
lithium is such a important discovery

1620
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,980
in the treatment of what, at that time,

1621
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,480
they were calling psychotic excitement

1622
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,320
and what we now know to be
manic bipolar depression.

1623
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,790
Lithium, I should mention,

1624
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,410
has a number of important features,

1625
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,690
but it also a number of
important side effects

1626
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,710
that need to be considered.

1627
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,050
First of all, it does have

1628
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:54,720
a certain toxicity and
so levels of lithium

1629
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,690
in the blood need to be
monitored extremely carefully.

1630
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,100
So it's not the sort of thing that people

1631
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,810
can just take at a given dose

1632
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,460
and every patient responds the same,

1633
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,740
there's a lot of oversight
and a lot of blood tests

1634
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,573
that have to be done,

1635
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,850
especially in the first three
months of lithium treatment.

1636
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,260
I should mention that lithium treatment

1637
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,160
is still used to some great
degree of success in many,

1638
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,820
not all people suffering
from bipolar depression,

1639
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,503
or bipolar disorder rather,

1640
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,850
but there are a number of
important things that happened

1641
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,490
between 1949 and present day

1642
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:30,630
that prevented lithium
from reaching patients

1643
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:31,470
that really needed it.

1644
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,150
And that all can be summarized

1645
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,160
in two or three short sentences.

1646
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,980
Basically, by virtue of
the fact that lithium

1647
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,310
is a naturally occurring element,
it could not be patented.

1648
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,110
And as a consequence of that,

1649
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,060
there wasn't a lot of potential profit

1650
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,040
for drug companies to produce lithium.

1651
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,670
In fact, still to this
day, it's very low cost,

1652
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,090
and still to this day, no
one really owns the patent

1653
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,280
for lithium in its purest form.

1654
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,780
So that made it unattractive.

1655
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,090
It turns out that the
FDA in the United States

1656
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,580
didn't allow lithium to
be used as a treatment

1657
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,720
for manic bipolar disorder until 1970.

1658
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,850
So we're talking about a full 21 years

1659
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:11,700
from the publication of this paper by Cade

1660
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,110
in the Medical Journal of Australia

1661
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,030
showing quite beautifully

1662
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,820
the great potential in use of lithium

1663
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,940
for quelling the symptoms
of bipolar disorder

1664
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,360
until the first patients
in the United States

1665
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,580
were starting to access lithium regularly.

1666
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,290
And nowadays, of course,
lithium is available,

1667
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,480
but still not able to be patented

1668
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,790
'cause it's element number
three on the periodic table,

1669
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,170
it's naturally occurring.

1670
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,750
It's not literally falling
down from the stars as stardust

1671
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,740
and going into pill form,

1672
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,370
but rather it can be synthesized

1673
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:43,410
in laboratories, but it is available.

1674
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:47,040
It does show not only great
potential in many patients

1675
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,200
but great application in many patients

1676
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,120
despite its side effects.

1677
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,230
So lithium really stands as
this kind of golden example

1678
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:58,710
of a treatment that works,
at least in many individuals,

1679
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,980
prior to an understanding
of the biological basis

1680
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,920
of the disease for which
that treatment is needed.

1681
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,050
Now with that said,
scientists and clinicians

1682
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,780
have been quite rigorous
in trying to understand

1683
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:13,110
why and how lithium works
in order to understand

1684
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,240
the why and how of bipolar disorder.

1685
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,580
This is the way that proper
medicine and science is done.

1686
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,130
Even if there's an excellent
treatment for something,

1687
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:22,980
it's important to understand
why that treatment works

1688
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,900
because, first of all, not everyone

1689
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,950
responds to that treatment.

1690
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,400
Second of all, scientists
and physicians understand

1691
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,950
that just because we have
one treatment that works,

1692
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,290
if it has any side effects at all,

1693
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,720
there is the possibility
for better treatments.

1694
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,870
So it's not just about
trying to bypass a drug

1695
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,700
that doesn't make much
money for drug companies,

1696
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,350
I know a lot of people
think in those terms,

1697
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,790
they think, oh, well,

1698
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,710
there's this continued
search for better treatments

1699
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,960
for bipolar disorder
even though lithium works

1700
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,610
because lithium doesn't
allow drug companies

1701
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,660
to make much money.

1702
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,860
That's not really the case.

1703
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,230
The fact of the matter
is is that the toxicity,

1704
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:58,590
some of the other issues that
are created with lithium,

1705
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,970
the fact that people need

1706
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:02,880
the ongoing blood testing, et cetera,

1707
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,940
really stimulates the
need, really an urgent need

1708
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,130
for new and better treatments
for bipolar disorder.

1709
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,320
And only by understanding
how lithium works

1710
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,810
at the cellular level, at
the neural circuit level,

1711
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,760
et cetera, do we really stand to find

1712
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,020
those new discoveries.

1713
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,170
If you were to do a literature search on

1714
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,960
the actions and mechanisms of lithium

1715
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,240
in terms of how it can calm people down

1716
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,280
and reduce their manic episodes,

1717
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,010
you would find an
enormous array of papers,

1718
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,650
literally thousands of scientific studies

1719
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:33,990
in animals and in humans,

1720
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,200
which, for instance will tell
you that lithium treatment

1721
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,660
will increase so-called BDNF,

1722
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,270
brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

1723
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:44,550
BDNF is often talked about in the context

1724
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,690
of neuroplasticity,

1725
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,340
the brain and nervous system's ability

1726
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,410
to change in response to experience.

1727
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:53,340
And indeed it does seem
that ingesting lithium

1728
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,141
increases BDNF.

1729
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:59,280
BDNF is what we call
permissive for neuroplasticity.

1730
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,070
It doesn't create specific
changes in the brain,

1731
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,410
meaning it's not going to
make your memory better

1732
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:06,360
or your coordination better,

1733
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,790
or your emotional state better per se,

1734
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:12,540
what BDNF does is it permits the neurons,

1735
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,030
the nerve cells and their
connections in the brain

1736
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,910
to be more likely to change

1737
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:21,570
if the proper environmental
conditions are met.

1738
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:26,520
That is BDNF creates a kind of
buoyancy to neuroplasticity.

1739
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,950
It opens the gates to neuroplasticity.

1740
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,230
So lithium does increase BDNF,

1741
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,030
we'll talk about why that's
important in the context

1742
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,890
of the neural circuits involved

1743
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,410
with bipolar disorder in a few minutes.

1744
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:41,220
It also seems to be a
potent anti-inflammatory.

1745
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:42,870
Now, inflammation is one of those words

1746
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:45,180
that's thrown around extensively nowadays,

1747
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,520
especially on social media
and especially as it relates

1748
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,650
to any health condition,
it's like inflammation,

1749
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,620
inflammation, inflammation,
always seems to be discussed

1750
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,450
in the context of inflammation being bad.

1751
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:56,910
But I do want to point
out that inflammation

1752
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,150
is a natural adaptive
response to physical injury

1753
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:03,210
to a cell or organ or tissue of any kind.

1754
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:05,880
Inflammation is the basis by which

1755
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,250
adaptations occur to exercise.

1756
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,450
So if, for instance,

1757
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,640
you were to weight train and use a heavier

1758
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,870
than normal weight kind,

1759
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:15,810
do a set to failure or create
some little micro tears

1760
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:17,189
in the muscle that are healthy

1761
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:19,619
in the sense that they
would create adaptations

1762
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,380
and make that muscle stronger,
maybe even grow that muscle,

1763
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,689
there's an inflammatory
response associated with that

1764
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:27,389
that is critical to the
positive adaptation.

1765
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,460
So inflammation isn't always bad,

1766
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,560
although excessive, or as we say,

1767
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,899
runaway inflammation is bad.

1768
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:37,739
Lithium seems to be able to
suppress inflammation and,

1769
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,140
importantly, it can suppress inflammation

1770
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,140
in neural tissues and within
the brain in particular.

1771
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,520
That is important.

1772
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,979
And we return to that
and why it's important

1773
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:48,359
in a little bit.

1774
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,829
The other thing about lithium

1775
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:52,890
is that lithium is neuroprotective,

1776
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:56,130
that is it can prevent neurons from dying

1777
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,270
under certain conditions.

1778
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,410
Why would neurons die?

1779
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:00,359
Well, there are a lot of
reasons why neurons can die.

1780
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:01,919
There can be a physical
insult to the neurons.

1781
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,160
You can get hit really
hard in the head, a bullet,

1782
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,865
God forbid, can enter the
skull and kill neurons,

1783
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:10,560
there are a lot of reasons
why neurons can die.

1784
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,910
Neuroprotection is a
situation in which a neuron

1785
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:18,240
is given some sort of chemical
or physical resiliency

1786
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,850
that allows it to suffer an insult

1787
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:21,930
and yet bounce back.

1788
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,550
So it's very similar to
the way that we think

1789
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,020
about psychological resiliency,

1790
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,229
neuroprotection is an ability for neurons

1791
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:30,749
to be better able to handle stress

1792
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,229
of different kinds, in
particular, excitotoxicity.

1793
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:36,569
There's a phenomenon in bipolar disorder

1794
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:38,669
and a lot of other psychiatric conditions

1795
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,729
in which hyperactivity
of certain brain areas

1796
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:44,429
actually starts to kill off neurons.

1797
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,290
Hyperactivity doesn't always do this,

1798
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,120
but it turns out that if
certain brain circuits

1799
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,800
are too active for too long,

1800
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,560
some of the chemicals
associated with neuroactivity,

1801
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,720
things like calcium and neurotransmitters

1802
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,880
like glutamate can actually
kill the very neurons

1803
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,840
that are active.

1804
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,610
So it seems that lithium can prevent

1805
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:00,960
some of that neurotoxicity.

1806
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,810
Now, this turns out to
be particularly important

1807
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:05,730
for this discussion about bipolar disorder

1808
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:08,430
and the neural circuit
basis of bipolar disorder

1809
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:10,590
because if we are just
take a step back and ask,

1810
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:12,300
what's different in the brains of people

1811
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,070
with bipolar disorder?

1812
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,450
There are some very interesting answers

1813
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,890
that start to emerge.

1814
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:19,410
There are basically two
main neural circuits

1815
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:22,590
that are present in normal individuals,

1816
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,720
I say normal, I say that respectfully

1817
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,010
to the people with bipolar disorder

1818
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:28,980
by referring to people who do not suffer

1819
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:32,490
from manic episodes or
from manic depression.

1820
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:33,780
There are circuits that are present

1821
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,330
in people with bipolar disorder

1822
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,250
and in people that do not suffer

1823
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,500
from bipolar disorder,

1824
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,560
both of those circuits do the same thing

1825
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,390
in both sets of individuals,

1826
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,850
and yet in people with bipolar disorder,

1827
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:51,180
there seems to be an atrophy or a removal

1828
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,250
of certain neural connections over time

1829
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,830
that leads to a situation in which people

1830
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:59,580
with bipolar disorder become very poor

1831
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,250
at registering their own internal state,

1832
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,140
in particular, their emotional states

1833
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,850
and their somatic states.

1834
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:06,810
What we're referring to here

1835
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:08,460
is something called interoception.

1836
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,450
I've talked about this a little bit

1837
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:11,250
on the Huberman Lab Podcast before,

1838
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,770
but there are two modes of perception.

1839
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,680
Perception, of course, is a attention

1840
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,780
to something that's
happening in our environment

1841
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:21,960
or to us on or within our body.

1842
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,470
Exteroception is literally
an attention to things

1843
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,900
that are happening beyond
the confines of our skin.

1844
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,970
So seeing that person's face over there,

1845
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:32,670
or seeing that color of leaf over there,

1846
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:34,650
or hearing a sound over to my left,

1847
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:37,230
that is exteroception,
perception of things

1848
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,630
beyond the confines of one's skin.

1849
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,400
Then there's interoception

1850
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,220
which is perception of things
that are happening internally

1851
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,405
like, how full does my gut feel?

1852
01:11:46,405 --> 01:11:48,540
How fast is my heart beating?

1853
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,490
Some people can measure
that quite accurately

1854
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,310
just by thinking about
it, other people can't.

1855
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,910
How happy am I, how sad
am I, how energetic am I,

1856
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:59,010
how lethargic am I, et cetera, et cetera.

1857
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,720
So we are always existing in a balance

1858
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,450
between exteroception and interoception,

1859
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,870
but as it turns out, people
with bipolar disorder

1860
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:09,210
over time, and especially into the second

1861
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:11,970
and third decade of
having bipolar disorder

1862
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:15,240
seem to have progressively
diminished levels

1863
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,774
of interoception.

1864
01:12:16,774 --> 01:12:18,270
And that very likely is important

1865
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:20,520
in their inability to
register, for instance,

1866
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,760
that, wow, they are talking
at an excessive rate

1867
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,270
or they haven't slept
in 5 or even 10 days,

1868
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:30,210
or they haven't eaten in
a long period of time.

1869
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:35,210
This atrophy of neural
circuits for interoception

1870
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,550
is starting to emerge
as one of the defining

1871
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:40,020
neural circuit characteristics

1872
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,150
or underpinnings of bipolar.

1873
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,880
Now I bridge to this conversation
about neural circuits

1874
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,690
from the statement that
lithium can protect

1875
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:51,660
against some of the neurotoxic effects

1876
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,400
of neural circuits being very active.

1877
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,320
Now this can get a little bit complicated,

1878
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,060
but I promise I'm going to make it clear

1879
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,790
for any of you that are
watching and or listening.

1880
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,890
The reality is

1881
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:03,900
that people with bipolar depression

1882
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,270
very likely have a hyperactivity,

1883
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,010
that is an increased level of activity

1884
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,570
in certain circuits within the brain

1885
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:12,390
early in the expression of their disease.

1886
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,310
And that typically, as
I mentioned earlier,

1887
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,740
sets in around the early
20s, although sometimes

1888
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,830
that can be even earlier,
in the teens and so forth.

1889
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:22,740
But that hyperactivity, we think,

1890
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:27,300
leads to a toxicity and excitotoxicity

1891
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,160
of certain elements of the neural circuits

1892
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,650
that are responsible for interoception.

1893
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,483
In other words,

1894
01:13:32,483 --> 01:13:36,210
the overuse of certain
circuits can lead to a

1895
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,310
diminishing, an atrophy, or even a death

1896
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,990
of certain elements within those circuits

1897
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,550
and it appears that lithium,

1898
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,420
through its anti-inflammatory
and neuroprotective effects

1899
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,170
and through its ability to increase BDNF,

1900
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,270
very likely protects us against some

1901
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,240
of that atrophy of those
circuits for interoception.

1902
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,400
So this isn't a case in which

1903
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,040
people with bipolar have a neural circuit

1904
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,060
or lack a neural circuit

1905
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,220
and people without
bipolar are the opposite.

1906
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,720
This is a case in which
everyone more or less

1907
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,100
starts out the same,

1908
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,260
but it seems that there's a hyperactivity

1909
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,490
of certain neural circuits in people

1910
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,010
with bipolar disorder that over time

1911
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,410
actually causes those
circuits to diminish.

1912
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,330
Now, this is very important because some

1913
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,310
of the more recent longitudinal studies

1914
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:18,510
doing brain imaging on people

1915
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,520
with bipolar disorder and those without,

1916
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,410
and doing that over time in patients

1917
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:23,850
starting as early as their teens,

1918
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:27,630
but into their 20s and
30s reveals just that,

1919
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,910
that there can be hyperactivity
of circuits early on,

1920
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:33,810
but then hypo, reduced activity
of those very same circuits

1921
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:36,360
at a time 5 or 10 years later.

1922
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,220
Again, this speaks to
the complicated nature

1923
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,650
of bipolar disorder and
the complicated nature

1924
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:44,970
of psychiatry and linking
specific psychiatric disorders

1925
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:46,830
to neural circuits in general.

1926
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,800
Because if you have a situation in which

1927
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,410
in one disease, let's just,

1928
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:53,580
hypothesize here for a second

1929
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,860
that for instance, in certain
forms of schizophrenia,

1930
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,080
there's elevated dopamine
and where we to just reduce

1931
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,120
the amount of dopamine, that
they would receive relief

1932
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,160
from those schizophrenic symptoms,

1933
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,410
well, that's all pretty
straightforward on the face of it,

1934
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:06,420
but in this situation
with bipolar disorder,

1935
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,160
what we're talking about is hyperactivity,

1936
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,520
too much activity leading to hypoactivity

1937
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,960
through death of those very circuits.

1938
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,800
And so now you can
especially appreciate why

1939
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,080
when the patient shows
up to the psychiatrist

1940
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,820
or when the psychiatrist
shows up to the patient

1941
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,190
in the total course of their disease

1942
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,420
is going to be very important.

1943
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,860
And then layer on top of that

1944
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:26,880
the complexity of the fact

1945
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,800
that the very defining characteristic

1946
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,860
of bipolar disorder is that
there are oscillations in mood.

1947
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,750
So now we need to think about treatments,

1948
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:35,580
not just for the manic episodes,

1949
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,070
but also treatments for
the depressive episodes.

1950
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,380
And that's, in fact,
what psychiatrists do.

1951
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,720
Turns out that they apply
different treatments

1952
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,970
or combinations of treatments for patients

1953
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:47,970
that are in manic episodes
versus depressive episodes

1954
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:51,480
and they have to infer
all that from discussions,

1955
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,160
again, just exchange of words

1956
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,730
depending on when that person
walked into their office,

1957
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:59,460
where they are in terms of manic episodes,

1958
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,070
no symptomology or
depressive symptomology,

1959
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:04,500
and whether or not they've
had that symptomology

1960
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,000
for an extended period of time.

1961
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,640
And then just to make the
situation even more complicated,

1962
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,430
the very circuits that
atrophy that start to wane

1963
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,500
and disappear in people
with bipolar disorder

1964
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,570
are the circuits for interoception,

1965
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:17,790
for understanding of what's
going on in one's own body.

1966
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:20,280
So you can imagine if you
sit down and ask somebody,

1967
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,410
well, how long have, has it been

1968
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,130
since you've slept, that
person may genuinely not know.

1969
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:28,680
Or if you ask the very depressed person,

1970
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,700
how depressed are you?

1971
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,550
That person may not be
able to articulate that.

1972
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,890
So fortunately there are solutions to this

1973
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:38,580
and the solution is that
more often than not,

1974
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,530
the accurate understanding
of whether or not someone

1975
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:43,260
has bipolar depression or not,

1976
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,190
and what stage of the illness
they might be in or not

1977
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:50,310
is going to depend on the
reports of people around them

1978
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,260
and not the patient themselves,

1979
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:55,440
hence the importance of
having a rather detailed

1980
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,570
and admittedly a rather intense discussion

1981
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,880
about the symptomology
of bipolar disorder,

1982
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,100
so that you can have an understanding

1983
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,150
of the people around you
and have an eye and an ear

1984
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,070
to whether or not those
people might be suffering

1985
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:10,680
from bipolar, and if so, at
what stage of the disease

1986
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,970
they might happen to be at.

1987
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,260
Now I'd like to talk a little bit more

1988
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,270
about what is known
about the neural circuits

1989
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,370
that lead to the manic states,

1990
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,630
as well as the depressive states,

1991
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:22,290
but mainly the manic
states of bipolar disorder.

1992
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:25,320
We already discussed the
fact that interception,

1993
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,510
registering of one's own internal emotions

1994
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,490
and bodily states is diminished in people

1995
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:31,140
with bipolar disorder.

1996
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,270
But we haven't really talked
about the neural circuits

1997
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,823
that are responsible for
that lack of recognition.

1998
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,970
For that reason, I'd like
to point out a paper.

1999
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:41,730
This is a fairly recent paper,
just came out this year,

2000
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,530
but it's an excellent one,

2001
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:46,380
Looking at the changes over
time in neural circuitry

2002
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,370
in people with high genetic
risk for bipolar disorder,

2003
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:51,810
and in particular in young people.

2004
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,330
And studies of this sort are rare,

2005
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,670
but are exceedingly
important because of the fact

2006
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,680
that they track individuals over time.

2007
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,060
The title of this paper is,

2008
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,400
Longitudinal Changes in
Structural Connectivity

2009
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,880
in Young People at High Genetic
Risk for Bipolar Disorder.

2010
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,560
We will provide a link to this study

2011
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,210
in the show note captions.

2012
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:12,090
There are a lot of data in this paper,

2013
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:14,820
in particular, neuroimaging data,

2014
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,520
and it's quite extensive
in terms of analyzing

2015
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,560
the so-called connectomics.

2016
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,090
You've probably heard of genomics,

2017
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:24,000
which is the analysis of
genes and their display

2018
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,910
in different individuals or
different animals, et cetera.

2019
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,670
You have proteomics,
which is the display of,

2020
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,170
or the existence of different proteins.

2021
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,270
So omics is a big thing now in science,

2022
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:34,980
you kind of throw omics behind anything

2023
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,320
and it becomes its own Wikipedia page,

2024
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,210
which means it becomes its own thing,

2025
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:42,390
so to speak, I say that
only partially in jest.

2026
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:44,520
Nonetheless, connectomics

2027
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,920
is the analysis of connections

2028
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,130
between different neurons
and neural circuit elements.

2029
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,990
And what this paper really showed

2030
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:54,390
by analyzing the connectomics
of neural circuits

2031
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:57,180
in the brains of many different people

2032
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:01,830
with different categories
of, and onset of,

2033
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:04,470
and severity of

2034
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,430
bipolar disorder,

2035
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:10,173
as well as controls in
different age groups, et cetera,

2036
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,940
is that people who are
of particularly high risk

2037
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:15,983
for having bipolar disorder

2038
01:19:15,983 --> 01:19:19,230
or that have full blown bipolar disorder,

2039
01:19:19,230 --> 01:19:22,260
have deficits and actually reductions

2040
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,090
in the amount of connectivity between

2041
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:25,890
what are called the parietal brain regions

2042
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,210
and the limbic system.

2043
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,800
Now, the limbic system
I've talked about before

2044
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,630
in this podcast, if you're
not familiar with it,

2045
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,910
I'll explain what it is in a moment,

2046
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:34,770
it's simply a collection
of brain structures,

2047
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,820
not one brain structure,

2048
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,740
but a collection of brain structures

2049
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,630
that generally are responsible

2050
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:43,230
for shifting the overall
state that we're in

2051
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:46,350
from states of more relaxed and calm

2052
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,810
to states of more alert and focused.

2053
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:51,990
The limbic system is intimately related

2054
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,940
to the so-called autonomic nervous system,

2055
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:56,070
which regulates our sleep wake cycles

2056
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:59,010
and a number of other things
like our digestion, et cetera,

2057
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,990
our level of hunger and on and on.

2058
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:05,070
So the limbic system is really
kind of like a volume control

2059
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:07,500
or as nerd scientists like to say,

2060
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:11,130
a kind of gain control
on the overall level

2061
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:14,010
or amplitude of alertness or calmness.

2062
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:15,600
In fact, if we're very, very calm,

2063
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,630
we are asleep or even more
calm, we can be in a coma.

2064
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,970
If we are very alert, we can be wide awake

2065
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:22,770
and ready to work and run, et cetera.

2066
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,020
Or if we are very, very, very alert

2067
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:27,540
by way of limbic autonomic interactions,

2068
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,340
well, then we can be in anxiety.

2069
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,110
We can be in full blown panic attack,

2070
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,390
or we can be in mania.

2071
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:35,010
We can have so much energy

2072
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,117
that we feel like we don't need to sleep.

2073
01:20:36,117 --> 01:20:38,790
And in fact, disruptions in the circuitry

2074
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,100
really seems to be what's going on

2075
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,830
in people who have bipolar disorder.

2076
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:46,980
Now, if disruptions in the circuitry

2077
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,300
are present in the limbic system,

2078
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,670
that doesn't necessarily
mean that the limbic system

2079
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:53,130
is at fault because the way
that neural circuits work

2080
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,570
is that different brain areas are talking

2081
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:57,060
to one another through
electrical-chemical signaling,

2082
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,560
and they're regulating one another.

2083
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,050
And what this paper really tells us

2084
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:03,300
is that there are elements
within the parietal lobe,

2085
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,890
which is a kind of a section of the brain

2086
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,210
that sits off to the side,

2087
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,410
it's not really off to the side,

2088
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:10,740
but in neuroanatomical nomenclature,

2089
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:15,740
the parietal lobe is connected
in two ways, bidirectionally.

2090
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:18,180
So parietal lobe is
connecting to limbic system

2091
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,310
and limbic system is
connecting to parietal lobe.

2092
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,990
And in people with bipolar disorder,

2093
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,400
it seems that the parietal lobe

2094
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,580
is able to exert less top down control,

2095
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:29,340
that is less suppression
of certain elements

2096
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:33,300
of the limbic system,
which, at least right now,

2097
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,400
is leading researchers to hypothesize

2098
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,570
that the limbic system is sort
of revving at higher levels.

2099
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:41,250
It's kind of like RPM in your cars

2100
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,850
or kind of redlining at
times and for durations

2101
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:47,250
that are inappropriate
or at least abnormal.

2102
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:51,720
So we have two major sets
of neural circuit deficits

2103
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,610
or changes in people with bipolar.

2104
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,680
Their lack of internal
awareness is reduced,

2105
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,290
and that turns out to be,
by way of neural structures,

2106
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,960
like the insula which is a brain region

2107
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,600
that is connected in a very direct way

2108
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,700
to our somatosensory cortex,

2109
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,280
so the part of our cortex that

2110
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,810
registers how we feel,

2111
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:13,110
literally, sense of
touch and internal state.

2112
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,427
So those circuits, excuse me,

2113
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:16,050
for those for those of you listening

2114
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,330
I just bumped the microphone, excuse me.

2115
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:22,050
Those circuits are disrupted
in people with bipolar

2116
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,270
and the top down control,

2117
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,040
that kind of accelerator and break

2118
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:30,030
on our overall levels of
energy are also disrupted.

2119
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:34,110
Now that's all fine and good
because, well, it's true,

2120
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,730
at least according to what the data

2121
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,350
at this point in time tell us,

2122
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,760
there may be new discoveries to come,

2123
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,620
but that all seems to be the case,

2124
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,330
but it doesn't tell us how to modulate

2125
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:43,980
or change that circuitry.

2126
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:47,250
It also doesn't tell us
how something like lithium

2127
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:50,190
can actually benefit a
large number of patients

2128
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:53,040
or how a good number
of the other treatments

2129
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,980
for bipolar disorder, which
we'll talk about going forward

2130
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,050
can benefit patients with bipolar.

2131
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,460
So it appears that lithium is exerting

2132
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:02,700
its positive effects on
bipolar depression treatment,

2133
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,280
at least in part by preventing the loss

2134
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,300
of certain neural circuits,

2135
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,130
namely the neural
circuits for interoception

2136
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:10,890
and the top down control
over the limbic system.

2137
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:14,160
Now it turns out to be
examining lithium's effects

2138
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,380
at an even more reductionist level,

2139
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,410
we can gain really important
insight into what's going on

2140
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:22,440
in bipolar depression and
some of the other treatments

2141
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,410
for bipolar depression,
including behavioral treatments,

2142
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:27,420
things like transcranial
magnetic stimulation,

2143
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,580
and even some of the more natural

2144
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,770
or so-called nutraceutical treatments

2145
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:35,370
including things like high
dose omega-3 supplementation,

2146
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:37,440
which we're going to
talk about extensively.

2147
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,090
Now, in order to
understand what we're going

2148
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,560
to talk about next, it's important

2149
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,010
that everybody understand a
key concept of neuroplasticity.

2150
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:46,470
And this is a key concept
regardless of whether or not

2151
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:48,450
one is talking about bipolar depression.

2152
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:50,070
In fact, it's something I think everybody,

2153
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:52,560
every citizen of earth should know about,

2154
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,050
and that's called homeostatic plasticity.

2155
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:57,750
Homeostatic plasticity
is a particular form

2156
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,170
of neuroplasticity in
which if a neural circuit

2157
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,500
is overactive for a period of time,

2158
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,500
there are changes that
occur at the cellular level

2159
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,030
that lead to a balance or
a homeostatic regulation

2160
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:15,150
of that circuit so that
it's no longer overactive.

2161
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,060
Conversely, if a neural
circuit is underactive

2162
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,230
for a period of time,

2163
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:22,170
certain changes happen within
the cells of that circuit

2164
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,930
to ramp up their activity
or make them more likely

2165
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:25,860
to be active.

2166
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,900
And whether or not a neural circuit

2167
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,930
and the neurons within
it become more active

2168
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:34,140
or less active in the context
of homeostatic plasticity

2169
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,210
largely depends on one mechanism,

2170
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,950
and it's a beautiful
mechanism that I'll make

2171
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:38,970
very clear to you right now,

2172
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,310
even if you don't have
a background in biology.

2173
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:42,990
Neurons communicate with one another

2174
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,760
by releasing so-called neurotransmitters,

2175
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,780
which are just chemicals.

2176
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,270
Those neurotransmitters are vomited out,

2177
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:49,170
they're not actually vomited,

2178
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,450
but they're spit out into
the so-called synaptic cleft,

2179
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:52,500
often called the synapse.

2180
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,960
The synapse is just a
little gap between neurons.

2181
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,350
And when they are
released into the synapse,

2182
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:59,280
they don't just stay there,

2183
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,830
they actually park or bind to receptors

2184
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,810
on what's called the postsynaptic neuron.

2185
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:07,110
And depending on how many
receptors they bind to

2186
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:09,210
and how many receptors
are available, et cetera,

2187
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,830
they can have a greater or lesser effect

2188
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:12,300
on the postsynaptic neuron.

2189
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,910
This scenario of
neurotransmitters being released

2190
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:17,460
into synapses then binding to receptors

2191
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,860
on postsynaptic neurons and influencing

2192
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,530
the electrical excitability
of those postsynaptic neurons

2193
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:25,710
sits central to not just the
treatment of bipolar disorder,

2194
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,770
but to all treatments of
all psychiatric conditions

2195
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:31,530
and indeed to things like
neuropathic pain as well.

2196
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:34,980
For example, the so-called SSRIs,

2197
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,113
Prozac, Zoloft and others, et cetera,

2198
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:41,280
stands for selective
serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.

2199
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,113
What does that mean?

2200
01:25:42,113 --> 01:25:43,980
Well, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.

2201
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:45,570
It's actually a
neuromodulator that's released

2202
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:48,720
into the synapse, and then the SSRI,

2203
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,360
the selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor

2204
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,870
allows more of that serotonin
to sit within the synapse

2205
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:57,360
for longer, it's a re-uptake inhibitor,

2206
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,087
it prevents re-uptake by
the presynaptic neuron.

2207
01:26:00,087 --> 01:26:02,790
and that serotonin therefore can park in

2208
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:05,147
or dock in the receptors, as it's called,

2209
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:08,070
of the postsynaptic
neuron in greater numbers,

2210
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:11,940
and have a greater impact
on that postsynaptic neuron.

2211
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,340
So the drugs that are
used to treat depression

2212
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,000
or other things of that
sort, things like SSRIs,

2213
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,270
work by changing the
availability of neurotransmitter

2214
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:22,110
in the synapse.

2215
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,390
Other things like MAO inhibitors,

2216
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,480
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
work a different way.

2217
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,680
They inhibit the enzyme.

2218
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,480
Anytime you hear ase in biology,

2219
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,870
it's very likely an enzyme
which breaks things down.

2220
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:38,850
so MAO inhibitors prevent the
breakdown, not the re-uptake,

2221
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:40,920
but the breakdown of neurotransmitter

2222
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,140
and therefore allow more neurotransmitter

2223
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:45,000
to be available in the synapse

2224
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,490
and influence the postsynaptic cell.

2225
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:52,260
Homeostatic plasticity is
a form of neuroplasticity

2226
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:55,770
in which overall circuits can
become much more excitable

2227
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:58,500
or much less excitable by the addition

2228
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,500
of more receptors in
the postsynaptic neuron

2229
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,510
or by the removal of more receptors

2230
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,650
from the postsynaptic neuron.

2231
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,660
And the way this happens
is just beautiful.

2232
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,240
It was first discovered
in the visual system

2233
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,430
and the person primarily responsible

2234
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,290
for the discovery of
homeostatic plasticity,

2235
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:14,460
although there are several,

2236
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,200
is a woman by the name of Gina Turrigiano,

2237
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,420
she's a professor at Brandeis University.

2238
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,390
And what the Turrigiano Laboratory showed

2239
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:24,270
was that for instance, if we

2240
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,820
are in the dark for a long
period of time, literally,

2241
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,830
and we're not seeing much
for a long period of time,

2242
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:31,020
there's an increase in
the number of receptors

2243
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,400
in the postsynaptic neurons

2244
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,550
so that a smaller amount
of light and excitability

2245
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,320
within the visual system can lead

2246
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,470
to greater amounts of
activity in the visual system.

2247
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,810
Conversely, if there's an overactivity

2248
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:45,000
or an increase in that
activity in the visual system

2249
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,650
for some period of time,

2250
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:49,890
then a number of receptors
in the postsynaptic neuron

2251
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:52,920
are removed from that
postsynaptic neuron surface,

2252
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,740
making any neurotransmitter
that's available

2253
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:58,140
only able to bind the
receptors that are left

2254
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,540
and have less of an
influence on those cells.

2255
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,400
In other words, keeping a circuit

2256
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,710
in so-called homeostatic balance

2257
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:07,770
in a particular range of excitability.

2258
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:10,170
Now, while that's a mouthful and an earful

2259
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:11,820
and a concept-full, I don't know

2260
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,740
if a concept-full is a
word, but in any case,

2261
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,150
that's a lot to think about,

2262
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:17,370
but all you need to know
is that if a neural circuit

2263
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:19,050
is very active for a period of time,

2264
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:22,260
in normal individuals,
there will be a reduction

2265
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,780
in the amount of activity
by way of removing

2266
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,550
receptors that bind neurotransmitter.

2267
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:29,280
Whereas, if a neural
circuit is very quiet,

2268
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,780
it's not activated for a period of time,

2269
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,030
maybe your leg is in a cast for instance,

2270
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,910
and you're not activating
your quadricep and calves

2271
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,550
very much, well when that cast comes off,

2272
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,140
sure, the muscle might be atrophied

2273
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,000
but the nerves that connect to that muscle

2274
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,460
are actually in a position
to influence that muscle

2275
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:48,810
even more once you start using
that muscle or those muscles,

2276
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:51,210
because whatever
neurotransmitter is released

2277
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:54,810
now has the opportunity
to bind to more receptors,

2278
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:55,740
in that case in muscle,

2279
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:59,220
or in the case of brain circuits,
in postsynaptic neurons.

2280
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,950
So homeostatic plasticity
is this beautiful,

2281
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,380
balancing mechanism that makes
sure that neural circuits

2282
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:08,250
are never too active nor
too quiet for too long.

2283
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:12,750
And in a beautiful display of how

2284
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,840
treatments can lead to a better
understanding of biology,

2285
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,310
which can lead to the discovery

2286
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:21,510
of even better treatments, lithium and

2287
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:24,690
another compound, which
we'll talk about, ketamine

2288
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:28,080
seem to exert their actions largely

2289
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,440
through effects on
homeostatic neuroplasticity.

2290
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,180
There's a wonderful paper that describes

2291
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,860
all the nitty-gritty of this.

2292
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,170
Certainly most people
listening, I'm guessing,

2293
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,560
are not going to be
interested in all this detail,

2294
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,700
but for those of you that you are

2295
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,590
and you want to delve deep into this,

2296
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:46,080
this paper was published in
Neuron Cell Press journal,

2297
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,670
excellent journal,

2298
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:50,040
it's titled, Targeting
Homeostatic Plasticity

2299
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,690
for the Treatment of Mood Disorders.

2300
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:53,460
And there's one particular
figure in this paper

2301
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,870
that I'll just describe to you

2302
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:58,500
in which measurements
were made from neurons

2303
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,540
and the number of
receptors in those neurons,

2304
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,340
it's done somewhat
indirectly through a method

2305
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,010
that's detailed and
neuroscientists are familiar with.

2306
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:07,830
Basically what it measures is how excited

2307
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:10,560
a given neuron is, electrically
excited a given neuron is

2308
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,440
to a given amount of neurotransmitter.

2309
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,260
So that the amount of
neurotransmitter that's vomited

2310
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,600
onto a neuron is
essentially kept constant,

2311
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,890
and then the response

2312
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,690
of the postsynaptic neuron is measured.

2313
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:24,420
So it can be of one
level or higher or lower

2314
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,390
depending on homeostatic plasticity.

2315
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:30,780
And what this paper shows
and what's been shown

2316
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:35,460
over and over again, is that
when neurons are exposed

2317
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,680
to lithium for a period of time,

2318
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:41,670
there is a reduction in the excitability

2319
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:44,850
of the postsynaptic neuron,
that is neurons within the brain

2320
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:49,850
become less excitable over
time if lithium is present,

2321
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:53,850
whereas ketamine, which is
now a common FDA-approved,

2322
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:56,280
at least in the US, it's
approved for the treatment

2323
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,250
of major depression,
ketamine does the opposite.

2324
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,680
Ketamine seems to increase
the number of receptors

2325
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:05,280
in the postsynaptic neuron
and lead to greater levels

2326
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,320
of excitability and electrical activity

2327
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,990
within neural circuits
to a given fixed amount

2328
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:11,340
of neurotransmitter.

2329
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,290
So this is super interesting
because what it means

2330
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:16,560
is that lithium is causing
circuits to be less active,

2331
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,170
ketamine is causing
circuits to be more active.

2332
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:22,170
And we know from excellent
clinical data now

2333
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:25,410
that ketamine seems to be
a very effective treatment

2334
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:30,300
for major depression, and for
the major depressive episodes

2335
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:33,090
of people that suffer
from bipolar depression,

2336
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:35,040
that includes these
major depressive episodes

2337
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,100
of two weeks or longer of
suppressed mood, appetite,

2338
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,870
sleep issues, et cetera.

2339
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,090
Now, the key thing about ketamine

2340
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:45,570
that's often not discussed
is that while its effects

2341
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:48,840
are very potent, they are transient.

2342
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,830
So one major drawback to
ketamine therapy for depression

2343
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:54,600
is that it has to be done repeatedly,

2344
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,450
and how repeatedly, or how often, rather,

2345
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,220
depends, of course, on a discussion

2346
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,930
between the psychiatrist and the patient.

2347
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:04,530
This is not something
to cowboy on your own.

2348
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:07,050
I know that, and many of
you are probably familiar

2349
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:11,190
with the fact that ketamine
also is abused recreationally.

2350
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:13,080
It is a so-called NMDA,

2351
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:16,050
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist,

2352
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:18,780
so it blocks the very
receptor that's responsible

2353
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,690
for neuroplasticity for
changes in neural circuits.

2354
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:24,180
It also changes excitability
in neurons as I just described.

2355
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,310
So ketamine is a very potent chemical

2356
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,467
that has been shown over and over again

2357
01:32:28,467 --> 01:32:30,570
and is now FDA approved for the treatment

2358
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:33,630
of major depression, but its
effects seem to be transient.

2359
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:35,550
Lithium, as I described earlier,

2360
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:39,540
seems to reduce the manic episodes

2361
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:41,600
or the intensity of manic
episodes in symptomology,

2362
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,290
in people with bipolar disorder,

2363
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:45,150
it's doing that through neuroprotection.

2364
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:47,340
So protecting neural
circuits from dying away

2365
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:48,990
that initially are overactive

2366
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:51,510
and that overactivity
causing excitotoxicity,

2367
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,450
blocks that excitotoxicity, we believe.

2368
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:58,200
And it seems to do that in part

2369
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,470
by diminishing the amount of
activity in those circuits.

2370
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:04,080
So this is a beautiful mechanistic story,

2371
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,330
and it's the sort of story
that you'd love to have

2372
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:08,820
for a great number of
psychiatric illnesses.

2373
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,950
And fortunately we have
for bipolar disorder.

2374
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:12,390
Overactivity of a given circuit

2375
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:16,440
eventually leads to
neurotoxicity, excuse me,

2376
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,230
lithium is preventing that
neurotoxicity by reducing

2377
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:21,450
the number of receptors
in certain elements

2378
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:24,360
within those circuits, so
called homeostatic scaling,

2379
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,820
it's downregulating
the number of receptors

2380
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:28,950
leading to less
excitability and preventing,

2381
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:31,020
we think, excitotoxicity.

2382
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:35,010
And in that sense, you can see exactly why

2383
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:36,450
it's important to get lithium treatment

2384
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,850
in there early for people
with bipolar disorder.

2385
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,580
Ketamine as a treatment
for major depression

2386
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,590
seems to be effective but transient.

2387
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:45,720
And you can also see why
it would be important,

2388
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,209
not just to reduce the manic episodes

2389
01:33:48,209 --> 01:33:49,830
for people with bipolar disorder,

2390
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:52,170
but to also treat the depressive episodes.

2391
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:53,850
So this is a key feature of the treatment

2392
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:56,880
for bipolar depression
and for bipolar disorder.

2393
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,070
there needs to be
treatment both of the mania

2394
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:01,680
and of the depressive
episodes if they're present.

2395
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:04,530
And fortunately, there are
excellent drugs to do that.

2396
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:07,440
And I should mention
that ketamine and lithium

2397
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,380
are just two of the drugs within the kit

2398
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:12,390
that psychiatrists have access to.

2399
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:15,057
There are many things, olanzapines

2400
01:34:15,057 --> 01:34:18,270
and a number of different,
including Clozapine.

2401
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,280
Clozapine is an antipsychotic

2402
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,920
which is commonly prescribed to

2403
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,530
as a sedative in some
cases that allows people

2404
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:26,820
in manic episodes to sleep.

2405
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,410
It's classically described

2406
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:31,230
as so called dopamine
receptor 4 antagonist,

2407
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:32,880
although it does other things as well.

2408
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,790
Clozapine has a number
of side effect features

2409
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:38,100
related to white blood cell

2410
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,620
and things of that sort that
require careful monitoring.

2411
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:44,160
So there are an enormous number now,

2412
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,710
literally dozens and
dozens of different drugs,

2413
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:49,860
each designed to target
either the manic phase,

2414
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:53,700
the depressive phase, or
some what we call acute

2415
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,250
sort of early phases
versus ongoing treatments.

2416
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:59,400
This is a vast galaxy of drug treatments

2417
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,440
that really should be navigated,

2418
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,780
I should say, absolutely
should be navigated

2419
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,300
by a board certified psychiatrist.

2420
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,700
And of course in close discussion

2421
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:11,820
with both the person suffering
from bipolar disorder,

2422
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:14,370
but also ideally the family members

2423
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:16,800
of the person suffering
from bipolar disorder.

2424
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,950
But I think, at least up until now,

2425
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:23,400
we've focused on the two major pathways

2426
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,710
for treatment, lithium and ketamine.

2427
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:28,380
And we've talked about why
lithium and ketamine work,

2428
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,700
that they're working on opposite ends

2429
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:30,900
of this homeostatic scaling.

2430
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:33,570
We talked a bit about the
circuits that are involved

2431
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,280
in generating what we think

2432
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,340
are the manic symptomology
and the lack of interception.

2433
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:40,440
Why people can just
persist in staying awake,

2434
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,050
awake, awake, not eating, et cetera.

2435
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:45,960
Now you have in mind how
all that is put together.

2436
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,400
And I think you have in mind,

2437
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,920
some of the well-demonstrated treatments

2438
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,620
for the different component
parts of bipolar disorder,

2439
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,690
which now I'm hoping
you're also well versed in

2440
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:57,150
based on our early, early discussion

2441
01:35:57,150 --> 01:36:00,030
of what constitutes
bipolar 1 and bipolar 2.

2442
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,220
Now I would like to also talk about

2443
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:04,920
some of the not so typical therapeutics

2444
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,950
for bipolar disorder and
also point to the things

2445
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:10,290
that have been tried and failed

2446
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:12,750
for successful treatment
of bipolar disorder,

2447
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:15,090
because some of those things

2448
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:17,520
are often talked about and suggested,

2449
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,230
especially in online communities,

2450
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:21,210
and while it's not clear that any of them

2451
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:24,300
are particularly hazardous on their own,

2452
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,940
although some of them
do carry some hazards,

2453
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,700
I do think it's important
because of the critical

2454
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,770
time sensitive nature of bipolar disorder

2455
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:34,770
and the urgency of
getting treatments early

2456
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:36,930
to try and prevent some
of the longer lasting

2457
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:39,600
neural circuit changes
that if people can avoid

2458
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,400
some of the less effective or demonstrated

2459
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,860
to be ineffective treatments,

2460
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:46,410
that they stand to combat bipolar disorder

2461
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,580
much more successfully.

2462
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:50,070
First of all, a key point
about drug therapies

2463
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:53,223
versus non-drug therapies
or talk therapies,

2464
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,360
without question, drug therapies

2465
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,160
are going to be most effective

2466
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:02,040
when done also with talk therapies.

2467
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,390
And we'll talk about which talk therapies

2468
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:06,180
have been demonstrated
to be most effective.

2469
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,550
There is some argument about
what I'm about to say next,

2470
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:12,000
but in general, most
psychiatrists will tell you,

2471
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,910
or certainly the ones I've
spoken to have told me,

2472
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:17,460
that talk therapy on its own

2473
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:22,380
is rarely, if ever effective
for bipolar depression

2474
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,680
and bipolar disorder, whether
or not it's BP-I or BP-II.

2475
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,390
That's just the reality of it.

2476
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:29,100
Contrast that with our discussion

2477
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,780
about obsessive-compulsive disorder,

2478
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:32,700
which we talked about a few episodes ago,

2479
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,290
if you haven't seen that episode,

2480
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:36,600
We have an in-depth episode all about OCD

2481
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,450
and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

2482
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:42,630
There it seems that drug
therapies and talk therapies

2483
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:45,720
can be done independently
or in combination.

2484
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:49,140
As expected, combined
drug and talk therapies

2485
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,300
are more effective there
than either one alone,

2486
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,520
but there are pretty impressive effects

2487
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,900
of talk therapy alone provided

2488
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,310
that they're initiated at the right time,

2489
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,530
and it's the right form of talk therapy.

2490
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:01,380
That's OCD, but in terms
of bipolar disorder,

2491
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:04,860
it really seems that the
drug therapies are necessary,

2492
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,920
at least in most all cases.

2493
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,000
That said, talk therapies
are terrific augment

2494
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,590
or support for those drug therapies

2495
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,730
and sometimes can allow people

2496
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:16,680
to take lower doses of
those drug therapies,

2497
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,850
which turns out to be important

2498
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,340
because of the side
effect profiles of a lot

2499
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:22,050
of drug therapies and
sometimes the cost as well.

2500
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:22,980
I guess we can think of cost

2501
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,730
just as another side effect really.

2502
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:28,770
There are both established
and more novel forms

2503
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:31,530
of talk therapy being used, again,

2504
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:34,180
in concert with drug treatments
for bipolar disorder.

2505
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,530
Cognitive behavioral therapy is the one

2506
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,730
that seems to be best,

2507
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,670
at least by way of the
statistics and papers that exist.

2508
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,350
It's also the one that's
been explored the most.

2509
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,450
So one of the reasons
why it's often considered

2510
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:46,680
the most popular or effective

2511
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,120
is 'cause it's also been around longer

2512
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,080
and it's been explored the most.

2513
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,840
Cognitive behavioral therapy in general

2514
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,470
is a progressive exposure of the patient

2515
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:57,480
in a very controlled way,
in a clinical setting,

2516
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,210
to some of the triggers or the conditions

2517
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:02,790
that would exacerbate bipolar disorder.

2518
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:05,400
Now, earlier I said borderline
personality disorder

2519
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,890
has all these triggers
and triggered elements

2520
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:08,940
from the external environment,

2521
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,890
whereas bipolar disorder does not.

2522
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:13,240
And that's still true, but

2523
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,800
it is the case that somebody with bipolar

2524
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,470
can have worse symptoms if life conditions

2525
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:20,520
get worse or more stressful.

2526
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,560
So cognitive behavioral therapy,

2527
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,120
I mean the discussion about

2528
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,230
and sometimes the direct exposure to

2529
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,340
anxiety provoking elements of life

2530
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,720
can be very helpful for
adjusting the responses

2531
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,400
to those otherwise triggering events

2532
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,870
and sometimes making the drug treatments

2533
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,610
more effective even at lower doses.

2534
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:40,470
There are also forms of therapy

2535
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,780
including family-focused therapy,

2536
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:45,360
which is especially important in terms

2537
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,990
of bipolar disorder because

2538
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:51,330
family members, provided
that they are not themselves

2539
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:52,818
in a manic episode due to the

2540
01:39:52,818 --> 01:39:55,830
close heritability of bipolar disorder,

2541
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:59,640
but family members can
often be excellent windows

2542
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,760
into whether or not somebody
is doing well or poorly,

2543
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,250
or is veering toward or is emerging from

2544
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:06,930
a manic or depressive episode

2545
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,190
because they understand that person,

2546
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:09,750
they have a lot of data,

2547
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:11,190
it could be purely subjective data,

2548
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:12,930
but they have a lot of
exposure to how long

2549
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:15,390
or well somebody's been
sleeping or eating, et cetera.

2550
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:17,400
So family-focused therapy
involves other members

2551
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,250
of the person suffering from
bipolar disorder's family,

2552
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:24,090
as well as conversations
about family members

2553
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:25,770
in a way that helps patients

2554
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,600
with bipolar disorder navigate,

2555
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,790
not just through manic episodes
and depressive episodes,

2556
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:32,880
but start to learn to predict
what are the conditions

2557
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,070
psychological, physical, and otherwise

2558
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:38,100
that can trigger bipolar episodes.

2559
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:41,040
And then there's a category of therapy

2560
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,070
called interpersonal and
social rhythm therapy.

2561
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:48,240
This is deserving of its
own entire episode really.

2562
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,980
Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy,

2563
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:53,010
it's sort of an expansion
on family-focused therapy,

2564
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:55,350
although it's distinct
in certain ways as well,

2565
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:59,190
and really focuses on how
people are relating to others

2566
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:01,410
in their life, and in the workplace,

2567
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:03,000
and in the school environment,

2568
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,980
and also within the family, et cetera.

2569
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:07,890
And I should say that a overall theme

2570
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:10,470
that's emerging in
psychiatry and psychology

2571
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:13,560
is to start wherever
possible to incorporate

2572
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,510
more of the social aspects

2573
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:17,070
and the interpersonal aspects.

2574
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,720
In other words, not just talking to

2575
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,450
and examining a patient
as one biological system,

2576
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:24,570
one nervous system, one set
of chemicals, and one life,

2577
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:27,030
but rather a set of
chemicals, neural circuits,

2578
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:28,950
and a life that's
embedded in the chemicals

2579
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:31,324
and neural circuits and
lives of other people.

2580
01:41:31,324 --> 01:41:33,240
Just by way of example, you can imagine

2581
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,940
that if somebody is in a
very healthy relationship

2582
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:37,830
or a very abusive relationship,

2583
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:39,900
that that's going to strongly impact

2584
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,730
the outcomes of manic episodes.

2585
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:44,400
You can imagine that if
the financial situation

2586
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,580
is one in which people can
recover from manic episodes,

2587
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,590
I didn't mention this
earlier, but I should have,

2588
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:51,450
forgive me, that oftentimes people

2589
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:53,040
who are in a manic episode will go out

2590
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,780
and spend immense amounts of money

2591
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,970
that they simply cannot afford to lose.

2592
01:41:56,970 --> 01:42:00,120
And then the depressive
episodes that, in many cases,

2593
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:05,100
follow are made far worse
by the financial anxiety

2594
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,260
and the financial stress that results

2595
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,480
from those manic episodes
of spending, et cetera.

2596
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,130
And then of course, this carries over

2597
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:14,760
to sexual promiscuity where
people might be dealing

2598
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,470
with unwanted pregnancy or STIs, or

2599
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,760
very fractured interpersonal dynamics

2600
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,350
with existing or new relationships.

2601
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:25,980
I mean, you can imagine
how these manic episodes,

2602
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,630
as well as the depressive episodes

2603
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:31,080
can really wick out into an
enormous amount of destruction,

2604
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,140
which brings us back
to the initial criteria

2605
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:37,350
of BP-1 and BP-2 is that
these manic episodes

2606
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:39,150
are not a good thing.

2607
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:41,523
These depressive episodes
are not a good thing.

2608
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,640
They create this sense of euphoria

2609
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,220
in the person experiencing mania,

2610
01:42:46,220 --> 01:42:48,870
or they create this sense
that anything is possible.

2611
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:52,410
But at the end of the day,
and actually every day,

2612
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:54,720
these episodes are quite maladaptive.

2613
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,430
They really destroy people's lives.

2614
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:58,020
And it's not just the life of the person

2615
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:59,217
that's suffering from bipolar disorder.

2616
01:42:59,217 --> 01:43:01,710
And so hence cognitive behavioral therapy,

2617
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,600
family-focused therapy and interpersonal

2618
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,520
and social rhythm
therapies are the primary

2619
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,400
three talk therapies that
are most often combined

2620
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,410
with drug therapies in order to try

2621
01:43:10,410 --> 01:43:12,870
and really reduce the harm.

2622
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:15,780
It's really all about harm reduction

2623
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,270
from manic episodes and
depressive episodes.

2624
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:20,220
One very exciting and emerging treatment

2625
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:22,560
that does show great promise,

2626
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,600
and in some cases, great outcomes,

2627
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,480
for bipolar disorder is, believe it or not

2628
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,190
electric shock therapy.

2629
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:31,260
Electric shock therapy may sound barbaric,

2630
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,270
and in fact, it tends to look barbaric,

2631
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:34,920
although this is done in
the controlled setting

2632
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:35,760
of a hospital.

2633
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,490
If any of you have seen One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,

2634
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:41,670
the final scene or near
final scene in that movie

2635
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:45,360
was Jack Nicholson with
the sort of bite protector

2636
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,580
in his mouth and getting
electric shock therapy,

2637
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:52,020
and it's as the name suggests,
it's a kind of inducing

2638
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:57,020
a global seizure, either low
level or grand mal type seizure

2639
01:43:57,090 --> 01:43:59,760
in the patient's brain and nervous system.

2640
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,610
You might ask, well, why
would one want to do that?

2641
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:06,030
Well, it turns out that
this is a well-established,

2642
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:08,400
and in many cases, very
effective treatment

2643
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:09,630
for major depression.

2644
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:12,450
Electric shock therapy is generally used

2645
01:44:12,450 --> 01:44:14,340
for treatment-resistant depression.

2646
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:17,640
So these are people that
have no positive response

2647
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,640
or ongoing positive
response to drug therapies

2648
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:20,850
or other therapies.

2649
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:23,070
Electric shock therapy is thought to work

2650
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:26,400
primarily by stimulating the massive kind

2651
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,080
of indiscriminate release of things

2652
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,260
like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,

2653
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,840
a huge variety of neuromodulators,

2654
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,580
as well as things like BDNF,

2655
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:36,810
brain-derived neurotrophic factor

2656
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:39,300
which then allows
neuroplasticity to take place.

2657
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:42,300
Again, BDNF being permissive
for neuroplasticity.

2658
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:45,180
The problem with ECT is
that it's really only useful

2659
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:47,160
for treatment-resistant depression,

2660
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,470
it doesn't actually
target the manic aspects

2661
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:52,380
of bipolar depression
and bipolar disorder,

2662
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:56,010
but nonetheless, is used when
drug treatments don't work.

2663
01:44:56,010 --> 01:44:59,570
Some of the negatives of
electric shock therapy

2664
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:02,520
or electric convulsive therapy, ECT,

2665
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,190
is the proper acronym
and way it's described

2666
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,660
is that it's quite invasive, right?

2667
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:09,090
This is something that you
need to go to the hospital for

2668
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:11,520
and oftentimes there's some
inpatient care required

2669
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,070
after the electric convulsive therapy.

2670
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:15,390
It's a fairly high cost,

2671
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:17,790
especially for those that
don't have insurance.

2672
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:20,100
And of course it requires anesthesia.

2673
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,600
For most people, that's
not going to be a problem,

2674
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,690
but for many people
that could be a problem.

2675
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:28,350
And there's often some
associated memory loss.

2676
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:33,350
And so the memory loss,
the invasive nature of ECT

2677
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:37,620
and the cost oftentimes rule
out ECT for most patients,

2678
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,210
and that's why it's sort of a late stage

2679
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:41,100
or kind of last resort type thing

2680
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,750
for treatment-resistant depression.

2681
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:45,570
Nowadays ketamine type
therapy is done repeatedly

2682
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:47,580
or other treatments, for instance,

2683
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,130
transcranial magnetic stimulation

2684
01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:52,110
which is basically non-invasive,

2685
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:53,940
it's a coil that's placed on the outside

2686
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:55,833
of the skull, excuse me.

2687
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:59,760
And we can more accurately refer to it

2688
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,280
as repetitive or rTMS,

2689
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,890
repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

2690
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:07,650
Transcranial magnetic
stimulation is a tool

2691
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:09,690
that allows researchers and clinicians

2692
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:11,280
to reduce the amount of activity

2693
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,510
in specific neural circuits.

2694
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:15,180
So they can actually
target the magnetic field

2695
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:17,100
to particular neural
circuits to reduce activity

2696
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:18,360
in those neural circuits.

2697
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,010
Again, it's minimally invasive.

2698
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:21,690
It has been shown to be effective

2699
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:25,470
in both increasing
neuroplasticity in positive ways,

2700
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:27,570
as well as reducing depressive episodes

2701
01:46:27,570 --> 01:46:30,690
and in a few instances in reducing

2702
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:33,630
the amplitude or the
intensity of manic episodes

2703
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,730
in people with bipolar disorder.

2704
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:39,060
The problem is it's still
a very early technique.

2705
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,100
There aren't a lot of
clinics and labs doing it.

2706
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:42,930
I'm starting to see more advertisements,

2707
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:45,210
literally commercial clinics

2708
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:48,120
that are advertising rTMS or TMS.

2709
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,610
I encourage you to approach
those clinics with caution.

2710
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:53,370
I'm of the mind that if those clinics

2711
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:56,460
are not either closely
or maybe even distantly

2712
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,200
associated with a research institution

2713
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,600
that's really up on the latest of rTMS,

2714
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,390
you'd be wise to at
least do your research,

2715
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,910
and explore, talk to other patients

2716
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:07,380
who've done these treatments,

2717
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:09,540
but certainly in university hospitals

2718
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,610
and in clinical settings
and research settings,

2719
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:15,180
rTMS is being used as
a way to, for instance,

2720
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,760
reduce the activity of
certain limbic circuitries

2721
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,460
so that people are just overall
less excitable and manic

2722
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:23,340
or to activate because it can also be used

2723
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,020
for activation now of
certain neural circuits.

2724
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:27,180
Activate, for instance,
the parietal inputs,

2725
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:29,190
the top down control
over the limbic system.

2726
01:47:29,190 --> 01:47:30,960
This is all happening right now.

2727
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,920
So we have ECT, repetitive TMS or rTMS,

2728
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,990
and then as I mentioned
earlier, ketamine therapies,

2729
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:39,780
most of those are targeted
toward the depressive aspects

2730
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:41,400
of manic depression.

2731
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,960
So for people with bipolar disorder

2732
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,310
that doesn't include depression,

2733
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:45,930
those are going to be less effective,

2734
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:48,350
but overall, it's going
to be the talk therapies

2735
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:51,930
of the sort that we discussed
earlier, or a moment ago.

2736
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:54,570
Plus drug treatments,

2737
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:56,280
almost always lithium will be explored,

2738
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,950
plus some treatments for
the depressive episodes

2739
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:01,890
in particular if those
depressive episodes are present.

2740
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:04,980
Nowadays, there's a lot of
excitement about psilocybin

2741
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:06,330
which is a psychedelic.

2742
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:09,150
In the US, psilocybin is still illegal.

2743
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:12,930
It is not legal, meaning you
can get in a lot of trouble

2744
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:15,840
for possessing it, certainly
for selling it, et cetera.

2745
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,430
But psilocybin is being explored

2746
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:20,010
as a clinical therapy in
certain laboratory settings

2747
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,650
in particular, at Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine.

2748
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:24,240
It's being explored in human patients

2749
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,770
for the treatment of major depression,

2750
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:28,440
for OCD I believe as well,

2751
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:31,200
but certainly for major depression
and for eating disorders.

2752
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,320
And it seems from the
initial wave of publications

2753
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,860
from that work done by the
incredible Matthew Johnson

2754
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,630
or Dr. Matthew Johnson, who was a guest

2755
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:40,620
on this podcast before,

2756
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:43,320
he's also been on the Tim Ferris Podcast,

2757
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,570
he's been on the Lex Fridman Podcast.

2758
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:48,120
Dr. Matthew Johnson came on this podcast,

2759
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,050
he's talked about some of the work

2760
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,630
with psilocybin for the
treatment of depression.

2761
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:54,090
Very impressive results there.

2762
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:56,280
And as you can imagine,
very impressive results

2763
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,500
for the major depressive
episodes for bipolar.

2764
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,080
However, at least to my knowledge,

2765
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,580
again, to my knowledge,

2766
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,950
there have not been any
controlled clinical trials

2767
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:07,950
exploring psilocybin
for the mania associated

2768
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:08,970
with bipolar disorder.

2769
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:11,310
If someone out there is aware
of those clinical trials,

2770
01:49:11,310 --> 01:49:12,143
please let me know.

2771
01:49:12,143 --> 01:49:13,950
I'll do an update in a future podcast,

2772
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:16,920
but right now, no knowledge from me

2773
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:18,660
about psilocybin clinical trials

2774
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:22,350
for the manic component
of bipolar disorder.

2775
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:24,420
A number of people are
probably also going to wonder

2776
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,670
about whether or not cannabis

2777
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:31,020
or medical marijuana is
useful for bipolar disorder.

2778
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:34,230
To address this, I looked
to some previous lectures

2779
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:37,590
and some clinicians at
Stanford Psychiatry.

2780
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:40,980
This question was asked of
them, and as it turns out,

2781
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:43,410
cannabis does not seem to be effective

2782
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:45,450
for the treatment of the manic phases

2783
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:48,060
of bipolar disorder or for the treatment

2784
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:50,340
of the major depressive component.

2785
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,740
The only treatment perhaps,

2786
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:55,140
or I should say the only situation perhaps

2787
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:55,973
in which it might be useful,

2788
01:49:55,973 --> 01:49:57,720
and this is what was relayed to me,

2789
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,600
is that it may help with
sleep in certain people

2790
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,480
that are having trouble with insomnia,

2791
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:06,090
though nowadays, it's far
more common for people

2792
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:07,980
in manic episodes to be prescribed things

2793
01:50:07,980 --> 01:50:11,760
like Trazodone or other
benzos, benzodiazepines

2794
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,170
in order to try and get sleep

2795
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:14,340
within the manic episodes.

2796
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:16,980
And benzodiazepines and
Trazodone, et cetera,

2797
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:19,230
work largely through the
so-called GABA system.

2798
01:50:19,230 --> 01:50:21,240
This is a neurotransmitter

2799
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:25,140
that causes reductions in
excitability of neurons,

2800
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:27,780
hence why it's being used
to try and calm people down

2801
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:29,880
and allow them to sleep
during their manic episodes.

2802
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:32,010
So not a lot, or essentially no data,

2803
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:33,750
supporting the use of
cannabis for the treatment

2804
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,790
of bipolar disorder, per se,

2805
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:38,490
nor data supporting the use of psilocybin

2806
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:40,440
for the treatment of
bipolar disorder per se.

2807
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,050
But I realize, as I say that,

2808
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:44,430
that there are going to
be a number of people

2809
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:48,360
that may have had positive
or negative experiences

2810
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,560
with cannabis or psilocybin

2811
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,000
as they relate to bipolar disorder.

2812
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,820
So please, if you're
willing or comfortable,

2813
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:54,960
put that, if you're comfortable,

2814
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,660
into the comment section on YouTube.

2815
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,640
And of course, if you
are aware of any studies

2816
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:03,060
on cannabis or psilocybin
showing positive outcomes

2817
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:06,210
for the treatment bipolar
disorder, please provide links

2818
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:09,160
or PubMed ideas to those, I'd
love to peruse those studies.

2819
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,260
There are two naturopathic,
or I should say,

2820
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:17,070
nutrition, supplement-based
approaches to bipolar disorder.

2821
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:20,670
They get talked about a
lot, and one of them shows

2822
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:23,520
some interesting promise,
or effectiveness even,

2823
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,190
in a limited context.

2824
01:51:26,190 --> 01:51:28,260
Before marching into this description

2825
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:31,200
of these two compounds, in
fact before even mentioning

2826
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,230
these two compounds,
I do want to emphasize

2827
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:37,500
what's been said and written
about over and over again

2828
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:41,103
and what was relayed to me
from expert psychiatrists.

2829
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:45,720
It is not wise to rely
purely on talk therapy

2830
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:48,590
or on natural approaches to the treatment

2831
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:52,680
of bipolar disorder given
the intensity of the disorder

2832
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:56,250
and the high propensity for suicide risk

2833
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,810
in people with bipolar disorder,

2834
01:51:57,810 --> 01:52:00,570
it is a chemical and
neural circuit disruption,

2835
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:02,250
and it needs to be dealt with head on

2836
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:05,010
through the appropriate chemistry

2837
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:06,870
and prescription drug approaches

2838
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:09,090
from a board-certified psychiatrist.

2839
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:11,310
I don't say this to protect me,

2840
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:14,760
I say this truly to protect
those who either suffer from

2841
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,550
or think they may suffer
from bipolar disorder

2842
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:18,750
or if you know someone
who you think might suffer

2843
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,983
from a bipolar disorder.

2844
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,590
Now, all that is not to say

2845
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:24,930
that there aren't useful
lifestyle interventions

2846
01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:26,820
that can support people
with bipolar disorder.

2847
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,470
So I just briefly want to mention those.

2848
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:30,990
And again, I'm lifting the
statements I'm about to make

2849
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:33,780
from some excellent online lectures

2850
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,480
from psychiatrists at
Stanford and elsewhere,

2851
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,760
which essentially say that,

2852
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:41,940
of course, of course, of course,

2853
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:45,090
getting better sleep,
getting adequate exercise,

2854
01:52:45,090 --> 01:52:48,030
getting proper nutrition, having quality,

2855
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:50,580
healthy, social interactions,

2856
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:52,410
even getting regular sunlight in the day

2857
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:53,700
and avoiding bright light at night,

2858
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:57,000
all of those things are
going to braid together

2859
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,640
to support the nervous
system and the psyche

2860
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:01,993
of somebody with bipolar disorder,

2861
01:53:01,993 --> 01:53:04,860
but they braid together
to support the psyche

2862
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:06,480
and the neurochemistry
and the neural circuits

2863
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,370
of anybody and everybody.

2864
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:11,220
So they have generally a modulatory effect

2865
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:14,220
that is they're indirectly shifting

2866
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:17,190
the likelihood that somebody
might have an episode,

2867
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:19,260
or the intensity of an episode,

2868
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:21,150
in particular, the depressive episodes.

2869
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:22,380
You can imagine how someone who's heading

2870
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:23,790
into a depressive episode,

2871
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:25,560
maybe they're on a lower
amount of medication

2872
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,150
or they haven't yet medicated

2873
01:53:27,150 --> 01:53:29,190
for the depressive episode of bipolar.

2874
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:32,490
And now they're making sure
or their family is making sure

2875
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:34,050
that they're getting exercise, sunshine,

2876
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:36,780
eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera.

2877
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,100
Of course it makes perfect sense

2878
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,650
why they would have
perhaps a shallower drop

2879
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,390
into depression or maybe an offset

2880
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:43,920
of depressive episode.

2881
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,520
That said, most all, if not all people

2882
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,860
with bipolar disorder are likely to need

2883
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:52,620
some sort of drug therapy intervention

2884
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:53,880
in order to help them.

2885
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:56,820
So lifestyle factors are always important

2886
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,290
in all individuals,

2887
01:53:58,290 --> 01:54:01,383
those suffering from
psychiatric conditions or not.

2888
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:05,460
But in some conditions
of the mind and body,

2889
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:08,130
those lifestyle interventions
can have a greater effect

2890
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:11,250
in offsetting symptoms,
whereas in bipolar disorder,

2891
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:13,860
I think it's naive, and
in fact, wrong to say

2892
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:16,320
that lifestyle interventions alone

2893
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,810
are going to prevent,
especially the extreme forms

2894
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,610
of mania and depression.

2895
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:23,130
Again, bipolar disorder being so serious

2896
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:25,440
and carrying such high suicide risk,

2897
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,510
we just have to point
this out again and again.

2898
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:29,730
Now with that said,
there are two substances

2899
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:31,830
generally found as supplements,

2900
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:33,780
although there are other
sources of them as well,

2901
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:35,940
including within nutritional sources

2902
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:38,340
that have been shown, at
least in some studies,

2903
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:42,350
to be pretty effective
in adjusting the symptoms

2904
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:46,170
of bipolar disorder, and
those two things are inositol

2905
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:48,750
and omega-3 fatty acids.

2906
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:51,660
Now inositol is a compound

2907
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,400
that is taken for a variety of reasons.

2908
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,440
It's something we've talked
about on the podcast before.

2909
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,180
I personally take inositol not because

2910
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,580
I have bipolar disorder,
in fact I am quite lucky

2911
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:02,130
that I don't have bipolar disorder,

2912
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:05,220
but I take inositol, a 900
milligrams of myo-inositol

2913
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:07,800
every third night or so in
order to improve my sleep.

2914
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,660
It's something that I've
added to my sleep stack.

2915
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,390
It's something that I
found greatly enhances

2916
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:14,490
the depth and quality of my sleep.

2917
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:16,110
And if I wake up in
the middle of the night

2918
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:17,370
to use the bathroom, et cetera,

2919
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:20,610
it's greatly enhanced my
ability to fall back asleep

2920
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:22,020
when I want to go back to sleep.

2921
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:24,240
It also seems to have a fairly potent

2922
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:26,790
anti-anxiety effect during the day.

2923
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:29,190
And as I discussed in our episode

2924
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:30,840
about obsessive-compulsive disorder,

2925
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:34,020
inositol has been used at high dosages,

2926
01:55:34,020 --> 01:55:35,850
again, I should say
myo-inositol has been used

2927
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:40,290
at high dosages, at levels
of even 10, 18 grams,

2928
01:55:40,290 --> 01:55:42,420
those are massive dosages by the way,

2929
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:46,680
to deal with certain symptoms
of OCD to limited success.

2930
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:50,160
And I should mention that
high dosages of 10 or 18 grams

2931
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,350
of inositol can cause a lot

2932
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:54,450
of gastric discomfort, et cetera.

2933
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:57,240
If you want to learn more about inositol

2934
01:55:57,240 --> 01:56:00,930
and its various uses, I encourage
you to go to examine.com

2935
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:03,540
where there's the so-called
Human Effect Matrix,

2936
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,630
and that Human Effects
Matrix will describe the many

2937
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:09,990
places in which myo-inositol
and other forms of inositol

2938
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:11,880
have been show shown to be effective

2939
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,440
in, for instance, reducing anxiety,

2940
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,780
enhancing sleep and on and on.

2941
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,350
Myo-inositol is important
because myo-inositol,

2942
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:21,420
and we can just say inositol,

2943
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:24,150
is related to so-called
second messenger pathways.

2944
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:26,250
I don't want to get too deep
into second messenger pathways,

2945
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:29,670
but when certain substances
bind, like neurotransmitters

2946
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:31,650
to a receptor on a cell surface,

2947
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:34,170
oftentimes those receptors
themselves will open

2948
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:37,260
and allow the passage of ions
and other things into a cell.

2949
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,210
Oftentimes they will engage

2950
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,010
what are called second messenger systems

2951
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:43,860
that is they will trigger
mechanisms within the cell

2952
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:45,480
to then go do other things.

2953
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,040
This is probably something
we should get into

2954
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,750
in real detail in a future episode

2955
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:50,400
for those of you that
really want to nerd out

2956
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:53,430
on cell-cell signaling, which
is a favorite topic of mine.

2957
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:56,040
In any case, inositol is related

2958
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,380
to a number of so-called
second messenger systems,

2959
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:01,410
this handoff, or this kind of stimulating

2960
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:05,520
of changes within a cell
that can inspire changes

2961
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,590
in what's called membrane fluidity,

2962
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:10,350
can actually make the membranes of cells,

2963
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,840
the outside fence around a cell,

2964
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,613
which is made up of fatty stuff,

2965
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:17,550
it can change the fluidity,

2966
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:20,430
meaning how readily things can float

2967
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:21,510
around in the membrane.

2968
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:23,160
You know, we think of cells as very rigid,

2969
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,750
like there's a cell, there's a neuron,

2970
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:25,980
or there's a immune cell,

2971
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:29,820
but actually those cells
have a fatty outside,

2972
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:31,980
in particular neurons
have a fatty outside.

2973
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:35,400
It's a thin fatty outside,
it's called the cell membrane,

2974
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,830
and things are floating
around in that cell membrane,

2975
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:40,290
but it's kind of like jello
that hasn't quite fixed.

2976
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:43,380
And so things like receptors
moving into the synapse

2977
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:46,380
or moving out the synapse
for homeostatic plasticity,

2978
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:50,700
things like the ability for certain genes

2979
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:52,560
to be turned on in a
cell or not turned on,

2980
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,960
can depend a lot on
things that are happening

2981
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,700
in that cell membrane and how readily

2982
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:58,350
things move around in the cell membrane.

2983
01:57:58,350 --> 01:57:59,940
One way to think about this whole picture

2984
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,730
of membrane fluidity is that just imagine

2985
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:05,040
that everyone of your
cells has this layer,

2986
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,380
it's kind of a gelatinous-like layer

2987
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:09,090
and there are lots of little rafts

2988
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:12,810
floating around in there, but those rafts

2989
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:15,300
are able to move more quickly

2990
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:17,760
from one place to
another, or get more stuck

2991
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,530
at one place or another,
depending on how set

2992
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:21,210
that jello is.

2993
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:22,800
Inositol

2994
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,900
and lithium,

2995
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:28,980
and as we'll talk about
next, omega-3 fatty acids

2996
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:32,100
seem to change the fluidity
of those membranes,

2997
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:34,230
in other words, they
allow things to move in

2998
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:37,320
and out of those membranes
more readily or not.

2999
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:41,700
And this is no surprise given that

3000
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:44,820
those membranes are
made out of fatty stuff.

3001
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:47,160
In particular, the membranes of neurons

3002
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:49,200
are what called a lipid bilayer,

3003
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:54,200
it's two layers of fat,
bi means two, lipid, fat.

3004
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:57,540
And omega-3 fatty acids
of the sort that are found

3005
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:01,500
in certain fish, and that
fatty fish in particular,

3006
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:05,223
and that are found in fish oil
and cod liver oil, et cetera.

3007
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:09,090
Omega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them

3008
01:59:09,090 --> 01:59:11,190
are used for a lot of different things,

3009
01:59:11,190 --> 01:59:14,580
but they can be readily
incorporated into pathways

3010
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:17,610
or directly incorporated
into cell membranes,

3011
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:19,680
changing the way those cell membranes work

3012
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,870
and if those cell membranes
are the cell membranes

3013
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:24,360
of neurons, changing the
way that neurons work.

3014
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:27,780
So the ability for fish oil,

3015
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:30,270
and in particular, the
omega-3 fatty acids,

3016
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:32,730
which come in varieties like EPA and DHA,

3017
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:34,110
we'll talk about that in a moment,

3018
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:36,840
have been explored at
relatively high dosages

3019
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:40,020
for their ability to
offset some of the effects

3020
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:43,260
of mania and to offset the effects

3021
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:46,110
of depressive episodes
in bipolar disorder.

3022
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:47,460
And actually, the data there

3023
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:50,070
are pretty impressive, although,

3024
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:52,800
although they are varied,

3025
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,320
meaning you will find several studies,

3026
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:57,780
and I'll mention a few,
that found no effect

3027
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:00,090
of omega-3 supplementation
through fish oil,

3028
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:01,530
usually it's capsuled fish oil,

3029
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:03,810
although fish oil can
also be taken, excuse me,

3030
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:04,770
in liquid form.

3031
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:06,090
Oftentimes taking in liquid form

3032
02:00:06,090 --> 02:00:07,800
is the more cost efficient way to do it.

3033
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,920
Taking in capsule form is the
more palatable way to do it,

3034
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,590
because fish oil for a lot
of people doesn't taste good.

3035
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:14,913
But nonetheless,

3036
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:17,550
there are several studies that have shown

3037
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:21,570
that supplementing with fish
oil or omega-3 fatty acids

3038
02:00:21,570 --> 02:00:25,050
at levels of, for instance,
four grams per day

3039
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:25,920
for a period of time,

3040
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,660
this is a study that we
will link in the show notes,

3041
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:29,910
This is Murphy at al. 2012.

3042
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:34,910
This is a fatty acid
supplementation of 70% EPA to DHA

3043
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:37,560
actually worsen symptoms of mania

3044
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,900
over a period of about 16 weeks,

3045
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,030
which on the face of it
makes it seem like, okay,

3046
02:00:42,030 --> 02:00:43,800
omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,

3047
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:47,100
very likely to not be
good for bipolar disorder.

3048
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:50,460
And yet that was the manic phase.

3049
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:52,140
When one looks at some
of the other studies

3050
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:54,690
of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,

3051
02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:58,080
there is, for instance, a
study published in 1999,

3052
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:01,200
this is a much higher
dosage supplementation

3053
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,310
with omega-3 fatty acid,

3054
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:06,810
this is a 9.6 grams of fish
oil per day for four months.

3055
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:10,160
And then actually greatly reduced symptoms

3056
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:14,490
of bipolar depression
compared to the control

3057
02:01:14,490 --> 02:01:16,290
group which received olive oil,

3058
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:19,500
olive oil is a different form
of fat, monounsaturated fat

3059
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:20,820
but doesn't contain as much

3060
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:22,890
of the omega-3 fatty acids and so forth.

3061
02:01:22,890 --> 02:01:27,420
So 9.6 grams of fish oil
per day over four months

3062
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:28,600
is a lot of fish oil

3063
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,590
to be ingesting on a given day.

3064
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:33,930
This was a double blind study.

3065
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:36,750
This was only carried out, I
should mention, in 30 subjects,

3066
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,400
but it was males and females.

3067
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:39,870
And the age range was pretty broad,

3068
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:42,510
anywhere from 18 all the
way up to 64 years of age,

3069
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:44,037
which is important given

3070
02:01:44,037 --> 02:01:46,920
the sort of longitudinal
or changes over time,

3071
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:49,050
that one sees in bipolar disorder.

3072
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:50,850
Here's the major takeaway,

3073
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:52,830
supplementing with high dose omega-3s

3074
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:56,040
does seem to be beneficial
for a good number of people

3075
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:57,600
with bipolar disorder.

3076
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:00,330
However, again, I want
to highlight, however,

3077
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:03,690
it should not be viewed as
the only treatment approach

3078
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:04,560
for bipolar disorder.

3079
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,360
This goes back to what I was saying before

3080
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:09,090
about the essential
need, in most every case,

3081
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:12,360
for high potency
prescription drug treatments

3082
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,130
prescribed by board
certified psychiatrists

3083
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:15,000
for bipolar disorder.

3084
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,870
However, omega-3 supplementation
does seem to improve

3085
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:22,470
or reduce the depressive symptoms

3086
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:24,390
in the major depressive
episodes of bipolar.

3087
02:02:24,390 --> 02:02:25,860
And there are a couple studies,

3088
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,900
and we'll link to these
in the show notes as well,

3089
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,640
that show that it may even improve

3090
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,980
some of the manic episodes as well,

3091
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:34,890
meaning it reduces some
of the manic symptoms.

3092
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:38,100
Now I say all this from
a place of great caution,

3093
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:41,100
because I know, especially
for listeners of this podcast,

3094
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:42,930
there's a lot of interest
in the behavioral tools,

3095
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:43,890
the supplement-based tools,

3096
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:46,290
the nutrition tools that can
support bipolar disorder,

3097
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:48,600
but I don't think I can
overemphasize enough

3098
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,307
that especially for bipolar disorder

3099
02:02:50,307 --> 02:02:53,100
and the great risk of
suicide and suffering

3100
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:55,110
and inappropriate spending,

3101
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:57,480
or I should say maladaptive
spending and impulsivity

3102
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,310
that's associated with bipolar disorder,

3103
02:02:59,310 --> 02:03:01,350
that it's hard to imagine a scenario

3104
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:03,450
in which just talk therapy and fish oil

3105
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:06,180
and lifestyle interventions
are going to completely

3106
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:08,280
suppress or treat bipolar disorder.

3107
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,860
People with bipolar disorder
really need to consider

3108
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:13,830
the full picture of treatments,
the drug treatments,

3109
02:03:13,830 --> 02:03:15,270
the

3110
02:03:15,270 --> 02:03:18,180
talk therapy treatments,
and lifestyle treatments,

3111
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:21,330
and nutraceutical, or we can say

3112
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:24,810
supplement-based treatments
such as omega-3 supplementation

3113
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:28,050
as a full and necessary picture

3114
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:29,880
for dealing with their illness.

3115
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:31,500
I'd be remiss, however,

3116
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:34,020
if I didn't emphasize that
the omega-3 fatty acid

3117
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:35,580
supplementation

3118
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:38,400
is very interesting, not just in terms of

3119
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,230
the subjective effects,

3120
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:41,570
people saying they feel less depressed

3121
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:43,980
or able to sleep better, or
maybe even some reduction

3122
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,150
in manic symptoms,

3123
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:47,070
there's actually been some
really good brain imaging

3124
02:03:47,070 --> 02:03:50,610
to try and understand how
omega-3 fatty acid treatments

3125
02:03:50,610 --> 02:03:52,500
are actually changing the brains

3126
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:54,060
and neural circuits of
people with bipolar.

3127
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:55,320
And I will put a reference to this.

3128
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:56,820
This is a paper that was published

3129
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:58,740
in the American Journal Psychiatry.

3130
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:00,960
It's entitled, Omega-3
Fatty Acid Treatment

3131
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,563
and T2 Whole Brain Relaxation
Times in Bipolar Disorder.

3132
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:08,160
I don't have the opportunity
to go into a lot of detail

3133
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:11,130
right now about what T2 whole
brain relaxation times are,

3134
02:04:11,130 --> 02:04:13,890
but basically when people go into a MRI

3135
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:16,503
or f, functional MRI scanner,

3136
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:19,433
excuse me,

3137
02:04:19,433 --> 02:04:22,320
magnetic resonance imaging scanner,

3138
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,210
what they're getting essentially is pulses

3139
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:27,870
of magnetic fields and the
way that brain structures

3140
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:29,400
and neural activity can be evaluated

3141
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:30,990
has a lot to do with

3142
02:04:30,990 --> 02:04:33,030
the sort of spinning, or not sort of,

3143
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:36,030
it has to do with the spinning
and the relaxation times

3144
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:38,370
of different elements,

3145
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:41,790
literally the protons and
electrons within the neurons,

3146
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:43,710
so it gets really detailed there,

3147
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:46,200
and the relaxation time
is essentially looking

3148
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:49,950
at how quickly some of that
spinning returns to rest.

3149
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:52,380
And in particular,

3150
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:55,770
the fact that the relaxation
times are different

3151
02:04:55,770 --> 02:04:58,440
for aqueous, that is liquid,

3152
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:03,060
versus lipid, fatty versus other
components of brain tissue.

3153
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:05,100
And basically what this study shows

3154
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,680
is that the membranes of neurons

3155
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:09,300
within the brains of these people

3156
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,700
with bipolar disorder,
showed more fluidity,

3157
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:14,940
more ability of things to move
in and around the membranes,

3158
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,840
which we know is an important
component of neuroplasticity

3159
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,970
in bipolar subjects that were treated

3160
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:23,160
with omega-3 fatty acids as compared

3161
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:25,770
to bipolar subjects that did not receive

3162
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:27,150
omega-3 fatty acids.

3163
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:29,490
And fortunately this study also include

3164
02:05:29,490 --> 02:05:32,880
a healthy comparison group where
they could essentially find

3165
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:35,400
that people with bipolar
disorder who supplemented

3166
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,580
with omega-3 had changes
at the cellular level

3167
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:42,450
and the neural circuit level
that brought their brains

3168
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:44,210
and neural circuits closer to that

3169
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:46,290
of the healthy comparison subjects.

3170
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:49,950
So while I don't want to
point to omega-3 fatty acid

3171
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,170
supplementation as the
be-all end-all of treatment

3172
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,240
for bipolar disorder, certainly it is not,

3173
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:58,650
it does have a strong
mechanistic basis for

3174
02:05:58,650 --> 02:06:03,030
its possible support of neural circuitry,

3175
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:05,370
of neuroplasticity, and in particular,

3176
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:07,470
the ability to make
changes in cell membranes

3177
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:10,050
that are very reminiscent of some

3178
02:06:10,050 --> 02:06:11,310
of the neural circuit changes

3179
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:12,930
and changes in membrane fluidity

3180
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:14,700
that are seen with lithium treatment

3181
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,310
and other known
prescription drug treatments

3182
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:20,220
that have been established now for decades

3183
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:22,950
to be very effective for bipolar disorder.

3184
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:26,430
So what that says is that
omega-3 supplementation,

3185
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:30,000
while not the only intervention
that one should consider

3186
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,090
is something to consider and
talk about with your doctor

3187
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:35,640
and it's operating in powerful ways.

3188
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:38,220
It's not just that it's
changing, for instance,

3189
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:40,320
your gut microbiome, which is powerful,

3190
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,520
but is indirect to the brain,

3191
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,800
it does seem to be having
direct effects on neurons

3192
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,910
and neural circuits.

3193
02:06:44,910 --> 02:06:46,530
Before we begin to conclude our discussion

3194
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:48,150
about bipolar disorder,

3195
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:51,000
I want to talk a little bit
about this word, disorder,

3196
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,890
and this is a theme
that doesn't just relate

3197
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:54,270
to bipolar disorder,

3198
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:56,667
but other psychiatric disorders as well.

3199
02:06:56,667 --> 02:06:58,710
And when we think of a disorder,

3200
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:02,100
we think of something that
is really detrimental to us.

3201
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:05,040
Something that really impairs
our ability to function

3202
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:06,750
in work, in school, in relationships,

3203
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:10,080
and really starts to pull
down our health status

3204
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,190
in a variety of ways.

3205
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:14,940
And certainly bipolar
disorder meets those criteria.

3206
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:16,590
However,

3207
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:19,740
there is this idea that
things like bipolar disorder,

3208
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:22,650
even things like
schizophrenia in some cases

3209
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:25,560
are responsible for some
of the creative aspects

3210
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:27,840
or the creative works
that have been observed

3211
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,110
and carried out by human
beings for many centuries.

3212
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:33,180
And believe it or not, there are good data

3213
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:36,360
to support the fact that
certain aspects of mania

3214
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:38,850
are associated with creativity.

3215
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:42,240
Now, we are long overdue for
an episode about creativity,

3216
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,190
its neural circuit
basis, its chemical basis

3217
02:07:44,190 --> 02:07:45,810
here on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3218
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:48,240
and certainly we will
have that conversation.

3219
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:51,510
But in the meantime, I'd like
to just briefly touch upon

3220
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:54,900
this idea that certain
occupations are associated

3221
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:57,840
with a higher incidence
of bipolar depression.

3222
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:58,673
And in fact,

3223
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:02,490
it's been explored at a research level.

3224
02:08:02,490 --> 02:08:04,560
There are data pointed to the fact

3225
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:07,800
that certain individuals
of certain occupations

3226
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:10,470
tend to be more creative
and that creativity

3227
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:12,900
is associated with, again, associated,

3228
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:15,780
this isn't causal, it's
associated, correlated with

3229
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:19,050
higher levels or incidents
of bipolar depression

3230
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:21,090
and maybe even other forms of depression.

3231
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:24,240
So this is a study
looking at mood disorders

3232
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:25,830
in eminent individuals.

3233
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:28,950
So these are people that are
not just good at what they do,

3234
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:30,930
but are exceptional at what they do,

3235
02:08:30,930 --> 02:08:35,640
and explored the percentage
of people in given professions

3236
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:39,000
with either depression or mania.

3237
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,400
And this was actually a data set gleaned

3238
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:45,120
from more than a thousand
20th Century Westerners

3239
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:47,760
based on their biographies that were

3240
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,020
reviewed by other people.

3241
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:50,580
So it's a bit of an indirect measurement.

3242
02:08:50,580 --> 02:08:53,790
This isn't psychiatrist
data, this is data,

3243
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:55,740
or I should say these are data

3244
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:59,340
that were compiled from self reports

3245
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:02,130
or from reads of self reports.

3246
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:03,870
And they explored a number
of different professions.

3247
02:09:03,870 --> 02:09:06,480
So for instance, they looked
at people in the military

3248
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,430
or people who were professional athletes

3249
02:09:08,430 --> 02:09:11,070
or natural scientists
or social scientists,

3250
02:09:11,070 --> 02:09:13,380
people who occupied
positions in public office,

3251
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,720
or were musical performers,

3252
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:18,570
artists, nonfiction
writers, poetry, et cetera.

3253
02:09:18,570 --> 02:09:20,250
There are a lot of professions here.

3254
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:22,710
I will post this or I'll post a link to it

3255
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:24,990
in the show note captions
for you to peruse,

3256
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:27,150
but I'll just give you
a sense of the extremes

3257
02:09:27,150 --> 02:09:29,430
on this graph because
they're very interesting.

3258
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:32,128
Turns out that if you were
to look at the profession

3259
02:09:32,128 --> 02:09:34,980
or I should say among the
professions they looked at

3260
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:38,220
in this study, 'cause they
didn't look at all professions,

3261
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:40,620
those in the military and those

3262
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:43,110
who are professional athletes or had jobs

3263
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:47,730
in the social or natural
sciences, of those,

3264
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:49,680
there was a lower percentage of those

3265
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:51,830
that had depression or mania.

3266
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:53,910
In some cases like those who
were professional athletes

3267
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:56,370
didn't seem to have, there
was no incidence of mania,

3268
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:58,140
at least in this dataset,

3269
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:00,570
whereas at the opposite
extreme of the graph,

3270
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:04,200
those that were poets, so
these are eminent individuals,

3271
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:06,060
people that were exceptional poets,

3272
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:08,040
exceptional fiction writers,

3273
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:11,310
exceptional artists or
non-fiction writers,

3274
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:14,100
well there, especially for the poets,

3275
02:10:14,100 --> 02:10:17,080
you find that as many as 90%

3276
02:10:18,140 --> 02:10:20,490
of these very successful poets

3277
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:23,703
had either depression or mania.

3278
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,210
As high as 90%, that's incredible.

3279
02:10:27,210 --> 02:10:30,240
Contrast that with military
where it's as few as 10%

3280
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:32,277
or professional athletes
where it's as few as 20%,

3281
02:10:32,277 --> 02:10:34,560
and for the professional
athletes, as I mentioned before,

3282
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,240
none of them had mania.

3283
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:39,060
So does this mean that being a poet

3284
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:40,620
will make you manic or depressed?

3285
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:43,320
Well, first of all, let's
look at the poetry category.

3286
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:47,910
It turns out that 75%
of these eminent poets,

3287
02:10:47,910 --> 02:10:51,783
these highly accomplished
poets had major depression,

3288
02:10:52,650 --> 02:10:57,650
whereas only about 20% of
those poets had manic episodes.

3289
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:02,670
So again, it's not that being a poet

3290
02:11:02,670 --> 02:11:03,600
is going to give you mania,

3291
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:04,590
certainly we're not saying that,

3292
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:06,450
it's not that being a poet is
going to give you depression,

3293
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:09,630
but it turns out that
people with depression

3294
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:12,240
and people with depression and mania

3295
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:14,160
seem to gravitate towards poetry

3296
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:17,280
or at least are very successful at poetry.

3297
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,980
Again, associative, correlative,

3298
02:11:19,980 --> 02:11:22,470
no causal relationship here.

3299
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:24,360
But it is really striking to see

3300
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:28,500
how the creative
occupations, poetry, fiction,

3301
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:30,300
art, non-fiction writing,

3302
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:32,130
even though non-fiction
writing is about non-fiction,

3303
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:34,950
it's still creative, music
composition, theater,

3304
02:11:34,950 --> 02:11:37,710
much higher incidents
of things like mania.

3305
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:41,010
In fact, for the people
in theater, the actors,

3306
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:43,170
even though the overall

3307
02:11:43,170 --> 02:11:45,780
occurrence of depression
and mania is lower

3308
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:49,320
than that in poets, the fraction of those

3309
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:52,500
individuals that have
mania is exceedingly high.

3310
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:55,300
It's about 30% of those
that they looked at

3311
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:58,530
who are actors,

3312
02:11:58,530 --> 02:12:02,250
have manic episodes or
have full blown mania.

3313
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:04,860
So I'm referring to these
data because first of all,

3314
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:06,570
I find them incredibly interesting,

3315
02:12:06,570 --> 02:12:07,680
right up until now we've been talking

3316
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:10,260
about bipolar disorder
and other mood disorders

3317
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:11,700
for their maladaptive effects.

3318
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:13,350
And again, they're extremely maladaptive,

3319
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:16,470
much, much higher instance
of suicide, et cetera,

3320
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:19,020
but we'd be wrong to
say that certain aspects

3321
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:20,820
of manic episodes don't
lend themselves well

3322
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:23,100
to creativity or that certain aspects

3323
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:25,680
of major depression don't
lend themselves well

3324
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:28,290
to creativity or to the performing arts

3325
02:12:28,290 --> 02:12:29,310
or to poetry.

3326
02:12:29,310 --> 02:12:32,910
That said, in no way, shape or form,

3327
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:36,270
do I believe that being
depressed is a good thing

3328
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:37,890
or that being manic is a good thing.

3329
02:12:37,890 --> 02:12:40,920
Again, we return to the
basic foundational criteria

3330
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:42,480
for bipolar disorder, major depression

3331
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:46,950
which is that the pressured
speech, the not sleeping,

3332
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:49,860
the incredible increases in energy

3333
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:51,750
and the flights of ideas

3334
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:54,240
are generally not going to lead,

3335
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:56,070
or I think it's fair to say,

3336
02:12:56,070 --> 02:12:58,170
are not going to lead to good places.

3337
02:12:58,170 --> 02:13:00,840
In fact, often lead to bad places.

3338
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:04,140
But we would also be wrong if
we didn't consider the fact

3339
02:13:04,140 --> 02:13:07,740
that there is a somewhat
inextricable relationship

3340
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:10,080
between mania and creativity.

3341
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:13,260
And it could be that hypomania

3342
02:13:13,260 --> 02:13:16,500
or brief periods of mania,
maybe even an hour a day

3343
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:19,530
or 30 minutes a day of
composing or writing poetry,

3344
02:13:19,530 --> 02:13:21,960
maybe even some of the lows that we feel,

3345
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,550
some of the sadness, some of the grief,

3346
02:13:23,550 --> 02:13:25,200
some of the nostalgia that we feel

3347
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:27,240
provided that it's not pathologic,

3348
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:30,240
that it's not persistent
for the four or seven days

3349
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,400
that are diagnostic of bipolar 2

3350
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,470
and bipolar 1 disorder respectively,

3351
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:38,070
well, then we can start
to view emotional states

3352
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:40,350
as something that can
actually lend themselves

3353
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:43,470
to positive outcomes and
maybe even to creativity

3354
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:45,210
and to improved occupations.

3355
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:47,550
So it's important that
we have a nuanced view

3356
02:13:47,550 --> 02:13:50,580
of what sadness versus depression

3357
02:13:50,580 --> 02:13:52,350
versus major depression are,

3358
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:55,230
it's important that we distinguish between

3359
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:58,680
being erratic, being very energized,

3360
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:00,750
and full blown bipolar disorder.

3361
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:02,760
And I raise this for
another reason as well.

3362
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:04,740
Nowadays, it's very common

3363
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:06,480
to hear people saying, ah, you know,

3364
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:07,590
that person is OCD.

3365
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:11,940
Well, on the episode about OCD
that I did a few weeks back,

3366
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:15,120
that you can find if you
like at hubermanlab.com,

3367
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:18,720
in that episode, I pointed out that OCD,

3368
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:21,810
obsessive-compulsive
disorder is very maladaptive.

3369
02:14:21,810 --> 02:14:23,880
I think it's number seven, as I recall

3370
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:26,100
on the list of debilitating diseases,

3371
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:29,160
all diseases in terms
of lost time at work,

3372
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:30,840
suffering relationships, et cetera.

3373
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:32,550
So it's a really serious condition.

3374
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:35,040
And yet we often hear, oh,
that person is obsessive.

3375
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,330
And as I pointed out,

3376
02:14:36,330 --> 02:14:38,790
there is obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

3377
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:41,520
And then there is
obsessive-compulsive tendencies,

3378
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:43,260
which actually benefit people,

3379
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,710
but that is distinct from
obsessive-compulsive disorder

3380
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:49,440
as a clinically diagnosed thing.

3381
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:53,100
Similarly, we hear that, oh,
somebody's being bipolar.

3382
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,180
You know, they're all over the place.

3383
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:55,110
They're bipolar.

3384
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:57,460
Well, that's a very subjective

3385
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:01,830
label that people give
one another in passing,

3386
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:03,210
more and more often I'm hearing this,

3387
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:05,940
and yet bipolar disorder,

3388
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:08,010
whether or not it's BP-1 or BP-2

3389
02:15:08,010 --> 02:15:12,450
are extremely maladaptive
and extremely associated

3390
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:14,370
with high suicide risk.

3391
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:17,460
So while I'm not here to police people,

3392
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,720
I'm not certainly not the word police

3393
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,280
or the nomenclature police,

3394
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:23,160
I do think that whether or
not you refer to people as OCD

3395
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:25,260
or as bipolar, et
cetera, that's up to you,

3396
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:26,460
it's not my place to say,

3397
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:29,010
but I do think it's important
that all of us understand

3398
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:31,590
that these psychiatric
conditions carry with them

3399
02:15:31,590 --> 02:15:33,840
tremendous maladaptive weight.

3400
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:35,940
So today we've really done a deep dive

3401
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:39,420
into bipolar disorder
and to both the manic

3402
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:40,800
and the depressive components

3403
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,890
that are present or can be present

3404
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:45,840
in bipolar disorder
and the different forms

3405
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:47,850
of bipolar disorder and

3406
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:49,800
some of the major treatments
for bipolar disorder,

3407
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:52,200
in particular lithium and
its underlying mechanisms

3408
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,540
and some of the neural
circuit and chemical basis

3409
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:57,600
and neuroplasticity
basis of the treatments

3410
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:01,650
for bipolar disorder, in
particular homeostatic scaling

3411
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:03,780
or homeostatic plasticity.

3412
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:06,600
All of that, of course, is
relevant to bipolar disorder

3413
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:08,730
and I hope will be useful
in your understanding

3414
02:16:08,730 --> 02:16:10,380
and maybe even in your
pursuit of treatments

3415
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:12,980
for bipolar depression,
bipolar disorder for you

3416
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:14,250
or other people.

3417
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:16,980
I also hope that it will be
useful in your understanding

3418
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:18,810
of how brain circuits work

3419
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:20,550
in normal conditions or in conditions

3420
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:23,820
where there is no disease state
or maladaptive conditions.

3421
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:27,450
Homeostatic plasticity
is present in all of us.

3422
02:16:27,450 --> 02:16:31,140
Membrane fluidity due to how
easily things move around

3423
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,930
in the surface, the fatty
layers on the outside of neurons

3424
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:35,910
and the movement of receptors
in and out of neurons

3425
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:37,559
that is present in all of us.

3426
02:16:37,559 --> 02:16:39,689
The influence of omega-3 fatty acids

3427
02:16:39,690 --> 02:16:41,969
is central to that discussion.

3428
02:16:41,969 --> 02:16:44,609
As is the discussion about
various drug treatments

3429
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:46,139
because even if you're
not somebody who's taking

3430
02:16:46,139 --> 02:16:48,899
a drug treatment or who is
pursuing a drug treatment

3431
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:51,719
for bipolar disorder or
another psychiatric condition,

3432
02:16:51,719 --> 02:16:53,729
your serotonin levels,
your dopamine levels,

3433
02:16:53,730 --> 02:16:55,469
your acetylcholine
levels, all of these play

3434
02:16:55,469 --> 02:16:57,779
into what we call your
mental and physical health.

3435
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:59,190
In fact, if any of you are interested

3436
02:16:59,190 --> 02:17:01,559
in the various categories
of neuromodulators

3437
02:17:01,559 --> 02:17:04,019
and tools to adjust those neuromodulators

3438
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:06,870
under more standard
non-disease conditions,

3439
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,670
we did an episode

3440
02:17:08,670 --> 02:17:10,889
on neurochemicals and how to control them.

3441
02:17:10,889 --> 02:17:12,839
You can find that at hubermanlab.com

3442
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,420
along with all other episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3443
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:17,309
I should mention everything is timestamped

3444
02:17:17,309 --> 02:17:18,929
So you can navigate to the specific topics

3445
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:20,700
and tools of interest to you.

3446
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:23,400
And meanwhile, I just
want to thank all of you

3447
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:26,010
for joining me on this voyage

3448
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:29,160
through the biology and the
treatments for bipolar disorder.

3449
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:31,440
I do hope you found it beneficial

3450
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:33,360
both for yourself and for others.

3451
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,330
I just want to remind
people that bipolar disorder

3452
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,530
is an extremely serious condition.

3453
02:17:37,530 --> 02:17:39,660
If you suspect that you
have bipolar disorder

3454
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:41,850
or you know somebody who does,

3455
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:43,830
please make sure that you or they talk

3456
02:17:43,830 --> 02:17:45,540
to a qualified health professional.

02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:22,889
on many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3476
02:18:22,889 --> 02:18:24,239
we talk about supplements.

3477
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,160
Once again, while
supplements aren't necessary

3478
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,719
for everybody, many people derive

3479
02:18:27,719 --> 02:18:29,159
tremendous benefit from them for things

3480
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,740
like enhancing sleep and
focus and hormone support

3481
02:18:31,740 --> 02:18:33,870
and other aspects of
mental and physical health

3482
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:35,129
and performance.

3483
02:18:35,129 --> 02:18:36,869
As I mentioned at the
beginning of today's episode,

3484
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:38,730
the Huberman Lab Podcast
is happy to announce

3485
02:18:38,730 --> 02:18:40,709
that we partnered with
Momentous Supplements.

3486
02:18:40,709 --> 02:18:42,089
If you'd like to see our supplements

3487
02:18:42,090 --> 02:18:44,340
and the ones that we designed
in concert with Momentous,

3488
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:47,790
you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.

3489
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:50,459
Please also check out
Huberman Lab on social media.

3490
02:18:50,459 --> 02:18:53,429
We are hubermanlab on both
Twitter and Instagram.

3491
02:18:53,430 --> 02:18:56,190
In both places, I cover science
and science-related tools,

3492
02:18:56,190 --> 02:18:57,750
some of which overlaps with the content

3493
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:59,219
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3494
02:18:59,219 --> 02:19:00,509
but much of which is distinct

3495
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:03,120
from the information covered
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3496
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,440
We also have a newsletter,

3497
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:06,570
it's called the Neural Network Newsletter.

3498
02:19:06,570 --> 02:19:07,830
It's completely zero cost

3499
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:10,110
and it contains summaries of podcasts

3500
02:19:10,110 --> 02:19:12,240
and some actionable
protocols from each podcast.

3501
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:14,520
You can sign up for it by
going to hubermanlab.com,

3502
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:17,430
go to the menu and click on
Neural Network Newsletter.

3503
02:19:17,430 --> 02:19:18,660
You can also see some examples

3504
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,219
of previous newsletters there.

3505
02:19:20,219 --> 02:19:21,959
I should mention that by signing up,

3506
02:19:21,959 --> 02:19:23,219
you do provide your email,

3507
02:19:23,219 --> 02:19:25,139
but we do not share
your email with anybody.

3508
02:19:25,139 --> 02:19:27,299
And again, it is completely zero cost.

3509
02:19:27,299 --> 02:19:28,979
So once again, thank
you for joining me today

3510
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:30,690
for our discussion about the biology

3511
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:32,190
and treatment of bipolar disorder.

3512
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:34,530
And last, but certainly not least,

3513
02:19:34,530 --> 02:19:36,294
thank you for your interest in science.

3514
02:19:36,294 --> 02:19:39,294
