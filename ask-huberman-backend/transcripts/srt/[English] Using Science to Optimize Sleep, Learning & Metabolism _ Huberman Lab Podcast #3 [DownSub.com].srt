[upbeat music]

2
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:01,930
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

3
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,720
where we discuss science

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,410
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,600
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,860
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,460
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,660
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,870
to bring zero cost to consumer information

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,940
about science and science-related tools

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,700
to the general public.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,570
Along those lines,

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,310
I want to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

15
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,960
Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens, which is an all-in-one

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,100
vitamin mineral probiotic
liquid supplement.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,580
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,270
because I really like getting
my total vitamin mineral

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,060
base covered in one
easy to consume product.

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,010
It also tastes really good.

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,530
I mix mine with a little
bit of lemon juice.

22
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,680
I've been doing that
well over a decade now.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,100
And the inclusion of probiotics
is important to me because

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,040
there's a lot of data out there right now

25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,540
about the importance of gut health

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,890
for the immune system for, mood.

27
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,940
And so by combining all
these things in one product

28
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,600
you get all those things at once.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,140
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,360
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,590
and that will give you a special offer

32
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,230
where you will get a year supply
of liquid vitamin D3 and K2

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,340
vitamin D3 has been shown to be important

34
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,300
for various aspects of immune function

35
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,380
as well as other biological functions.

36
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,750
And so once more, if you
want to try athletic greens

37
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,430
and get the year supply of vitamin D3 K2

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,290
just go to athletigreens.com/huberman.

39
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,610
The other sponsor of today's
podcast is InsideTracker.

40
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,590
InsideTracker is a way to
measure metabolic factors,

41
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,230
hormones, and DNA related factors

42
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,580
by way of blood tests and saliva

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,930
in order to assess one's health.

44
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,990
I'm a big believer in blood
tests and saliva tests

45
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,950
for assessing one's health
markers, because I like data.

46
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,270
And there's really no other way to measure

47
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,480
what's going on in one's body

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,310
without taking the occasional
blood test or saliva test.

49
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,259
You can guess what's going on

50
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,966
but if you really want to know
what's going on under the hood

51
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,700
InsideTracker can be of great help.

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,320
One of the problems with a
lot of products out there

53
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,690
or just regular blood testing

54
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,920
is that you get a lot of
data back about the levels

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,930
of various hormones,
metabolic factors, et cetera,

56
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,960
but you don't know what
to do with those data.

57
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,410
Great thing about InsideTracker
is provided in a format.

58
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,350
They have an online dashboard

59
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,040
that given your particular
levels of various things

60
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,873
directs you

61
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:39,390
toward potential lifestyle related changes

62
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,230
like changes in exercise, or
changes in sleep patterns,

63
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,640
or changes in nutritional patterns,

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,890
that can really help move
those markers and those numbers

65
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,130
on those metabolic factors,
hormones, et cetera

66
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,990
in the direction that you want.

67
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,570
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

68
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,710
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

69
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,547
And if you do that,

70
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:02,740
you'll 25% off their program at checkout.

71
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,660
Okay, let's get started.

72
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,720
Today is episode three of the podcast

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,440
and it is office hours.

74
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,480
Office hours as many of you
know, it's where students

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,430
come to the office of the professor,

76
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,390
sit down and ask questions,

77
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,690
requesting clarification about
things that were confusing,

78
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,880
or to simply go down the
route of exploring a topic

79
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,220
with more depth and detail.

80
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,810
I asked for your questions to be listed

81
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,100
in the comment section of
the previous two episodes

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,170
of the podcast on YouTube,
as well as on Instagram.

83
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,050
And I first of all just want to thank you

84
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,810
for the many questions,
they are excellent.

85
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,200
We read them all.

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,240
We distilled from that
large batch of questions

87
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,500
to two types of questions.

88
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,420
Questions that were asked very often

89
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,390
and were light very often with
a little thumbs up like tab

90
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,700
as well as questions that we
thought could really expand

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,510
on the topics that we've
covered previously.

92
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,570
And today we're going
to cover both of those.

93
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,890
If we did not get to your
question, please don't despair.

94
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,290
We will keep track of those.

95
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,630
And we have several more
episodes devoted to this topic

96
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,460
of sleep and wakefulness and learning

97
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,493
during the month of January, maybe even,

98
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,430
leaking over a little bit
into the month of February.

99
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,029
So, we have time that's
one of the unique formats

100
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,729
of this podcast is that
we have time for dialogue,

101
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,970
we have time for your questions

102
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,620
and we have time to really
go deep into these topics.

103
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,840
It's official Costello is
sleeping in the background.

104
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,190
So if you hear snoring, Costello
is going to be keeping time

105
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,430
with his deep and melodic snoring.

106
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,490
There he goes.

107
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,490
So the questions that we
received, I batched crudely

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,820
into a couple of different categories,

109
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,820
light, exercise, supplementation,
temperature, learning,

110
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,190
plasticity, and mood, and sort
of mood related disorders.

111
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,000
There were a lot of questions about those.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,630
Before we begin any of this

113
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,150
I want to point out something that I,

114
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,500
I always say it sounds like boiler plate

115
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,350
but it's important not just to protect me

116
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,380
but to protect you, which is
that I am not a physician.

117
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,370
I'm not a medical doctor.

118
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,670
I don't prescribe anything,
including behavioral protocols.

119
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,503
I'm a professor.

120
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:13,640
So I profess a lot of things

121
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,853
based on quality peer reviewed studies.

122
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,090
You should take that information.

123
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,120
You should filter it
through whatever it is

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,680
that you currently happen
to be dealing with,

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,990
whether or not that's health
or illness, you should consult

126
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,280
with a licensed healthcare
professional before you add

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,293
or remove anything from
your daily life protocol.

128
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,010
I'm not responsible for your health.

129
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,318
You are, so be smart with this information

130
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:41,393
and be a stringent filter, as we say.

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,363
Okay, very well let's get
started on the actual material.

132
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,290
Somebody asked, what is the
role of moonlight and fire,

133
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm presuming they mean fireplace

134
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,510
or candle or things of that
sort, in circadian rhythms.

135
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,330
Is it okay to view moonlight at night

136
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,720
or will that wake me up?

137
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,270
Will a fire in my fireplace
or using candle light

138
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,900
be too much light.

139
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,790
Great question, also
offers me the opportunity

140
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,940
to share with you

141
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,320
what I think is a quite
beautiful definition

142
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,750
of what light is in a quantitative sense.

143
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,330
So I've mentioned a few
times the use of apps

144
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,920
and light meters and things
to measure things like locks,

145
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,660
which sometimes are also
described in terms of Kendals.

146
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,600
So those are the two units
for measuring light intensity.

147
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
Typically lux, L-U-X is the, is the unit.

148
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,720
And so before we go forward
and discuss this many lux

149
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,010
or that many lux, I want to
just tell you what a lux is

150
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,800
because it relates to this question.

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,800
One lux equals the illumination
of one square meter surface

152
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,730
at one meter away from a single candle.

153
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,563
Think about that.

154
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,800
So somebody actually decided at some point

155
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,290
that the amount of illumination
at one square meter surface,

156
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,840
one meter away from a single
candle, that equals one lux.

157
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,040
So when we talk about 6,000
lux of light intensity

158
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,460
or 10,000 lux of light
intensity, now you have a kind of

159
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,720
a reference or a framework that
would be the equivalent of,

160
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
you could think of it as 6,000 candles

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,790
all with their light intensity shown

162
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,850
on one square meter from
one meters distance away.

163
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,920
Or of course, if it was
a different number of lux

164
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,430
it would be a different number of candles.

165
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,830
So you get the idea.

166
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,700
Here's the great thing.

167
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,310
It turns out that moonlight, candle light,

168
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,980
and even a fireplace, if you
have one of these roaring fires

169
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,710
going in the fireplace,

170
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,110
do not reset your circadian clock at night

171
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,070
and trick your brain into
thinking that it's morning

172
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,020
even though if you've ever
sat close to a fireplace

173
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,090
or even a candle, that
light seems very bright.

174
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,900
And there are two reasons for
that that are very important.

175
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,320
The first one is that
these neurons in your eye

176
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,100
that I discussed in the previous episode

177
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,660
these melanopsin ganglion cells

178
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,960
also called intrinsically
photosensitive ganglion cells.

179
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,990
Those cells adjust their
sensitivity across the day,

180
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,300
and those cells respond best
to the blue-yellow contrast

181
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,860
present in the rising and setting sun,

182
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
so-called low solar angle sun,

183
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,010
also discussed in the previous episode,

184
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,690
but those cells adjust
their sensitivity such that

185
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,810
they will not activate
the triggers in the brain

186
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,810
that conveyed daytime signals
when they view moonlight,

187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,530
even a full moon a really
bright moon or fire.

188
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,250
Now this does raise an
interesting kind of thought point,

189
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,210
which is, you know, a lot of people talked

190
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,549
about lunacy and the fact that
when there's a full moon out

191
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,049
people act differently
and behave differently.

192
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,370
There's a lot of lore around that.

193
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,460
There's actually a little bit
of quality science around that

194
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,320
that maybe we can address in the future.

195
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,850
But, moonlight is typically
not going to wake us up

196
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,630
too much, except maybe
the moon is really full

197
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,020
and really bright, there's
possibility for that.

198
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,690
So, providing you're not going
to burn down the structure

199
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,370
you're in, you're not going
to burn down the forest,

200
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,130
enjoy your, your fireplaces,
enjoy your lights from candles.

201
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,590
And those are perfectly safe

202
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,310
without disrupting your circadian rhythm.

203
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,760
Because we talked about
just how crucial it is

204
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,800
to avoid bright lights

205
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,740
between the hours of about
10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.

206
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,338
Except when you need to view
things for sake of safety

207
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:24,530
or work or so and so forth.

208
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,610
I also received a lot of
questions about red light.

209
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,270
Now, I think I was asked those questions

210
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,800
because red light is used

211
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,950
in a number of different
commercial products

212
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,770
where these products
tend to include a sheet,

213
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,650
of very bright red lights.

214
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,470
That one is supposed to
view early in the day.

215
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,360
And there are various claims attached

216
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,130
to these red light devices

217
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,970
that they improve mitochondrial function,

218
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,090
that they improve metabolism there-

219
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm going to be really honest
and I can't name brands,

220
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,440
and I'm not going to
name particular studies.

221
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,460
'Cause what I'm about to say

222
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,993
about these studies is
not particularly unkind

223
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,600
but let's just say that none
of the studies that I've seen

224
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,740
except for one that I'll
talk about in a moment,

225
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,350
pointing to the positive
effects of red light

226
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,850
on the visual system are
published in blue ribbon journals.

227
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,260
They tend to be published in journals

228
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,163
that I had to work hard to find.

229
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:21,170
I'm not sure what the peer
review and stringency level is.

230
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,060
Now, that's not to say
red light isn't beneficial

231
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,340
because there is one study in particular

232
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,850
that came from Glen Jeffrey's Lab

233
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,200
at the University of College, London

234
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,240
it was published last year.

235
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,970
Glen is somebody I happen to know

236
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,720
is an excellent reputation,
excellent vision scientist,

237
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,420
what this study essentially showed.

238
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,000
And again, this is a study that

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I very much liked the data

240
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,190
and think it was done
with very high standards.

241
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,690
What this study shows is
that, viewing red light

242
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,090
for a few minutes each morning

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,190
can have positive effects on mitochondria

244
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,430
in a particular retinal cell
type, that tends to degenerate

245
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,200
or decline in function with age in humans.

246
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,950
And that cell type is the photoreceptor.

247
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,380
The photoreceptor is a
type of cell in your eye

248
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,120
that sits at the back of the eye.

249
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,600
It's kind of some distance
away from the ganglion cells.

250
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,020
And it's the cell that
converts light information

251
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,650
into electrical signals that the rest

252
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,380
of the retina and brain can understand.

253
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,010
These are vitally important
cells without them,

254
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,170
people are blind.

255
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,780
And many people's vision
gets worse with age.

256
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,780
In particular, age related
macular degeneration

257
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,270
but also related to some other factors

258
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,510
including photo receptor functionality

259
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,740
just getting worse with time.

260
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,800
And what Glen showed was
that red light flashes

261
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,870
delivered in particular early in the day

262
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,630
but not late in the day can
help repair the mitochondria.

263
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,910
Now this study needs more support

264
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,830
from additional studies of course.

265
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,070
They are doing a clinical trial.

266
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,520
They did report on what I
think it was 12 patients.

267
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,160
And so the work is ongoing,
but that was very interesting.

268
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,030
And it points to some
potentially really useful things

269
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,530
about red light.

270
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,740
However, most of the questions I got

271
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,140
about red light for sake of office hours

272
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,550
were about the use of red
light later in the day.

273
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,930
So here's the deal, in principle red light

274
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,730
will not stimulate the
melanopsin retinal neurons

275
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,240
that wake up the brain and circadian clock

276
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
and signal daytime.

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,780
However, most of the red lights
in particular the red lights

278
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,390
that come on these
sheets of these products

279
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,930
that people are supposed
to view them in order to

280
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,730
access a number of
proclaimed health effects,

281
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,410
those are way too bright

282
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,410
and would definitely wake
up your body and brain.

283
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,280
So if you're going to use those products

284
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,300
and I'm not suggesting
you do, or you don't,

285
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,460
but if that's your thing,
you would want to use those

286
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,293
early in the day.

287
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,050
Who knows you might
even derive some benefit

288
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,180
on mitochondria function
in these photo receptors.

289
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,270
But if you're thinking about red light

290
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,100
for sake of avoiding the
negative effects of light

291
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,250
later in the day and at night,
then you want that red light

292
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,410
to be very, very dim,
certainly much dimmer

293
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,303
than is on most of those
commercial products.

294
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,040
Now, do you need red lights? No.

295
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,620
Although red lights are rather convenient

296
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,850
because you can see
pretty well with them on,

297
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,770
but if they're dim, they won't
wake up the circadian clock.

298
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,350
They won't have this
dopamine disrupting thing

299
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,180
that we talked about in
the previous podcast.

300
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,550
So there's a role for red light

301
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,930
potentially early in the day

302
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,720
and for mitochondrial repair
in the photoreceptors,

303
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,940
there's a role for dim red light

304
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,570
later in the day and at night.

305
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,810
So you're starting to notice
a theme here which is that,

306
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,120
there's no immediate prescription
of look at these light,

307
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,290
it's look at these lights potentially

308
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,597
if that's what you want to
do at particular times of day

309
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,430
and we're particular intensities.

310
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,040
It brings us back to the blue light issue

311
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,380
which is so many people are obsessed

312
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,010
with avoiding blue light, but you actually

313
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,570
want a ton of blue light early in the day

314
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,403
and throughout the day.

315
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,210
So don't wear your blue blockers then

316
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,550
or maybe even don't wear them at all.

317
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,160
And at night, it doesn't matter
if you have blue blockers on

318
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,180
if the lights are bright
enough, then you're still

319
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,800
going to be activating
these cells and mechanisms.

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,650
I just want to add something

321
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,560
about the science behind
the blue blocker confusion.

322
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,330
So these melanopsin retinal
cells do react to blue light.

323
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,910
That that is the best stimulus

324
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,250
for one of these
melanopsin cells, which led

325
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,300
to the belief that blue
blockers would be a good thing

326
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,930
for preventing resetting of
the circadian clock at night

327
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,040
and deleterious effects
of screens, et cetera.

328
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,230
However, the people
that made these products

329
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,360
fail to actually read the
papers from start to finish

330
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,130
or if they did, they didn't
comprehend a critical element

331
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,930
which is that most of
those papers early on

332
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,440
took those neurons out
and put them in a dish.

333
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,580
And when they did that,
they divorced those neurons

334
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,660
from their natural connections in the eye.

335
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,400
It turns out in your IMI right now,

336
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,960
because that's what we care
about, these cells exist

337
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,310
and the cells respond to blue light

338
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,330
but also to other wavelengths of light

339
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,870
because they not only
respond directly to light

340
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,750
as they do in a dish, they also respond

341
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,410
to input from photo receptors.

342
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,500
So if you talk to anyone in
the circadian biology field,

343
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,107
they'll tell you, "Oh,
yeah this blue light thing,

344
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,590
has really gotten out of control."

345
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,950
Because people assume that
blue light is the culprit

346
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,670
because blue light is the best stimulus.

347
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,120
That doesn't mean that blue
light is the only stimulus

348
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,930
that will trigger these cells, okay?

349
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,250
So like many things a
scientific paper can be accurate

350
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,500
without being exhaustive.

351
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,690
And a lot of claims about
products can be accurate,

352
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,523
but not exhaustive.

353
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:20,570
So blue light during the day is great.

354
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,370
Get that screen light, get that sunlight

355
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,137
especially getting overhead lights.

356
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:27,050
I'll talk about all this
in the previous podcast,

357
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,050
but at night you really want
to avoid those bright lights.

358
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,140
And it doesn't matter if it's
blue light or something else.

359
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,610
And so there was a real confusion about

360
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,160
the papers and the data when most

361
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,483
of those product
recommendations were made.

362
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,830
Okay.

363
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,800
While we're on that topic,
let's talk about light

364
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,040
in other orifices of the body.

365
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,070
I made a kind of a joke about
this, the last podcast episode

366
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,840
but a couple of people
wrote to me and said,

367
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,800
well, I've seen some
claims that light delivered

368
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,050
to the ears into the ears
or the roof of the mouth

369
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,770
or up the nose can be beneficial

370
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:05,463
for some setting circadian rhythms, no.

371
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,740
Not directly anyway.

372
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,120
And this is a great opportunity
for us to distinguish

373
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,200
between what is commonly
called the placebo effect

374
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,020
but a more important way to
think about any manipulation

375
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,000
behavioral or otherwise
that you might do is

376
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,210
the difference between
modulation and mediation.

377
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,970
There are a lot of things that
will modulate your biology.

378
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,830
Putting a couple of lights up your nose,

379
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,390
please don't do this.

380
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,080
Might modulate your biology by way

381
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,920
of the stress hormone that's released

382
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,860
when you stuffed those
things up your nose.

383
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,760
Remember earlier a previous
podcast, I said that

384
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,220
virtually anything we'll face
shifts your circadian rhythm

385
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,300
if it's different and dramatic enough.

386
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,000
So the question is, is
it the light delivered

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,920
up the nose or through the ears

388
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,880
or some other orifice that's
mediating the process?

389
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,900
Is it actually tapping
into the natural biology

390
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,710
of the system that you're
trying to manipulate?

391
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,960
And this is where I like to distinguish

392
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,240
between real biology and hacks.

393
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,950
I don't like the word hack

394
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,450
or frankly neuro hacking or bio hacking.

395
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,460
I just don't like the
term because a hack is

396
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,810
is using something for a purpose

397
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,079
for which it was not intended, right?

398
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,439
But where you can kind
of, it's kind of a cheat

399
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,680
and that's not how biology works well.

400
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,930
So I try and distinguish

401
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,619
between things that really
mediate biological processes

402
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,549
and things that Modulate them.

403
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,530
There are a number of
commercial products out there

404
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,050
with some studies attached to them,

405
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,020
claiming that light delivered
to the ears or wherever can

406
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,800
adjust your wakefulness
or adjust your sleep.

407
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,840
I've looked at those papers again,

408
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,470
I'm probably going to lose
some friends by saying this

409
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,410
but maybe I'll gain a few as well.

410
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,410
Not blue ribbon journals, frankly,

411
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,550
oftentimes read the small print.

412
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,360
There was a conflict of
interest clause there

413
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,180
related to commercial interests.

414
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,050
If somebody disagrees
with me outright on this

415
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,390
and can send to me a peer reviewed paper,

416
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,750
published in a quality journal

417
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,250
about light delivered anywhere,
but the eyes of humans

418
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,730
that can mediate circadian,
rhythms, wakefulness et cetera,

419
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,450
I'm more than happy to take a look at that

420
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,610
and change my words and stance on this

421
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,470
and do it publicly, of course.

422
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,670
But until then I'm guessing that

423
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,820
the proper controls were not done

424
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,300
of adjusting for heat
that could be delivered

425
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,860
which can definitely
shift circadian rhythms.

426
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,000
We're going to talk about temperature

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,200
and other things like that.

428
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,620
So light to the eyes folks is
where these light effects work

429
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,050
in humans, in other animals,

430
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,773
they have extra ocular photo
reception in humans, no.

431
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,930
And just be mindful, I mean,

432
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,910
I'm not trying to encourage people

433
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,260
to avoid certain products in particular

434
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,900
but just be mindful of this difference

435
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,570
between modulation and mediation.

436
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,470
A mediating, a process
through a hard wired

437
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,860
or long-standing biological
mechanism is really

438
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,240
where you're going to see the
powerful effects over time.

439
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,550
I also, as you've probably noticed,

440
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,010
I really tend to favor behavioral tools

441
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,760
and zero cost tools first,

442
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,010
and getting those dialed
in before you start,

443
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,240
plugging in and swallowing
and putting things

444
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,140
in various places just
to really figure out

445
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,210
how your biology works and explore that,

446
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,730
unless there's of course a clinical need

447
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,120
to take a prescribed drug in which case,

448
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,230
by all means, listen to your doctor.

449
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,490
Okay, a huge number of
people asked me about

450
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,720
what about light through windows?

451
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,693
And I actually did an
Instagram post about this look,

452
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,640
setting your circadian clock with sunlight

453
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,277
coming through a window
is going to take 50

454
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:32,750
to 100 times longer.

455
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,000
If you want the date on that,
I'd be happy to send you

456
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,720
to the various papers that were described

457
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,140
in the previous podcast that
Jamie Zeitzer from Stanford.

458
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,280
And I have discussed also elsewhere

459
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,630
but here's really the key thing with us.

460
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,650
Do the experiment.

461
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,220
You can download the free app Light Meter.

462
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,950
You can have a bright day outside

463
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,470
or some sunlight hold up
that app, take a picture.

464
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,050
It'll tell you how many lux
now, you know what lux are.

465
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,160
It will tell you how many
lux are in that environment.

466
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,620
Now close the window.

467
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,640
And if you want close the
screen or don't open the screen

468
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,720
you can do all sorts of experiments.

469
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,410
You'll see that it will at
least half the amount of lux.

470
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,820
And it doesn't scale linearly.

471
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,340
Meaning let's say I get
a 10,000 lux outside,

472
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,450
5,000 looking out through an open window

473
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,290
and then I closed the
window and it's 2,500 lux.

474
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,870
It does not mean that you just
need to view that sunlight

475
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,253
for twice as long if it's
half as many lux, okay?

476
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:29,010
It's not like 2,500 lux
means you need to look

477
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,843
for 10 minutes

478
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:33,090
and 5,000 lux means you
look for five minutes.

479
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,690
It doesn't scale that way

480
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,030
just because the biology
doesn't work that way.

481
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,490
Best thing to do is to
get outside, if you can,

482
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,990
if you can't next best thing to do

483
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,600
is to keep that window open.

484
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,170
It is perfectly fine to
wear prescription lenses

485
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,600
and contacts.

486
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,060
Why is it okay to wear
prescription lenses and contacts,

487
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,880
when those are glass also,

488
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,900
but looking through a window,
diminishes the effect.

489
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,590
Well, we should think about this.

490
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,830
The lenses that you wear
in front of your eyes

491
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,280
by prescription or on your eyes

492
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,470
are designed to focus the
light on to your neural retina.

493
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,770
In fact, that's what near-sightedness
is, is when the image

494
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,160
because your lens
doesn't work quite right.

495
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,350
The image falls in front
of the neural retina,

496
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,080
wearing a particular lens in front of that

497
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,400
focuses the lens onto your
retina onto these very neurons.

498
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,590
So they can communicate that to the brain.

499
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,870
It's Costello is loving this light.

500
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,010
He's deep in sleep.

501
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,100
And if we, maybe we
could play him some tones

502
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,020
and he'll remember it
later, based on the studies,

503
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,953
we're going to talk about in a little bit.

504
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,150
I don't know how we'd know
if he remembered it or not,

505
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,380
but prescription lenses are fine.

506
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,940
In fact, they're great for this reason

507
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,980
they're actually focusing
the light onto the retina.

508
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
So think about this logically

509
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,840
and all of a sudden it makes
perfect sense your glass window

510
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,280
or your windshield or the
side window of your car,

511
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,030
it isn't optically
perfect to bring the image

512
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,570
and the light onto your retina.

513
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,220
In fact, what it's
doing is it's scattering

514
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,680
and filtering light in particular

515
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,470
the wavelengths of light that you want.

516
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,910
So, if you live in a low light environment

517
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,090
lots of questions about this.

518
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,800
We talked about this, the previous podcast

519
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,420
but just get outside for longer or,

520
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,890
and/or use really bright lights inside.

521
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,420
Okay, so let's think about

522
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,140
why I'm making some of
these recommendations

523
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,540
because I think it can really empower you

524
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,840
with the ability to change your behavior

525
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,530
in terms of light
viewing and other things,

526
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,260
depending on time of year,

527
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,050
depending on other lifestyle factors.

528
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,960
The important point to understand
is that early in the day,

529
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,830
your central circadian clocks

530
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,240
and all these mechanisms are
looking for a lot of light.

531
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,570
I mean, they don't have
a mind of their own,

532
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,030
but it needs a lot of light to
trigger this daytime signal,

533
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,263
alertness et cetera.

534
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,270
And early in the day, but
not in the middle of the day,

535
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,950
you can sum or add photons.

536
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,240
So there's this brief period
of time early in the day,

537
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,270
when the sun is low in the sky

538
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,500
when your brain and body are expecting

539
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,330
a morning wake up signal

540
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,570
where let's say, it's
not that bright outside.

541
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,820
Someone sent me a picture or
a little movie of their walk

542
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,010
in England, and it was pretty overcast

543
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,410
and they were using
light meter and they said

544
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,090
it's only about 700
lux or maybe even less.

545
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,610
And I said, well, stay outside longer.

546
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,200
But when you get inside, turn
on the lights really bright

547
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,960
and overhead lights in particular,

548
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,780
because those will be best for
stimulating these mechanisms.

549
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,110
And that's because at least

550
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,560
for the first few hours of the day,

551
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,840
you can continue to some
or add photon activation

552
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,370
of the cells in the eye and the brain.

553
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,700
In the middle of the day, once
the sun is overhead, or even

554
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,340
if you stay inside all morning,

555
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,040
and then you're in the
circadian dead zone,

556
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,470
which sounds terrible and it is terrible.

557
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,280
You doesn't matter if you
get a ton of artificial light

558
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,160
or even sunlight,

559
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,570
you're not going to shift
your circadian clock.

560
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,990
You're not going to get
that wake up signal.

561
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,790
And then in the evening,
you want to think about

562
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,480
this whole system as being vulnerable

563
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,450
to even a few photons of light
because of their sensitivity

564
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,210
to light really goes up at night.

565
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,530
And I talked last time
about how you can protect

566
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,220
against that sensitivity by
looking at the setting sun

567
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,250
and watching the evening sun,

568
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,870
even if it's not crossing the horizon

569
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,350
around the time of sunset.

570
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,960
And that's because it adjusts
your retinal sensitivity

571
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
and your melatonin pathway

572
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,780
so that light is not as
detrimental to melatonin at night.

573
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,800
Think about the afternoon
sunlight viewing as kind of a,

574
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,400
I think of it as kind of
a Netflix inoculation.

575
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,760
It allows me to watch a little bit

576
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,210
of Netflix in the evening,
although it's very

577
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,310
hard to watch a little bit
of anything on Netflix.

578
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,960
It seems like there's some
other neuro-biological process

579
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,040
that going on there where I have to watch

580
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,420
episode after episode after episode.

581
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,730
But in any case, you can protect yourself

582
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,440
against some of that bad
effect of light at night

583
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,730
by looking at light in the evening.

584
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,160
It really does adjust down
the sensitivity of the system.

585
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,080
Okay.

586
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,540
I want to talk about seasonal changes

587
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,870
in all these things as they
relate to mood and metabolism.

588
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,750
So depending on where
you are in the world,

589
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,340
Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere

590
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,350
at the equator or closer to the poles,

591
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,720
the days and nights are going
to be different lengths.

592
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,140
That just makes sense.

593
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,680
But that translates to
real biological signals

594
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,370
that impact everything from
wakefulness and sleep times

595
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,060
but also mood and metabolism.

596
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,740
So here's how this works.

597
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,970
Now, after seeing the previous
episode of the podcast

598
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,620
and paying attention here, you are armed

599
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,710
with the knowledge to
really understand how it is

600
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,350
that believe it or not, every
cell in your body is tuned

601
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,840
to the movement of the
planet relative to the sun.

602
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,360
So as all of you know,

603
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,110
the earth spins once every
24 hours on its axis.

604
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,070
So part of that day
were bathed in sunlight

605
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,860
depending on where we are
the other half of the day

606
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,850
or part of the day we're in darkness.

607
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,360
The earth also travels
around the sun 365 days

608
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,410
is the time that it takes, one year,

609
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,893
to travel around that sun.

610
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,080
The earth is tilted.

611
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,160
It's not perfectly upright.

612
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,220
So the earth is tilted on its axis.

613
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,790
So depending on where we
are in that 365 day journey

614
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,650
and depending on where we
are in terms of hemisphere,

615
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,770
Northern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,

616
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,240
some days of the year
are longer than others.

617
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,150
Some are very short, some are very long.

618
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,050
If you're at the, at the equator

619
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,590
you experience less variation

620
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,150
in day length and therefore nightlife.

621
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,930
And if you're closer to the poles,

622
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,760
you're going to experience
some very long days.

623
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,410
And you're also going to
experience some very short days

624
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,900
depending on which poll you're at

625
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,570
and what time of year it is.

626
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,900
The simple way to put this
as depending on time of year

627
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,220
the days are either getting
shorter or getting longer.

628
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,380
Now, every cell in your
body adjusts its biology

629
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,380
according to day length, except
your brain, body and cells

630
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,810
don't actually know
anything about day length.

631
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,980
It only knows night length.

632
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,240
And here's how it works.

633
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,963
Light inhibits melatonin powerfully.

634
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,750
If days are long and getting longer,

635
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,200
that means melatonin is reduced.

636
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,500
The total amount of melatonin is less

637
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,130
because light is more,
therefore melatonin is less.

638
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,440
If days are getting shorter,

639
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,510
light can't inhibit melatonin as much,

640
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,310
through the summing of photon mechanisms

641
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,980
that we talked about before,

642
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,840
and that melatonin
signal is getting longer.

643
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,300
So every cell in your body actually knows

644
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,760
external day length and
therefore time of year

645
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,870
by way of the duration
of the melatonin signal.

646
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,710
And in general, it's fair to
say that in diurnal animals,

647
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,870
meaning animals like us
that tend to be awake

648
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,430
during the daytime and
not nocturnal animals,

649
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,053
which tend to be awake at night.

650
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,700
The longer the melatonin
signal, the more depressed

651
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,760
not necessarily clinically depressed,

652
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,770
although that can happen

653
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,173
but the more depressed
our systems tend to be.

654
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,300
Reproduction, metabolism, mood,
turnover rates of skin cells

655
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,890
and hair cells all tend to be diminished

656
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,210
compared to the spring and summer months

657
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,600
for some Northern hemisphere,
spring and summer months,

658
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,910
or the times in which days are very long.

659
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,700
And there's less melatonin that tends to,

660
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,900
in almost all animals,
including humans, more breeding,

661
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,610
more hormone elevation of the hormones

662
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,372
that stimulate breeding reproduction

663
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:33,372
and fertility metabolism
is up, lipid metabolism

664
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,140
fat-burning is up,
protein synthesis is up.

665
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,830
These things tend to
correlate with the seasons.

666
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,050
Now, some people are very, very

667
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,330
strongly tied to the seasons.

668
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,280
They get depressed,
clinically depressed in winter

669
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,570
and light therapies are very
useful for those people.

670
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,960
Some people love the winter
and they're happiest in winter

671
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,470
and they feel kind of depressed in summer.

672
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,650
Although that is far more rare.

673
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,880
That doesn't mean depression
cannot exist in the summer,

674
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,680
but when we're talking
about seasonal depression

675
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
that tends to be true.

676
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,203
It's more depression in winter.

677
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,900
Now there's other things that
correlate with seasonality.

678
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,640
Suicide rates tend to
be highest in the spring

679
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,980
not in the winter,

680
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,800
but that has to do with some of the more

681
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,150
complicated and unfortunately
tragic aspects of suicide

682
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,910
which is that oftentimes
people will commit suicide

683
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,420
not at the very depths
of their energy levels,

684
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,720
but as they're emerging from
those depths of low energy.

685
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,660
So we'll talk about
suicidality and mood disorders

686
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,040
in a later podcast season,
meaning a month later.

687
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,800
But for now, just understand that

688
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,850
everybody is going through
these natural fluctuations

689
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,840
depending on the duration
of the melatonin signal.

690
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,110
Now this might lead you to say, "Well,

691
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,160
then I should just really
get as much light as I can

692
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,830
all the time and reduce melatonin
feel great all the time."

693
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,050
Unfortunately, doesn't work that way

694
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,370
because melatonin also
has important effects

695
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,883
on the immune system.

696
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,640
It has important effects

697
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,900
on transmitter systems
in the brain, et cetera.

698
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,860
So everybody needs to
figure out for themselves

699
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,970
how much light they need early in the day

700
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,250
and how much light they need to avoid

701
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,160
late in the day,

702
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,650
in order to optimize
their mood and metabolism.

703
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,560
There is no one size fits all prescription

704
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,180
because there's a range
of melatonin receptors,

705
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,480
there are a range of
everything from metabolic types

706
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,410
to genetic histories,
family histories, et cetera.

707
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,730
There is no one size fits all prescription

708
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,040
but by understanding that
light and extended day length

709
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,650
inhibit melatonin and melatonin tends

710
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,360
to be associated with a more depressed

711
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,400
or reduced functioning of
these kinds of activity driving

712
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,500
and mood elevating signals,

713
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,010
and understanding that
you have some control

714
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,930
over melatonin by way of
light, including sunlight

715
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,460
but also artificial light,
and that should empower you

716
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,290
I believe, to make the adjustments

717
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,960
that if you're feeling low you might ask,

718
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
how much light am I getting?

719
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,580
What am I getting that light?

720
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,930
Because sleep is also important
for restoring mood, right?

721
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,770
So you need sleep.

722
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,910
You can't just, just crush
melatonin across the board

723
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,270
and expect to feel good because

724
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,010
then you're not going to
fall asleep and stay asleep.

725
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,920
Melatonin, not incidentally comes from,

726
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,680
is synthesized from serotonin.

727
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,770
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
that is associated

728
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,470
with feelings of well-being
provided to proper levels,

729
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,440
but well-being of a particular kind.

730
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,390
Well-being associated
with quiescence and calm

731
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,840
and the feeling that we
have enough resources

732
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,110
in our immediate kind of conditions.

733
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,150
Is the kind of thing that
comes from a good meal

734
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,220
or sitting down with friends
or holding a loved one,

735
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,740
or conversing with somebody
that you really bond with.

736
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,730
Serotonin does not stimulate action.

737
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,630
It tends to stimulate stillness.

738
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,300
Very different than the
neuromodulator dopamine

739
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,170
which is a reward feel good neuromodulator

740
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,730
that stimulates action.

741
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,040
And actually dopamine is the cursor

742
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,570
to epinephrin, to adrenaline

743
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,130
which actually puts us into action.

744
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,460
There it's actually made
from dopamine, right?

745
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,260
So, you can start to think how about light

746
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,470
as a signal that is very powerful

747
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,660
for modulating things
like sleep and wakefulness

748
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,530
but also serotonin
levels, melatonin levels.

749
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,270
And I talked about this previously

750
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,200
but I'll mention once more,

751
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,210
that light in the middle of the night

752
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,570
reduces dopamine levels to the point where

753
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,510
it can start causing problems

754
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,680
with learning and memory and mood.

755
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,760
That's one powerful reason
to void bright light

756
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,308
in the middle of the night.

757
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:38,950
Okay.

758
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,410
Seasonal rhythms have a number of effects

759
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,460
but humans are not
purely seasonal breeders.

760
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,950
Unlike a lot of animals,
we breed all year long.

761
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,390
In fact, there's a preponderance
of September babies

762
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,050
in my life, not actual babies,

763
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,220
because they're born in September

764
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,170
which means that they were
conceived in December,

765
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,143
without knowing the details
we can fairly assume that.

766
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,470
And December, at least in
the Northern hemisphere

767
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,490
at days tend to be shorter
and nights tend to be longer.

768
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,890
So clearly humans aren't seasonal breeders

769
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,200
but there are shifts in
breeding and fertility

770
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,240
that exist in humans,

771
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,700
but also much more
strongly in other animals.

772
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,290
So seasonal effects vary.

773
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,360
Some of you will experience
very strong seasonal effects

774
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,020
others of you will not.

775
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,110
I think everybody should be taking care to

776
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,050
get adequate sunlight and to
avoid bright light at night

777
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,063
throughout the year if possible.

778
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,960
Throughout this podcast
and in previous episodes,

779
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,830
I've been mentioning neuromodulators,

780
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,330
things like serotonin and dopamine

781
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,370
which tend to buy a certain brain circuits

782
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,030
and things in our body to
happen in certain brain circuits

783
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,340
and things in our body not to happen.

784
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,000
One of the ones I've mentioned
numerous times is epinephrin

785
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,030
which is a neuromodulator that
tends to put us into action,

786
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,540
make us want to move.

787
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,617
In fact, when it's released
in high amounts in our brain

788
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,240
and body, it can lead
to what we call stress

789
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,933
or the feeling of being stressed.

790
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,590
Several people ask me,
what's the difference

791
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,360
between epinephrin and adrenaline.

792
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,960
Adrenaline is secreted
from the adrenal glands

793
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,920
which sit right above our kidneys.

794
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,139
Epinephrin is the exact same molecule

795
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,519
except that it's released
within the brain.

796
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,219
And so people use these
phrases or these words

797
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,909
rather interchangeably, epi means near

798
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:26,259
or on top of sometimes and neph, neph

799
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,219
Anytime you see nephron
or ph it means kidney.

800
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,299
So it means near the kidney.

801
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,310
So epinephrin actually
means near the kidney.

802
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,639
So it was used originally
to describe adrenaline,

803
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,429
but epinephrin and adrenaline
are basically the same thing

804
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,539
and they tend to stimulate
agitation and the desire to move.

805
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,540
That's what that's about.

806
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,590
Which brings us to the topic of exercise.

807
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,969
Got a lot of questions about exercise.

808
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,609
What forms of exercise are
best for sleeping well?

809
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,573
When should I exercise et cetera.

810
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,790
There's a lot of them individual
variability around this,

811
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,360
but I can talk about what I
know from the science literature

812
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,223
and what I happened to do myself.

813
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,280
There are basically two forms of exercise

814
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,670
that we can talk about although, of course

815
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,210
I realize there are many
different forms of exercise.

816
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,410
There's much more nuance to this,

817
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,630
but we can talk about
cardiovascular exercise,

818
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,670
where the idea is to repeat a movement

819
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,180
over and over and over continuously.

820
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,860
So that'd be like running, biking, rowing

821
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,040
and cycling this kind of thing.

822
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,930
Or there's a resistance
exercise where you're moving,

823
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,800
lifting, presumably putting down also

824
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,010
things of progressively
heavier and heavier weight

825
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,223
that you couldn't do
continuously for 30 minutes.

826
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,890
So cardiovascular exercise is typically

827
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,840
the more aerobic type exercise
and resistance exercise

828
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,690
of course is the more
anaerobic type exercise.

829
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,070
And yes, there's
variation between the two.

830
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:54,290
Most studies of exercise have
looked at aerobic exercise

831
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,990
because that's basically the
thing that you can get a rat

832
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,280
or a mouse to do.

833
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,880
You know what's really
weird about rats and mice,

834
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,730
they like to run on wheels so much,

835
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,100
that someone actually did this study,

836
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,570
it was published in
science they put a wheel,

837
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,500
a running wheel in the middle of a field

838
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,960
and mice ran to that wheel
and ran on the wheel.

839
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,010
They turns out that what
they like is the passage

840
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,170
of the visual image of the
bars in front of their face,

841
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,030
which I find kind of remarkable

842
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,440
and troubling because it
seems so like trivial,

843
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,547
but anyway they love aerobic exercise.

844
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:29,660
And so most of the studies
were done on these mice

845
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,700
that love running on wheels.

846
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,700
Whereas so far as it's
been challenging to find

847
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,120
conditions in which mice
really liked to lift weights

848
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,880
or we'll do it in a laboratory.

849
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,210
So any weight bearing exercise studies

850
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,030
really have to be done in humans.

851
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,690
And since humans are
what we're interested in,

852
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,300
there are some studies
looking at these two things

853
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,040
and when they tend to work best.

854
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,110
Now you will see some
places aerobic exercise

855
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,410
is best done in the morning

856
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,870
and weight training is
best done in the afternoon.

857
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,933
I think there's far more
individual variation than that.

858
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,840
I think there are however,
a couple of windows

859
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,780
that the exercise science literature

860
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,400
and the circadian literature points to as

861
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,560
windows related to body temperature

862
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,433
in which performance, injury,

863
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,200
in which performance is optimized

864
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,300
injury is reduced and so on.

865
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,820
And those tend to be 30
minutes after waking.

866
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,830
And that probably correlates
with the inflection in cortisol

867
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,330
associated with waking whether or not

868
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,520
you've gotten light or not,
three hours after waking,

869
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,360
which probably correlates to
the rise in body temperature

870
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,120
sometime right around waking.

871
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,310
And the later afternoon,
usually 11 hours after waking

872
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,800
which is when temperature tends to peak.

873
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,140
So some people like to
exercise in the morning.

874
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,650
Some people like to
exercise in the afternoon.

875
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,200
It really depends.

876
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,290
I think for those of us
with very busy schedules,

877
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,870
it's advantageous to be
able to do your training

878
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,510
whenever you have the
opportunity to do it,

879
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,550
unless you can really
control your schedule.

880
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,900
And so I would never want
these recommendations

881
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,940
to seem like recommendations,
what I'm really describing

882
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,600
are some opportunities,
30 minutes after waking,

883
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,270
three hours after waking
or 11 hours after waking

884
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,980
has been shown at least in some studies

885
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,327
to optimize performance, reduce injury

886
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:18,447
and that sort of thing.

887
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:21,370
But you really have to figure
out what works for you.

888
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,000
A note about working out
first thing in the morning.

889
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,430
Last time we talked about
non-photo phase shifts.

890
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,280
If you exercise first
thing in the morning,

891
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,510
your body will start to develop
an anticipatory circuit.

892
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,190
There's actually plasticity
in these circadian circuits

893
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,680
that will lead you to want to wake up

894
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,430
at the particular time that you exercised

895
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,090
the previous three or four days.

896
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,660
So that can be a powerful tool

897
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,740
but you still want to get light exposure.

898
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,140
Because it turns out that
light and exercise converged,

899
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,290
so giving even bigger, wake up
signal to the brain and body.

900
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,070
So you might want to think about that.

901
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,320
Some people find if they
exercise late in the day

902
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,960
they have trouble sleeping

903
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,920
in general intense exercise does that,

904
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,030
whereas the kind of lower
intensity exercise doesn't.

905
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,060
I found some interesting literature

906
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,250
that talked about sleep need and exercise.

907
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,170
I found this fascinating that

908
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:17,210
if one is waking not feeling
rested and recovered from

909
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,860
and yet sleeping the same
amount that they typically have,

910
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,940
it's quite possible that
the intensity of exercise

911
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,430
in the proceeding two or
three days is too high.

912
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,650
Whereas if one can't recover

913
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,390
no matter how much sleep they get,

914
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,200
they're just sleepy all the time,

915
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,830
I realized these things are correlated

916
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,450
that the volume of
training might be too high.

917
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,920
Now I'm not an exercise scientist.

918
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,430
We should probably get Andy
Galpin or somebody else on here,

919
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,999
who's really an expert
in this kind of stuff.

920
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,760
I do realize as soon as
anyone talks about exercise

921
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,840
or nutrition publicly,

922
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,830
they're basically opening themselves up

923
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,930
to all sorts of challenges

924
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,070
because you can basically find support

925
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,100
for almost any protocol in the literature.

926
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,246
What I've looked at was
two journals in particular,

927
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:04,340
International Journal Chronobiology

928
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,030
and journal Biological Rhythms.

929
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,210
Excuse me, to assess these parameters

930
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,450
that I I've mentioned
just just a moment ago

931
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,500
because the studies tended
to be done in humans.

932
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,400
They were fairly recent and they came from

933
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,764
groups that I recognized as well as

934
00:40:21,764 --> 00:40:24,700
knowing that those
journals are peer reviewed.

935
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,550
Many of your questions were
about neural plasticity

936
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,450
which is the brain and nervous
system's ability to change

937
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,053
in response to experience.

938
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,450
There was a question
that asked whether or not

939
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,910
these really deep biological
mechanisms around wakefulness,

940
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,400
time of waking sleep, et cetera

941
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,820
were subject to neuroplasticity
and indeed they are.

942
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,700
Some of that plasticity is short-term

943
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,000
and some of it is more long-term.

944
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,380
There's a really good
analogy here which is,

945
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,610
if you happen to eat on
a very tight schedule

946
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,140
where every day say it
8:00 AM, noon and 7:00 PM

947
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,190
is when you eat your food
not suggesting you do this

948
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,470
but let's say you were to do
that for a couple of days.

949
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,800
After a few days,

950
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,150
you would start to
anticipate those meal times

951
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,300
where no matter where
you were in the world,

952
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,800
no matter what was going on in your life

953
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,100
about five to 10 minutes
before those meal times,

954
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,990
you would start to feel hungry
and even a little agitated,

955
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,900
which is your body's way

956
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,110
of trying to get you to forage for food.

957
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,690
And that's because of some peptide signals

958
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,260
that come from the
periphery from your body,

959
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,150
things like hypocretin norexin

960
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,920
that signal to the hypothalamus

961
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,650
and brainstem to make you active

962
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,490
and alert and look for
food and feel hungry.

963
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,070
So there's kind of an
anticipatory circuit,

964
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,010
that's a chemical circuit,
but eventually over time,

965
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,290
the neurons, the neural circuits

966
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,840
that control hypocretin orexin

967
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,350
would get tuned to the neural circuits

968
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:55,050
that are involved in eating
and maybe even smell and taste

969
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,960
to create a kind of eating circuit

970
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,400
that's unique to your
pattern, to your rhythms.

971
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,100
The same thing is true for
these waking and exercise

972
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,770
and other schedules, including
all trade-in schedules.

973
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,740
If you wake up in the morning

974
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,860
and start getting your
sunlight, you start exercising

975
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,170
in the morning or you
exercise in the afternoon,

976
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,360
pretty soon, your body will
start to anticipate that

977
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,050
and start to secrete
hormones and other signals

978
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,340
that prepare your body
for the ensuing activity

979
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,360
of waking up or going to sleep.

980
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,070
So if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,

981
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,890
even if that rhythm
isn't down to the minute,

982
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,160
you'll find that there's
plasticity in these circuits

983
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,050
and it becomes easier to wake up early.

984
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,270
If that's your thing or
exercise at a particular day

985
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,320
if that's your thing.

986
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,220
That's the beauty of neuroplasticity.

987
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,277
A number of people ask,

988
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,837
"What can I do to increase plasticity?"

989
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:48,310
And that really comes in two forms.

990
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,950
There's plasticity that
we can access in sleep

991
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,180
to improve rates of learning
and depth of learning

992
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,090
from the previous day or so.

993
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,370
And there's this an SDR
non-sleep deep breaths

994
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,350
that can be done without
sleeping, to improve rates

995
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,560
of learning and depth
of retention, et cetera.

996
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,650
So let's consider those both

997
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,860
and you can incorporate
these protocols if you like.

998
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,690
Again, these are based on
quality peer reviewed studies.

999
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,290
First, let's talk about learning in sleep.

1000
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,690
This is based on some work that

1001
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,930
I'll provide the reference for

1002
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,700
that was published in the journal Science.

1003
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,070
Excellent journal, Matt
Walker also talks about some

1004
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,910
of these studies done by others
in his book "Why We Sleep".

1005
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,300
The studies just to remind you are

1006
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,350
structured in he following
way an individual

1007
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,900
is brought into a laboratory, Lowe does a

1008
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,940
spatial memory task.

1009
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,870
So there tends to be a screen

1010
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,520
with a bunch of different
objects popping up on the screen

1011
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,480
in different locations.

1012
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,990
So it might be a Bulldog's
face that might be a cat,

1013
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,310
and it might be an Apple
than it might be a pen

1014
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,280
in different locations.

1015
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,010
And that sounds trivial easy

1016
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,690
but with time you can
imagine it gets pretty tough

1017
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,710
to come back a day later and remember,

1018
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,140
if something presented in a given location

1019
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,070
was something you've seen
before and whether or not

1020
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,150
it was presented in that
location or a different location.

1021
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,100
If you had enough objects
and changed locations enough,

1022
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,230
this can actually be quite difficult.

1023
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,640
In this study, the subjects either just

1024
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,510
went through the experiment
or a particular odor

1025
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,560
was released into the room
while they were learning

1026
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,080
or a tone was played in the
room while they were learning.

1027
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,870
And then during the
sleep of those subjects

1028
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,630
the following night and
the following night,

1029
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,320
so this was done repeatedly
for several nights,

1030
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,940
the same odor or tone was played

1031
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,913
while the subjects were sleeping.

1032
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,500
They did this in different stages of sleep

1033
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,770
non-REM sleep and rapid eye
movement, sleep REM sleep.

1034
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,235
They did this with just the tone in sleep.

1035
00:44:50,235 --> 00:44:54,500
If the subjects had the
odor but not the tone,

1036
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,520
they did it with putting the tone,

1037
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,300
if they had had the odor while learning.

1038
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,520
So basically all the controls,

1039
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,570
all the things you'd want
to see done to make sure

1040
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,960
that it wasn't some indirect
effects, a modulatory effect.

1041
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,793
Okay.

1042
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:10,640
And what they found was that
providing the same stimulus,

1043
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,590
the odor, if they
smelled an odor or a tone

1044
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,550
if the subjects heard
a tone while learning

1045
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,080
if they just delivered that odor or tone

1046
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,970
while the subject slept, rates of learning

1047
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,230
and retention of information
was significantly greater.

1048
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:27,160
This is pretty cool.

1049
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,077
What this means that you can
cue the subconscious brain,

1050
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:33,500
and the asleep brain to
learn particular things

1051
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,900
better and faster.

1052
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,210
So how might you implement this?

1053
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,430
Well, you could play
with this if you want.

1054
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,810
I don't see any real challenge

1055
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,930
to this provided the
odor and is a safe one

1056
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:44,867
and then doesn't wake you up

1057
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:49,140
and the tone is a safe one,
and doesn't wake you up.

1058
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,150
You could do this by having
a metronome, for instance,

1059
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,550
while I'm learning something,

1060
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,440
playing in the background
or particular music

1061
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,100
and then have that very
faintly while you sleep.

1062
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,140
So you could apply this
if you like and try this.

1063
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,310
There are a number of groups I think now

1064
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,460
that are trying this
using tactile stimulation.

1065
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,350
So slight vibration on
the wrist during learning

1066
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,900
and then the same vibration
on the wrist during sleep.

1067
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,370
It does not appear that
the sensory modality,

1068
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,550
whether or not it's odor or auditory tone

1069
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,900
or tactile stimulation,

1070
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,920
some as a sensory stimulation,
whether or not it matters.

1071
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,620
It's remarkable because it really shows

1072
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,880
that sleep is an extension
of the waking state.

1073
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,360
We've known that for a long time

1074
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,650
but this really tethers those two

1075
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,410
in a very meaningful and actionable way.

1076
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,190
So I think I'll report back to you

1077
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,540
as I learned more about these studies,

1078
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,140
but that's what I know
about them at this point.

1079
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,973
As long as we're there

1080
00:46:39,973 --> 00:46:41,120
we might as well talk about dreaming

1081
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,460
'cause I got so many
questions about dreams.

1082
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,220
A couple of you, we want to
ask me what their dreams meant.

1083
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,120
Look, I don't even know what
my dreams mean half the time.

1084
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,810
I occasionally will wake up
from a dream and remember it.

1085
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,650
If you want to remember
your dreams better,

1086
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,740
if you're somebody who has challenges

1087
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,220
remembering your dreams,
you can set your alarms

1088
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,450
that you wake up in the middle of this

1089
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,870
one of these 90 minute
cycles which toward morning

1090
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,500
tend to be occupied almost
exclusively by REM sleep.

1091
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,570
Remember early in the night,
you have less REM sleep

1092
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,160
than later in the night.

1093
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,830
But you want to get as
much sleep as you can

1094
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,663
'cause that's healthy.

1095
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,940
So I don't know that you
want to wake yourself up.

1096
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,200
Some people find that

1097
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,070
writing down their thoughts immediately

1098
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:19,980
first thing in the morning

1099
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,040
allows them to relater
spontaneously remember

1100
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,340
their dream they had.

1101
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,070
There's some literature on that.

1102
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,630
The meaning of dreams is a
little bit controversial.

1103
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,180
Some people believe
they have strong meaning

1104
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,410
other people believe that they can be

1105
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,720
just spontaneous firing of
neurons that were active

1106
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,680
in the waking state and
don't have any meaning.

1107
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,963
There are good data to show
that when you learn spatial,

1108
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,490
new spatial environments that
there's a replay of those

1109
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,640
environments, so-called place
cells that fire in your brain

1110
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,650
only when you enter a
particular environment,

1111
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,150
that those are replayed in
sleep in almost direct fashion

1112
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,560
to the way that things were activated

1113
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,510
when you were learning that spatial task.

1114
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,980
Dreams are fascinating, they're
were paralyzed during dreams

1115
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,790
which brings us to another question.

1116
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,519
Somebody asked about sleep paralysis.

1117
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,160
We are paralyzed for much of our sleep,

1118
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,160
so-called atonia so presumably

1119
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,890
so we don't act out our dreams.

1120
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,450
Some people wake up and
they're still paralyzed.

1121
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,250
I've actually had this happen to me

1122
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,900
not very many times, but a few times.

1123
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,890
And then they jolt themselves awake

1124
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,410
and it actually is quite terrifying.

1125
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,570
I can say from personal
experience to wake up

1126
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:33,220
be wide awake and you cannot
move your body at all.

1127
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,890
It's really quite frightening.

1128
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,000
There are a couple of
things that will increase

1129
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,560
the intrusion of atonia
into the wakeful state

1130
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,600
which is essentially
means you're waking up

1131
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,520
but you can't, you can't move.

1132
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,680
One is marijuana, THC, a
I'm not a marijuana smoker.

1133
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,230
I'm not a copper.

1134
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,730
I don't know the legality where you live.

1135
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,820
So I'm not saying one thing
or another about marijuana.

1136
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,695
I'm just, the fact that
I had that experience

1137
00:48:56,695 --> 00:49:00,360
without marijuana means that
it can happen regardless,

1138
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,950
but marijuana smokers, for whatever reason

1139
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,160
maybe it has something to do
with the cannabinoid receptors

1140
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,010
or the serotonin receptors
downstream of the motor pathways.

1141
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,520
I don't know.

1142
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,040
I couldn't find any literature on this

1143
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,100
but marijuana smokers
report, higher frequency

1144
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,340
of this kind of paralysis and wakefulness

1145
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,940
as you transition from
sleep to wakefulness.

1146
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,860
I suppose probably

1147
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,720
one could learn to get
comfortable with it.

1148
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,820
For me, it was terrifying, 'cause I'm just

1149
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,590
used to being able to
move my limbs fortunately

1150
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:33,127
and I wasn't able to,
and it's a quite a thing,

1151
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,830
let me tell you, okay.

1152
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,790
some other questions
about neuroplasticity.

1153
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,770
So the other form of neuroplasticity

1154
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,950
is not the neuroplasticity
that you're amplifying

1155
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:50,490
by listening to tones or
smelling odors in sleep,

1156
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,180
but the neuroplasticity
that you can access

1157
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,200
with non sleep deep rest.

1158
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,240
So NSDR, non sleep deep rest

1159
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,410
as well as short 20 minute naps,

1160
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,550
which are very close
to non sleep deep rest

1161
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,910
because people rarely drop

1162
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,090
into deep States of
sleep during short naps,

1163
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,053
unless they're very sleep deprived.

1164
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:12,940
NSDR has been shown to
increase rates of learning

1165
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,560
when done for 20 minute bouts for a proxy-

1166
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,470
to match an approximately
90 minute about of learning.

1167
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,710
So what am I talking about?

1168
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,810
90 minute cycles are
these ultradian cycles

1169
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,410
that I've talked about previously.

1170
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:30,530
And we tend to learn very well
by taking a 90 minute cycle

1171
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,570
transitioning into some focus
mode early in the cycle,

1172
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,700
and it's hard to focus and then deep focus

1173
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,340
and learning feels almost
like agitation and strain

1174
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,570
and then by the end of
that 90 minute cycle,

1175
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,740
it becomes very hard to maintain focus

1176
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,700
and learn more information.

1177
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,040
There's a study published
in Cell Reports last year.

1178
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,180
Great journal, excellent
paper showing that

1179
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,290
20 minute naps or light sleep

1180
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,320
of a sort of non sleep deep
rest taken immediately after

1181
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,680
or close to it, doesn't have to be

1182
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,620
immediately after you
finished the last sentence

1183
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,120
of learning or whatever
it is, or bar of music.

1184
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,230
But you know, a couple of
minutes after transitioning

1185
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,960
to a period of non sleep deep rest,

1186
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,780
where you're turning off the
analysis of duration path

1187
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,430
and outcome has been shown
to accelerate learning

1188
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,050
to a significant degree.

1189
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,760
Both the amount of information

1190
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,720
and the retention of that information.

1191
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,320
So that's pretty cool,

1192
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,240
because this is a
cost-free, drug-free way of

1193
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,600
accelerating learning without
having to get more sleep.

1194
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,690
But simply by introducing
these 20 minute bouts.

1195
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,730
I would encourage people
if they want to try this

1196
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:41,270
to consider the 20 minutes
per every 90 minutes

1197
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,780
of ultradian learning cycle,
there you're incorporating

1198
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,410
a number of different
neuroscience backed tools

1199
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:50,090
90 minute cycles for focused learning.

1200
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,620
It could be motor, it could be cognitive,

1201
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,390
it could be musical, whatever,
and then transitioned

1202
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,360
to a 20 minute non sleep
deep rest protocol.

1203
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,520
I just want to cue you the
fact that in last` episode

1204
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,210
in the caption on
YouTube, we provided links

1205
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,026
to two different yoga nidra,
non sleep deep rest protocols

1206
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:08,880
as well as hypnosis protocols
that are clinically backed

1207
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,660
from my colleague David Spiegel

1208
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,520
at Stanford Psychiatry Department.

1209
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,540
All those resources are free.

1210
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,540
There are also a lot of other
hypnosis scripts out there.

1211
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,150
I like the ones from Michael Sealey

1212
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,300
S-E-A-L, I think it's
E-Y, maybe it's just L-Y,

1213
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,090
you can find them easily on YouTube,

1214
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,310
clinical hypnosis scripts
meaning not stage hypnosis.

1215
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,600
They're not designed to
get you to do anything.

1216
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
In fact they're just designed to

1217
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,320
help rewire your brain circuitry.

1218
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,620
Now, how does hypnosis work that way?

1219
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,770
This has a lot to do with sleep because

1220
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:43,980
it engages neuro-plasticity
by bringing together

1221
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,390
two things that normally are
separate from one another,

1222
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,240
one is the alert focused wakeful state

1223
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,750
where you activate the learning.

1224
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,330
And then there's the deep
rest where the actual

1225
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:57,160
reconfiguration of the neurons
and synopsis takes place.

1226
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,340
Hypnosis brings both the focus
and the deep rest component

1227
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,020
into the same compartment of time.

1228
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,970
It's a very unique state in that way.

1229
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,050
So hypnosis kind of
maximizes the learning about

1230
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,070
and the non sleep deep
breasts bow and combines them.

1231
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:16,740
But of course that requires
some guidance from a script

1232
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,050
or from a hypnotist
clinically, a trained hypnotist

1233
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,040
and it becomes hard to
acquire detailed information.

1234
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,010
It's more about shifts in state,
like fear to states of calm

1235
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:33,010
or smoking to quitting smoking,
anxiety around a trauma

1236
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,660
to release of anxiety around a trauma

1237
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,470
rather than specific information
learned in hypnosis, okay?

1238
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,050
So hypnosis seems more about
modulating the circuits

1239
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,480
that underlie state as opposed
to specific information.

1240
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,720
Although I would not be surprised

1241
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,340
if there weren't certain forms of hypnosis

1242
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,550
that could increase retention and learning

1243
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,210
of specific information, but I'm not aware

1244
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,570
of any of those protocols out there yet.

1245
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,920
Which brings us to the
next thing about learning

1246
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,399
and plasticity which is
nootropics, AKA smart drugs.

1247
00:54:04,399 --> 00:54:05,770
[sighs]

1248
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,170
This is a big topic that sigh was

1249
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,070
a sigh of concern about
how to address nootropics

1250
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:16,000
in a thorough enough, but
thoughtful enough way.

1251
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,150
Look, I have a lot of
thoughts about nootropics.

1252
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,137
First of all, it means
smart drugs, I believe.

1253
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,700
And I don't like that phrase because

1254
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,430
let's just take a step back
and think about exercise.

1255
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,180
You just say, I want to
be more physically fit.

1256
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,240
What does that mean?

1257
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,750
Does it mean I would ask for
more specificity, I'd say,

1258
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:36,470
Do you want to be stronger?

1259
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:39,340
Okay, maybe you need to lift
heavier objects progressively.

1260
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,300
Do you want more endurance

1261
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,230
very different protocol
to access endurance.

1262
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,380
Do you want flexibility?

1263
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,980
Do you want explosiveness or suppleness?

1264
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,670
Huge range of things that
we call physical fitness.

1265
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,700
Maybe you want all of those.

1266
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,780
If we were talking about emotional fitness

1267
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,350
we would say, well,
inability to feel empathy

1268
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,500
but probably also to
disengage from empathy

1269
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,540
because you don't want to be tethered

1270
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,010
to other people's emotions all the time.

1271
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:04,990
That's not healthy either.

1272
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,100
You would think about being able

1273
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,780
to access a range of
emotions, but for some people

1274
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,610
their range into the sadness
regime is really quite vast

1275
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,360
but their range into the happiness regime

1276
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,330
might be kind of limited.

1277
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,300
For other people who are in a manic state,

1278
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,230
it might be, they can
access all that happy stuff

1279
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,980
but not the sadder stuff.

1280
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,938
So I'm speaking by way of analogy here.

1281
00:55:26,938 --> 00:55:30,990
But if we say we're
talking about cognitive

1282
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,950
and cognitive abilities we have to ask,

1283
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:38,010
okay, creativity, memory.

1284
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,200
We tend to associate
intelligence with memory.

1285
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,900
And I think this goes
back to like spelling bees

1286
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,531
or something, the ability to
retain a lot of information

1287
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:48,500
and just regurgitate information

1288
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,830
which will get you some distance

1289
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:51,660
in some disciplines of life.

1290
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,500
But it won't allow you creative thinking,

1291
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,670
it's necessary for creative thinking.

1292
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,830
You need a knowledge base, right?

1293
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:00,490
You can't just look up everything
on Google, despite what

1294
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,830
you know, certain educators
or so-called educators say,

1295
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,260
you need a database so that
you can have the raw materials

1296
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,440
with which to be creative.

1297
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,660
So necessary to have memory

1298
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,040
but not sufficient to be creative, right?

1299
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,310
The creative could have a
poor memory for certain things

1300
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,770
but certainly not for everything.

1301
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,330
They can't have anterograde
and retrograde amnesia.

1302
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,130
They'd be like the
goldfish that every time

1303
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,430
around the tank, it, you know

1304
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,456
I can't remember where it's at.

1305
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:27,790
I actually don't know that
they've ever done that experiment

1306
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,530
by the way, but you know,
so no disrespect to goldfish

1307
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,410
but you know, so you get the idea.

1308
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,140
You've got creativity, you have memory,

1309
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,810
you have the ability
to task switch, right?

1310
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,420
You have the ability to

1311
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,090
strategy development, strategy implement.

1312
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,880
So the problem I have with
the concept of a nootropic

1313
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,200
or a smart drug is it's not
specific as to what cognitive

1314
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,700
algorithm you're trying to engage.

1315
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,590
We need more specificity.

1316
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:57,150
That said, there are elements to learning

1317
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,930
that we've discussed here before

1318
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,070
that are very concrete things like

1319
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,050
the ability to focus and put the blinders

1320
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,010
on to everything else that's happening in

1321
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,700
around you and in your head mainly, right?

1322
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,440
Distractions about things
you should be doing,

1323
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,310
could be doing or might be doing

1324
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,200
and focus on what you need to do.

1325
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,540
And then that's required for
triggering the acetylcholine

1326
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,440
neuromodulator that will then allow you to

1327
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,210
highlight the particular
synopsis that will then

1328
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,890
later change in sleep.

1329
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,590
So no nootropic allows
you to bypass the need

1330
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,900
for sleep in deep rest.

1331
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,320
That's important to understand.

1332
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,320
So I daydream about a day
when people will be able

1333
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:42,250
to access compounds that are safe,

1334
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,500
that will allow them to
learn better meaning,

1335
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,270
to access information, focus better,

1336
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,400
as well as to sleep better
and activate the plasticity

1337
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,970
from the learning about.

1338
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,580
Right now most nootropics

1339
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,440
tend to bundle a bunch of things together.

1340
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,620
Most of them include some
form of stimulant, caffeine.

1341
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,780
Episode two, I'll tell you more probably

1342
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,370
than you ever wanted
to know about caffeine,

1343
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,600
adenosine and how that works.

1344
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,500
So refer there for how caffeine works.

1345
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,790
But stimulants will allow
you to increase focus

1346
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,550
up to a particular point.

1347
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,360
If you have too little
alertness in your system,

1348
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,310
you can't focus, too much however,

1349
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,460
you start to cliff and focus drifts, okay?

1350
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,130
So you can't just ingest more
stimulant to be more focused.

1351
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,570
It doesn't work that way.

1352
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,030
Most nootropics also
include things that increase

1353
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,420
or a desire to increase acetylcholine.

1354
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,100
Things like alpha GPC and
other things of that sort.

1355
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,850
And indeed, there's some evidence

1356
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,300
that they can increase acetylcholine.

1357
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,300
I refer you again to
examine.com the website to

1358
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,350
evaluate any supplements or
compounds for their safety

1359
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:47,030
and their effects in humans
and animals, free website

1360
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,950
as well as with links to studies.

1361
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,770
So we need the focus component.

1362
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,990
We need the alertness component.

1363
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,840
The alertness component
comes from epinephrin,

1364
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,280
traditionally from caffeine stimulation.

1365
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,140
The acetylcholine stimulation
traditionally comes

1366
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,860
from Coleen donors or alpha
GPC, things of that sort.

1367
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,030
And then you would want to
have some sort of off switch,

1368
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,360
because anything that's going to really

1369
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,390
stimulate your alertness,
that then provides a crash.

1370
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:14,030
That crash is not a crash

1371
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,500
into the deep kind of restful slumber

1372
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,540
that you would want for learning,

1373
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,573
it's a crash into the kind of,

1374
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,870
let's just call it lopsided
sleep, meaning it's deep sleep

1375
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:29,360
but it lacks certain
spindles and other elements

1376
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,230
of the physiology sleep spindles,

1377
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,730
that really engage the learning process

1378
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,930
and the reconfiguration of synopsis.

1379
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:40,130
So right now, my stance
on nootropics is that

1380
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:45,130
maybe, maybe for occasional
use, provided it's safe for you,

1381
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,500
I'm not recommending it, but in general

1382
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,610
it tends to use more of a shotgun approach

1383
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,708
than is probably going to be useful

1384
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:56,940
for learning and memory in the long run.

1385
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,670
A lot of people ask about
Modafinil or armodafinil

1386
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,570
which was designed for
treatment of narcolepsy.

1387
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,490
So right there, it tells
you it's a stimulant.

1388
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:05,900
And yes, there is evidence, it
will improve learning memory.

1389
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,390
Modafinil is very expensive.

1390
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,880
Last time I checked our Modafinil

1391
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,620
I think is the recent
released a generic version

1392
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,990
of this that's far less expensive.

1393
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,090
Most of these things look
a lot like amphetamine

1394
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:21,410
and many of them have the
potential for addiction

1395
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,133
or can be habit forming.

1396
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,410
But more importantly,
a lot of those things

1397
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,830
also can create metabolic
effects by disruption

1398
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,510
to insulin receptors and so forth.

1399
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,450
So you want to approach those with a

1400
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,750
strong sense of caution.

1401
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,980
Now, there are the milder
things that act as nootropics

1402
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,453
that I mentioned, some
of them like alpha GPC.

1403
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:42,323
Some people like Gingko.

1404
01:00:42,323 --> 01:00:45,760
Gingko gives me vicious
headaches, so I don't take it.

1405
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,720
So people really differ.

1406
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,100
Last podcast, I recommend
magnesium threonate

1407
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,010
if you were exploring supplements

1408
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,640
I'm not recommending anything directly.

1409
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,620
I'm just saying if you're
exploring supplements,

1410
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,636
magnesium threonate seems
among the magnesiums

1411
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:05,250
to be one of the more
bioavailable and useful for sleep.

1412
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,550
I recommended it actually
to a good friend of mine,

1413
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:11,350
it gave him at very low dose,
he had stomach issues with it.

1414
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:12,870
He just had to simply stop taking it.

1415
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,027
So there's variability there.

1416
01:01:14,027 --> 01:01:16,380
You just, it gave him
some stomach cramping

1417
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,840
and just didn't feel good on it.

1418
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,580
Stopped it, he felt better.

1419
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,620
Other people take magnesium
threonate and feel great.

1420
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,040
I was asked, do magnesium need to be taken

1421
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,210
with or without food or before sleep?

1422
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,110
If you're going to go that route

1423
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,380
it should be taken 30 to
60 minutes before sleep,

1424
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,070
'cause it's designed to make you sleepy.

1425
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:36,460
And I'm not aware that it
has to be taken with food,

1426
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,520
but again all of this has
to be run by your doctor

1427
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,240
and this is your healthcare to govern not,

1428
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,820
these are not strict
recommendations so look into it.

1429
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:49,820
But magnesium threonate,
most people I recommend it to

1430
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,190
have benefit from it tremendously.

1431
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,300
Some people can't tolerate
it, so you have to find out.

1432
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,320
There were a number of questions
about other supplements

1433
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,700
designed to access deep sleep,

1434
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,830
in part to access neuroplasticity,

1435
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,780
but now I'm just sort of
transitioning from neuroplasticity

1436
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,160
to these compounds that
can regulate sleep.

1437
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,280
One of them that I discussed
at the end of the last podcast,

1438
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,270
I got a lot of questions about is apigenin

1439
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,600
A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.

1440
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,800
If you will look in the literature

1441
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,310
the way it works is it
increases some of the enzymes

1442
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,130
associated with GABA metabolism.

1443
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:24,680
It actually, GABA's an
inhibitory neurotransmitter.

1444
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,330
It's the neurotransmitter
that is increased

1445
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:31,010
after a couple alcohol
drinks containing alcohol.

1446
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,733
And that shut down the forebrain.

1447
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,540
Apigenin is a derivative of the camomile.

1448
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,350
I think that the proper pronunciation

1449
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,690
of this is metric caria kemo mila.

1450
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,523
Although I always feel like

1451
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:44,963
I should be using a Spanish accent.

1452
01:02:44,963 --> 01:02:47,110
Whenever I say something like that

1453
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:49,360
other related things that
impact the GABA system

1454
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,900
and increase GABA or
things like passion flower

1455
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,147
which is [speaks in foreign language].

1456
01:02:54,728 --> 01:02:57,340
[chuckles] I don't know why
the Italian, is that Italian.

1457
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,770
Anyway, my Italian
colleagues, please forgive me.

1458
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:02,540
I have some very close Italian friends

1459
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:03,740
and colleagues in Genoa.

1460
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,640
I butchered the Italian, sorry.

1461
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,640
In any event apigenin and
passion flower found in a lot of,

1462
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,760
a lot of supplements designed
to increase sleepiness

1463
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,640
and sleep because, and
they work presumably

1464
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,870
because they increase GABA.

1465
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,110
Actually they work on chloride channels

1466
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:22,400
rather than give you a whole lecture

1467
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,850
on membrane biophysics in neurons.

1468
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:27,230
I'll just say that when
neurons are really active

1469
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:31,780
it's because sodium ions,
salt rushes into the cells

1470
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,720
and causes them to fire electrically.

1471
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,720
The cells tend to become
less active as more chloride

1472
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,903
which is a negatively charged ion.

1473
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,880
This is probably taking
some of you back to the

1474
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,260
either the wonderful times

1475
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,330
or traumas of high school physics.

1476
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:48,140
The chloride is negatively charged so,

1477
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,420
it tends to make cells
less electrically positive,

1478
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,120
'cause carries a negative charge

1479
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,510
and hyperpolarizes the neuron.

1480
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:58,610
So apigenin works through
these increasing the activity

1481
01:03:58,610 --> 01:03:59,720
of these chloride channels.

1482
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,110
Passionflower works by
increasing the activity

1483
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,550
of these chloride channels
and GABA transmission.

1484
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,380
It tends to increase this
inhibitory neurotransmitter

1485
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,530
that shuts off our thinking

1486
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:11,633
our analysis of duration path and outcome.

1487
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,270
So if you're going to explore these things

1488
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:16,390
I suggest you at least know how they work.

1489
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:19,330
You at least go to examined.com

1490
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:21,250
that you talked to your doctor about them.

1491
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,780
Some people asked about serotonin

1492
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,860
for getting to sleep and staying asleep.

1493
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,610
Now I understand the rationale here.

1494
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,730
Just like I understand the
rationale of taking something

1495
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,910
like Macuna Purina or
L-DOPA to increase dopamine

1496
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:36,810
but sometimes what works on paper

1497
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:38,940
doesn't really work in the real world.

1498
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,130
I personally have tried
taking a supplement

1499
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,260
which was Al tryptophan, which
is the precursor to serotonin

1500
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,090
or five HTP, which is
designed to increase,

1501
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,650
it is serotonin basically.

1502
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:52,400
You're just a one biochemical step away

1503
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,140
from actually taking actual serotonin.

1504
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,860
And I'll be honest the sleep that I had

1505
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,000
with increased serotonin

1506
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,780
by way of tryptophan or
five HTP was dreadful.

1507
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,660
I fell asleep almost immediately.

1508
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,660
You say, well, that's great.

1509
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,260
And 90 minutes later, I woke up

1510
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,470
and I couldn't sleep almost for 48 hours.

1511
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,540
Now that was me, I have
a pretty sensitive system

1512
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,240
to certain things and not to other things.

1513
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,530
Some people love these things.

1514
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,390
So you really have to be thoughtful

1515
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,510
and explore them with
that kind of awareness

1516
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:22,080
of being thoughtful and
realizing that what works for you

1517
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,110
might not work for everybody

1518
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,810
and what works for everybody
might not work for you.

1519
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:26,643
Okay?

1520
01:05:26,643 --> 01:05:27,760
I'd like to continue by talking about

1521
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,410
the role of temperature
in sleep, accessing sleep,

1522
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,983
staying asleep and wakefulness.

1523
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:38,380
But first I want to tell a joke.

1524
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,460
Because I think this joke

1525
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,650
really captures some of the
critical things to understand

1526
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:45,363
about any self-experimentation
that you might do.

1527
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,270
So this is a story that was told to me

1528
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,180
by a colleague of mine who's
now a professor of Caltech

1529
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,273
not to be named.

1530
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,130
So there's a scientist
and they're in their lab.

1531
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,070
And they're trying to understand

1532
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,130
how the nervous system works.

1533
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:04,804
So they go over to a tank
and they pick up a frog,

1534
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:08,200
and they take the frog and
they put it down on the table

1535
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,440
And they clap.
[claps]

1536
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,483
And the frog jumps.

1537
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:16,350
So they think for awhile,
they pick up the frog, okay.

1538
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:20,180
They go over to the
cabinet and they take out

1539
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:24,310
a little bit of a paralytic
drug and they inject it locally

1540
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:29,310
into the back leg, set
it down and clap. [claps]

1541
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,910
And the frog jumps,

1542
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,460
but it kind of like jumps
to the side a little bit.

1543
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,430
They pick it up, they inject the paralytic

1544
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,560
into the other back leg.

1545
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,110
They clap again, the frog jumps,

1546
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,780
but it really doesn't jump well that time,

1547
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,483
it kind of drags itself forward.

1548
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,140
So they pick it up and
they inject the paralytic

1549
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,350
into the remaining two legs.

1550
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:54,350
They set it down and they clap
and the frog doesn't jump.

1551
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,473
And they go,

1552
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:58,847
"Oh my goodness! The legs
are used for hearing."

1553
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,330
Now they publish the paper.

1554
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,610
Paper comes out in a great
journal, news releases.

1555
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,470
It's a really big deal,
their career takes off.

1556
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,750
20 years later, a really
smart graduate student

1557
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:15,230
comes along and says, "Yeah
but that's loss of function.

1558
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,410
It doesn't really show gain of function."

1559
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,853
So let's take a closer look.

1560
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:22,810
So they repeat the first
experiment and checks out,

1561
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:26,540
everything happens the same
way, but then they take the frog

1562
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:32,210
and they inject a drug into
all four legs that turns off

1563
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:34,180
the paralytic, right?

1564
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,600
It's an antagonist.

1565
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,270
They set the frog down, they
clap, and the frog jumps

1566
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,220
and they go, "Oh my goodness! It's true.

1567
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:45,220
The legs really are for hearing."

1568
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:48,970
Now, first of all, I want
to make the point that

1569
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,950
this is not to illustrate that science

1570
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,900
is not a good practice, it is.

1571
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,510
We need to do loss of function

1572
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,750
and gain and function experiments.

1573
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:59,400
But just to show that
correlation and causation

1574
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,260
is complicated.

1575
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,470
You need to do a variety
of control experiments,

1576
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:04,840
and you really need to figure
out what works for you.

1577
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,440
And so while science can
provide answers about what works

1578
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,420
under very controlled
conditions, it doesn't

1579
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,140
and can never address all the situations

1580
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,670
in which a given compound,

1581
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,819
a given practice will or won't work.

1582
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:19,409
And it's not just individual variability

1583
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:21,160
is that there are a number
of different factors.

1584
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,979
You all of course know
that light can activate

1585
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,049
and shift your circadian
rhythm, but so can exercise,

1586
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,290
so can food.

1587
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:28,979
The last point I want to
make is an important one,

1588
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,049
which is that no frogs were hurt

1589
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:34,020
in the telling of this joke.

1590
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,680
Okay. So let's continue.

1591
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,420
I want to talk about temperature.

1592
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:40,020
Temperature is super
interesting as it relates to

1593
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:43,313
circadian rhythms and
wakefulness and sleep.

1594
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:48,169
First let's take a look
at what's happening to our

1595
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,939
body temperature across
each 24-hour cycle.

1596
01:08:51,939 --> 01:08:54,819
In general, our temperature
tends to be lowest

1597
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:59,659
right around 4:00 AM and starts
creeping up around 6:00 AM,

1598
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:04,660
8:00 AM and peaks sometime
between 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.

1599
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:07,959
Now that varies from person
to person, but in general

1600
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,850
if we were to continuously
monitor or occasionally monitor

1601
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,970
temperature that's what we would see.

1602
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,979
Now what's interesting is
that even in the absence

1603
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:19,609
of any light cues or meal
cues, we would have a shift.

1604
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:22,129
We would have an oscillation
or a rhythm in our temperature.

1605
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,490
They would go from high to low.

1606
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,710
This is why the idea that we're all 96.8

1607
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,899
and that's our correct temperature.

1608
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:30,529
Forget that. That is no longer true.

1609
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:31,619
It never was true.

1610
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:34,260
It depends on what time of
day you measure temperature.

1611
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,359
However, there is a range
which is within normal range,

1612
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,103
I think most of us associate
fever with somewhere around

1613
01:09:40,104 --> 01:09:42,880
100, 101 103, that's concerning.

1614
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,000
And we will be very concerned

1615
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,630
if temperature drop too low as well.

1616
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:50,170
The way that the temperature
rhythm that's indogenous,

1617
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,740
that's within us and
rhythmic no matter what,

1618
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:57,100
the way it gets anchored to
the pattern I described before,

1619
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,560
or being lowest at 4:00 AM
and increasing again around,

1620
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,550
through the day until about
four to 6:00 PM is by way

1621
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:09,460
of entrainment or matching
to some external cue,

1622
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:13,360
which is almost always going
to be light, but also exercise.

1623
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,150
Now you may have experienced
this temperature rhythm

1624
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:20,860
and how quickly it can become uninterested

1625
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,520
or it can fall out of entrainment.

1626
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,940
Here's an experiment I
wouldn't want you to do

1627
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,150
but you've probably
experienced this before,

1628
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:31,470
where you wake up, it's sunny outside,

1629
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:33,810
and maybe you have some email
or some things to take care of

1630
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:35,440
or maybe you didn't sleep
that well the night before

1631
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,710
and so you stay in doors.

1632
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:39,380
You don't change anything
about your breakfast,

1633
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,670
you don't change anything about
your within home temperature

1634
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,970
or anything like that.

1635
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,930
And somewhere right
around 10 or 11 o'clock

1636
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,920
you start feeling kind of
chilled, like you're cold.

1637
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,290
Well, what happened was
the oscillators, the clocks

1638
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,017
in your various tissues that
are governed by temperature

1639
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,720
and circadian rhythm are
starting to split away

1640
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,920
from your central clock mechanisms.

1641
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,340
So it's actually important

1642
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,800
that your temperature match day length.

1643
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,633
Now there's another way

1644
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:08,490
in which temperature matches,
oh daytime, excuse me.

1645
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:09,910
There's also an important way

1646
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,730
in which temperature matches
day length in general

1647
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:15,620
as days get longer, it
tends to be hotter out.

1648
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:18,340
Not always, but in general,
that's the way it is.

1649
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,770
And as days get shorter, it
tends to be colder outside.

1650
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:26,330
So temperature and day length
are also linked metabolically.

1651
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:29,840
They're linked biologically
they're linked, excuse me,

1652
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,370
and atmospherically they're linked

1653
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,700
for the reason that we talked about before

1654
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,767
about duration of day length

1655
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:37,470
and other climate features and so forth.

1656
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,520
So one of the most powerful things

1657
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,810
about setting your
circadian rhythm properly

1658
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:44,240
is that your temperature
will start to fall

1659
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,440
into a regular rhythm.

1660
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,460
And that temperature
has a very strong effect

1661
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,480
on things like metabolism

1662
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,890
and when you will feel
most willing and interested

1663
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:57,080
in exercising, typically
the willingness to exercise

1664
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,290
and engage in any kind of
activity mental or physical

1665
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,640
is going to be when that rise
in temperature is steepest.

1666
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,260
When the slope of that line is greatest.

1667
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,080
That's why 30 minutes after waking

1668
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,340
is one of those key windows,

1669
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,127
as well as three hours after waking.

1670
01:12:10,127 --> 01:12:12,380
And then when temperature actually peaks

1671
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:17,380
which is generally, generally
about 11 hours after waking.

1672
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:21,760
So this is why we say that
temperature and circadian rhythm

1673
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,350
are linked but they're actually
even more linked than that.

1674
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,920
We've talked before about
how light enters the eye,

1675
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,160
triggers activation of
these melanopsin cells,

1676
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,430
which then triggers activation

1677
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,960
of the super charismatic nucleus,

1678
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,690
the master circadian clock.

1679
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,660
And then I always say the
master circadian clock

1680
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
informs all the cells
and tissues of your body

1681
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,800
and puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.

1682
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,160
But what I've never answered
was how it actually puts them

1683
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,690
into that rhythm.

1684
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:48,400
And it does it two ways.

1685
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,220
One is it secretes a peptide.

1686
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,990
And peptide is just a
little protein that floats

1687
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:54,700
through the bloodstream
and signals to the cells.

1688
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,860
Okay, we're tuning your clock.

1689
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:57,810
Kind of like a little,
we know watch store,

1690
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:00,340
the watch store owner
would tune the clocks.

1691
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,730
But the other way is it
synchronizes the temperature

1692
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:05,860
under which those cells exist.

1693
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:08,750
So temperature is actually the effector

1694
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,690
of the circadian rhythm.

1695
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:12,900
Now this is really important because

1696
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,410
changes in temperature by way
of exercise, by way of eating,

1697
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,800
but especially by way of exercise

1698
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,250
can start to shift our circadian
rhythm pretty dramatically.

1699
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,960
But let's even go to in
a more extreme example.

1700
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,200
Nowadays, there's some
interest in cold showers

1701
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,900
and ice baths, not everybody
is doing this I realize.

1702
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,240
People seem to either
love this or hate this.

1703
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,940
I don't mind the cold dunk thing.

1704
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,330
I get regular about this from
time to time and I'll do it.

1705
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,930
I haven't been doing it recently.

1706
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,810
It's always painful to do
the first couple of times

1707
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,310
then you get kind of used to it.

1708
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:46,000
However, I've taken people to
a cold, dunk or an ice bath.

1709
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,320
I have a family member who wouldn't get in

1710
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,010
literally passed her toes.

1711
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:52,000
She was like, this is
just too aversive for me.

1712
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,570
Some people really like the
cold, people very tremendously.

1713
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:57,890
Getting into an ice
bath is very interesting

1714
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:01,570
because you have a rebound
increase in thermogenesis.

1715
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,760
Now you should know from
the previous episode

1716
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,060
that as that temperature increases,

1717
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,020
it will shift your circadian rhythm

1718
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,170
and which direction it
shifts your circadian rhythm

1719
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,410
will depend on whether
or not you're doing it

1720
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:12,810
during the daytime or late in the day.

1721
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,950
If you do it after 8:00 PM,

1722
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,760
it's going to make your day longer, right?

1723
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,360
Because your body and your central clocks

1724
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,750
are used to temperature
going up early in the day

1725
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,830
and throughout the day and
peaking in the afternoon.

1726
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,150
If you then increase that further

1727
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,120
or you simply increase it
over its baseline at 8:00 PM

1728
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,270
after temperature was already falling,

1729
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,590
even if it's just by a half a
degree or a couple of degrees

1730
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:37,830
or you do that with exercise

1731
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,410
doesn't have to be with the ice bath,

1732
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:42,960
you are extending, you are
shifting forward your phase,

1733
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,320
delaying your clock.

1734
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,960
You're convincing your clock

1735
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,360
and therefore the rest of your body

1736
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,550
that the day is still going, right?

1737
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,720
You you're giving it the
perception, the cellar

1738
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,707
and physiological perception
that the day is getting longer.

1739
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:57,610
And you will want to
naturally stay up later

1740
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,270
and wake up later.

1741
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,260
Now you might say, "Wait

1742
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,720
I do an ice bath late at
night, and I feel great.

1743
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,340
And I fall deeply asleep."

1744
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,680
Well, cold can trigger
the release of melatonin.

1745
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,510
There's a rebound increase in melatonin.

1746
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,790
So that could be the cause of that effect.

1747
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:13,350
You have to see what works for you,

1748
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:17,520
but if you do the ice bath early
in the day and then get out

1749
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,070
you will experience a more rapid rise

1750
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,890
or cold shower early in
the day, a more rapid rise

1751
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:27,170
in your body temperature that
will phase advance your clock

1752
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:30,340
and make it easier to get
up early the following day.

1753
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,750
So for those of you that are
having trouble getting up

1754
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,610
and this is going to
almost sound laughable

1755
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,450
but a cold shower first
thing in the morning

1756
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:40,300
will wake you up, but that's
waking you up in the short term

1757
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,630
because of a different mechanism

1758
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,010
which I'll talk about in a moment,

1759
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,680
but it also is shifting your clock,

1760
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,250
it's phase advancing your clock

1761
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,970
in a way that makes you
more likely to get up

1762
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,420
earlier the next day, okay?

1763
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:54,670
So in other words,
increasing your temperature

1764
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:59,100
by getting in an ice bath
or cold shower or exercising

1765
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:03,040
which causes a compensatory
increase in body temperature.

1766
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,230
Think about the normal
pattern of body temperature.

1767
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:09,240
Low around 4:35 AM starts to
peak right around waking start,

1768
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,660
excuse me, starts to
increase right around waking

1769
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,880
then steep slope, steep slope to a peak

1770
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,370
around four to 6:00 PM and then drops off.

1771
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,500
If you introduce an
increase in body temperature

1772
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,023
by way of cold exposure early in the day,

1773
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,190
let's say 6:00 AM or 5:00 AM

1774
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:27,030
if you're masochistic enough
to get into a cold shower

1775
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,760
at that time more power to you,

1776
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,780
it's going to make, you want
to wake up about half hour

1777
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:34,200
to an hour earlier the next
day than you normally would.

1778
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,060
Whereas if you do it while
your temperature is falling,

1779
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,450
it will tend to delay and
make your body perceive

1780
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,330
as if the day is getting longer.

1781
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,520
These are phase advances and phase delays.

1782
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,610
We're going to get into
this in far more detail

1783
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:48,750
when we talk about jet lag
and shift work in episode four

1784
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,300
as well as other other things.

1785
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,240
But temperature is,

1786
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,910
again is not just one tool to manipulate

1787
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:58,840
wake up time and circadian
rhythm and metabolism.

1788
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,160
It is the effector.

1789
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,280
It is the way that the
central circadian clock

1790
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,430
impacts all the cells
and tissues of your body.

1791
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,130
If you want to read further about this

1792
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:08,170
and you're really curious
about the role of temperature

1793
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,780
work by Joe Takahashi

1794
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:12,510
who used to be at Northwestern University

1795
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,409
and is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,

1796
01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:19,220
incredible scientist and
has really worked out

1797
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,780
a lot of the mechanisms around temperature

1798
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,670
in circadian rhythms.

1799
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:23,950
You can just Google his name

1800
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:26,413
and you'll see a whole
bunch of studies there.

1801
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,180
I want to talk about
cold and cold exposure

1802
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,870
because there's a great
misconception about this

1803
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,820
that actually you can
leverage once you understand

1804
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,890
how to use cold to either
increase thermogenesis

1805
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:42,070
and fat loss, metabolism,

1806
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:45,100
or you can use it for
stress, mitigation and mood.

1807
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,420
And it really depends
on one simple feature

1808
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,820
of how you approach the
ice bath or cold shower.

1809
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:54,040
If you get into an ice bath or cold shower

1810
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,350
and you are calming yourself
you're actively calming

1811
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,480
the autonomic nervous system.

1812
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,970
Maybe through some deep breathing,

1813
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,620
maybe through visualization,
maybe you sing a song.

1814
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,230
You know, people do this stuff.

1815
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:05,330
They use various tools.

1816
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,090
Some people find paying attention

1817
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,620
to an external stimulus is more helpful.

1818
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,080
You know, thinking about something

1819
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,410
not the experience of the cold,

1820
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:14,810
other people find that
directly experiencing the cold

1821
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:18,293
in its most intense form and
kind of "going into the cold"

1822
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,690
is the best way to approach it.

1823
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,780
It really varies for people.

1824
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,230
There's no right or wrong
way to go about this.

1825
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:28,140
But the goal of using cold
exposure for stress inoculation

1826
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:30,850
and to raise your stress threshold

1827
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,910
to be able to tolerate heightened levels

1828
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:36,650
of real life stress, not the
ice bath, but real life stress

1829
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,100
like work stress and
relational stress, et cetera

1830
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:43,900
is by suppressing the activation

1831
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,410
of the so-called
sympathetic nervous system,

1832
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:48,383
meaning the alertness or stress system.

1833
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,670
That involves buffering

1834
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:53,750
or trying to resist the shiver response.

1835
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,040
The shiver response is
an autonomic response

1836
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,110
designed to generate heat, presumably,

1837
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,000
and actually that is what it does

1838
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,160
in order to counter the cold.

1839
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:05,800
So when you use cold exposure

1840
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,390
and you're kind of muscling through it,

1841
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,130
or you're learning to relax within it

1842
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,470
as a form of stress inoculation,

1843
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:14,600
that's great and works
quite well for that purpose.

1844
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,950
And there's a reason why
cold exposure is used

1845
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:20,630
in a variety of forms of
military stress inoculation,

1846
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,670
most famous of which of
course is the Navy seal buds,

1847
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:26,010
a strep test really,

1848
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,810
which is screening procedure
for becoming a seal

1849
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:29,860
involves a lot of exposure to cold water.

1850
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:35,350
However, if you're interested
in using cold exposure

1851
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:37,730
for fat loss and thermogenesis,

1852
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,620
you want to do the exact opposite thing.

1853
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,950
There was a paper published
in nature two years ago

1854
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:47,430
which showed that cold induced shiver,

1855
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:52,370
the actual physical shiver
activates the release of

1856
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,500
a chemical in the body from
muscle called succinate

1857
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,184
S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E.

1858
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:02,950
Succinate travel in the
bloodstream and then goes

1859
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:05,920
and activates a particular category of fat

1860
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,060
not the typical kind pink or white fat

1861
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,010
that we think of is
like blubber in humans.

1862
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,410
That the stuff that people will seem to

1863
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,733
generally want less of,

1864
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,790
except for those genetic freaks
that seem to have none of it

1865
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:18,120
depending what they consume.

1866
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,203
Congratulations.

1867
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,210
Brown fat is called Brown fat

1868
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:25,548
because it's actually
dark under the microscope.

1869
01:20:25,548 --> 01:20:29,080
It's rich with mitochondria
and it exists mostly

1870
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,120
between the scapulae
and in the upper neck.

1871
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,840
And it generates thermogenesis
and heat in the body.

1872
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,003
It's rich with a certain category
of agile anergic receptor,

1873
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:44,853
in insanely epinephrin binds
to adrenergic receptors.

1874
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:50,310
These Brown fat cells increase metabolism,

1875
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:52,860
it's called Brown fat thermogenesis

1876
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,210
and cause fat burning,
burning of other kinds of fat,

1877
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:57,910
the pink and white fat.

1878
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:58,830
So what does this all mean?

1879
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:01,390
This means if you want to use the ice bath

1880
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,620
in order to increase
metabolism, shiver away.

1881
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,660
If you want to use the
ice bath or cold shower

1882
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,410
in order to stress
inoculate, resist the shiver

1883
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:14,193
and learn to stay calm
or "muscle through it".

1884
01:21:14,193 --> 01:21:15,920
I mean, I don't know that
anyone's ever really talked

1885
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,740
about this publicly because
I think the data are so new.

1886
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,350
And I think that people
assume that the ice bath

1887
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,200
or cold exposure is just one thing.

1888
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,230
Here I've talked about it three ways

1889
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,750
to shift your circadian rhythm
depending on whether or not

1890
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,000
you're doing it early in the day

1891
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,580
while your temperature is
still rising or at its peak

1892
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,840
or after that peak, in order
to extend the perception

1893
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,950
of your day as continuing
and make you want to go

1894
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:44,093
to sleep later and wake up later.

1895
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,250
Now, and then the third
way of course is to either

1896
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:51,080
activate brown fat thermogenesis
and increase metabolism.

1897
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,050
I suppose the fourth way would be to

1898
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,760
increase stress tolerance
or stress threshold, okay?

1899
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,140
But remember, temperature is the effector

1900
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,520
of circadian rhythms.

1901
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,913
Light is the trigger.

1902
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,010
The super charismatic nucleus
is the master circadian clock

1903
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,320
that mediates all these changes,

1904
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,250
also influenced by non-photic influence

1905
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,670
like exercise and feeding
and things of that sort.

1906
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,323
But temperature is the effector.

1907
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:21,750
Now you can also shift your
circadian rhythm with eating.

1908
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,790
When you travel and you
land in a new location

1909
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:27,750
and your schedule is inverted 12 hours.

1910
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,720
One way that we know you
can shift your rhythm

1911
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,890
more quickly is to get onto
the local meal schedule.

1912
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,450
Now that probably has
to do with two effects.

1913
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,200
One or changes in temperature inducer,

1914
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,630
eating induced increases
in body temperature.

1915
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:41,490
Now you should understand
why that would work

1916
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:45,290
as well as eating has this
anticipatory secretion

1917
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:47,860
of beta, of hyper cretin orexin

1918
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,540
that I talked about it earlier.

1919
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,820
So, if this is getting a
little too down in the weeds,

1920
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,450
don't worry about it.

1921
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:55,570
I will get more into this in episode four

1922
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,820
of how to shift one's rhythm.

1923
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,300
But I would love for people
to understand that light

1924
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,420
and temperature are the
real heavy duty leavers

1925
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:03,957
when it comes to moving
your circadian rhythm

1926
01:23:03,957 --> 01:23:06,330
and sleep times and activity schedules

1927
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,690
and exercise and feeding can help,

1928
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,460
but really temperature and light,

1929
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:13,540
with light being the primary
one are the most important

1930
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,440
when it comes to sleep and wakefulness.

1931
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:20,258
Many people asked questions
about food and neurotransmitters

1932
01:23:20,258 --> 01:23:23,700
and how those relate to
sleep, wakefulness and mood,

1933
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:28,700
which is essentially 25 hours
of content for me to cover.

1934
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:32,530
But I'm going to try and distill
out the most common questions.

1935
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,780
We've talked a lot about
neuromodulators like dopamine,

1936
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:37,080
acetylcholine and norepinephrine.

1937
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,640
You may notice in those
discussions that the precursors

1938
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,570
to say serotonin is tryptophan.

1939
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,970
Tryptophan actually comes from the diet.

1940
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:46,770
It comes from the foods that we eat.

1941
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,060
tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.

1942
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,190
It comes from the foods that we eat.

1943
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,430
And then once we ingest them

1944
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,130
those compounds are
circulated to a variety

1945
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:03,437
of different cells and tissues,
but it is true that our food

1946
01:24:03,437 --> 01:24:06,400
and the particular foods we can influence,

1947
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,440
things like neuromodulator
levels to some extent,

1948
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,470
it's not the only way,
because there are also enzymes

1949
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,490
and biochemical pathways
that are going to regulate

1950
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:17,340
how much tyrosine gets
converted into dopamine

1951
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,980
and there are elements of
the dopaminergic neurons,

1952
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:22,150
the dopamine neurons
themselves that are electrical

1953
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:24,100
that have influence on this as well.

1954
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,520
But there are a couple fair
assumptions that we can make.

1955
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,950
First of all, nuts and meats
in particular red meats,

1956
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:36,660
tend to be rich in things
like tyrosine, right?

1957
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,940
That tells you right there,

1958
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,280
that because tyrosine is
the precursor of dopamine,

1959
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,860
and dopamine is the
precursor of norepinephrine,

1960
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:47,670
and epinephrine that those
foods tend to lend themselves

1961
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:50,880
toward the production of dopamine

1962
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,110
and epinephrin and the sorts of things

1963
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:55,730
that are associated with wakefulness.

1964
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:58,260
Now, of course, the
volume of food that we eat

1965
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,630
also impacts our wakefulness.

1966
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,470
If we eat a lot of anything,

1967
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:05,540
whether or not it's ribeye
steaks, rice, or cardboard,

1968
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,810
please don't eat cardboard,

1969
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,470
your stomach if it's
very distended it will

1970
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,660
draw a lot of blood into your
gut and you will divert blood

1971
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,770
from other tissues and
you'll become sleepy.

1972
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,310
So it's not just about food content,

1973
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,700
it's also about food volume, all right?

1974
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,870
Fasting states generally are
associated with more alertness,

1975
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:27,870
epinephrin so forth and fed
states are generally associated

1976
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,670
with more quiescence and
relaxation, serotonin,

1977
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:34,840
and the kind of things that
lend themselves more towards

1978
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,220
sleep and less toward alertness.

1979
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,850
Foods that are rich in
tryptophan tend to be things

1980
01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:43,090
like white meat, turkey,
also complex carbohydrates.

1981
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:46,750
So if you like you can start experimenting

1982
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,670
depending on what foods you eat.

1983
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:53,110
You can start experimenting
with carbohydrate rich meals

1984
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:57,900
for accessing sleep and
more depth of sleep.

1985
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,700
This is actually
something I personally do.

1986
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:02,010
I tend to eat pretty low
carbs during the day.

1987
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,950
I actually fast for until about noon.

1988
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,560
Not because I have to work to do that,

1989
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,220
but because I'd rather just drink caffeine

1990
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:08,860
and water during that time.

1991
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,300
And then sometime around noon

1992
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,360
I can't take it anymore and I'm hungry.

1993
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,750
And I eat and I try and eat low carb-ish

1994
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,540
unless I've worked out extremely hard

1995
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,720
in the previous two
hours, which I rarely do,

1996
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,480
although I do it sometimes.

1997
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,440
And that meal is then
designed to prolong my period

1998
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,160
of wakefulness into the late afternoon.

1999
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,210
And then sometime around dinner time

2000
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:31,860
which for me is around 6:37 PM, 8:00 PM.

2001
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:34,100
Sometimes as late as 9:00
PM, I tend to eat things

2002
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:38,233
like white meat, fish, pastas,
rice, that kind of thing.

2003
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,040
My favorite food of all

2004
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,320
for accessing tryptophan
is actually a starch.

2005
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,611
It's actually a vegetable.

2006
01:26:44,611 --> 01:26:47,690
And it's the croissant, which
is my favorite vegetable.

2007
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:50,480
I don't eat those all
the time, but I love them

2008
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,160
and they seem to increase
dopamine as well.

2009
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,410
I've never actually done
the mass spectrometry

2010
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,820
on a croissant, but they
definitely increase tryptophan

2011
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,723
and relaxation for me.

2012
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:05,570
In all seriousness, low
carbohydrate/fasted/ketogenic diets

2013
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,550
tend to lend themselves toward wakefulness

2014
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:11,930
by way of increasing epinephrin,
norepinephrine, adrenaline

2015
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:13,630
dopamine, and things of that sort.

2016
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:16,610
Carbohydrate rich meals.

2017
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,050
And I suppose we talked about
meals as opposed to diet

2018
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:23,300
tend to lend themselves more
toward tryptophan, serotonin

2019
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,313
and more lethargic states.

2020
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:29,700
There is very limited
evidence that I am aware of

2021
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,360
that carbohydrates should
be eaten at one time a day

2022
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,890
as it relates to metabolism, et cetera.

2023
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:39,170
I'm sure that will open up
a certain amount of debate.

2024
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:40,240
If you work out very hard

2025
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,000
and you deplete glycogen,
then this all changes.

2026
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,330
So some people are working out very hard

2027
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:46,720
in depleting glycogen
and other people are not.

2028
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,850
That gets way outside the context

2029
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:51,960
of this particular podcast,
but yes indeed different foods

2030
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,017
can bias different neuromodulators

2031
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:57,090
and thereby can modulate awaking

2032
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:59,823
or our feelings of
lethargy and sleepiness.

2033
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:06,240
There are a couple effects
of food that are independent

2034
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,860
or I should say a couple
of facts of eating,

2035
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:09,240
'cause the food won't
do it when it's sitting

2036
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:13,580
across the table, but of
eating that are powerful

2037
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,730
for modulating circadian,
rhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.

2038
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,040
And that's because every time we eat

2039
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,630
we get eating induced thermogenesis

2040
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:21,980
regardless of what we eat.

2041
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:24,260
Now that eating induced thermogenesis

2042
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,580
and increase in metabolism,

2043
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,430
which is an increase
in temperature really,

2044
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:33,430
is probably greatest for amino
acid rich foods like meats,

2045
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,280
but also other types of foods.

2046
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,560
It's a minimal increase
in body temperature

2047
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:42,840
compared to say cold exposure or exercise.

2048
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,990
Now, whether or not it's
a quarter of a degree

2049
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:46,100
or half a degree or a degree,

2050
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,030
it really depends on the individual.

2051
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,410
And of course there are
blood sugar effects.

2052
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:53,260
There are things like whether or not

2053
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,490
you are type one or type two diabetic,

2054
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:56,970
whether or not you're insulin resistant,

2055
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:59,860
whether or not like there's a kid who

2056
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:03,170
interns on the podcast
here, who's 17 years old

2057
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:05,770
and I'm convinced that he can eat anything

2058
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,330
and he just seems to like burn it up

2059
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,550
and he's growing it every time.

2060
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:11,380
Actually the other day, he
walked into the other room

2061
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:14,120
and two days later, he
walked out of the same room.

2062
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,360
He came out in between of course,

2063
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,390
but and I was like, you're grow?

2064
01:29:18,248 --> 01:29:20,050
And he was like, you know,
but he's at that stage where

2065
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,890
he's just growing.

2066
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,750
Food is going to affect a
teenager very differently

2067
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,060
than it's going to affect
a full-grown person.

2068
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:31,060
So, in general, starchy
carbohydrates, white meat,

2069
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,940
such as turkey, some fish
increased tryptophan,

2070
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:36,000
therefore serotonin, therefore

2071
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,373
more lethargic states more calm.

2072
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:42,690
Meat, nuts and there are
probably some plant-based foods

2073
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:44,610
that I'm not aware of and I apologize,

2074
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:48,100
I should read up on this that
also are high in tyrosine

2075
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,560
that can increase things like dopamine,

2076
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,870
norepinephrine, epinephrin alertness.

2077
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:56,440
So you can vary these however you like.

2078
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,930
Most people I think are eating
a variety of these things

2079
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:00,380
in a given meals.

2080
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,620
And there are other
parameters of nutrition

2081
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:03,820
that are important too.

2082
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,970
Volume of food for the reasons
that I mentioned before,

2083
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:09,280
the volume of food in the
gut, less food in the gut

2084
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,910
whether or not it's empty
or a small amount of food

2085
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:14,200
which tend to correlate with wakefulness.

2086
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,160
Large volumes of food of any
kind will tend to correlate

2087
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,050
and drive the calming response

2088
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:23,130
and that's by way of this
nerve pathway called the vegas.

2089
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:25,860
We actually have sensory fibers
in the gut that communicate

2090
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,810
to a little protrusion of neurons

2091
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:30,570
that sit right next to the
juggler called the nodose ganglia

2092
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:34,210
N-O-D-O-S-E unlike Costello,

2093
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,691
it's no dose right now he's all dose.

2094
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:39,890
Nodose actually means
having many protrusions

2095
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,410
and it's like kind of a
lumpy collection of neurons.

2096
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:43,730
A ganglia is just a collection of neurons.

2097
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:47,210
And then it goes into the
brain stem and then forward

2098
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:49,310
in the brain to the areas of
the brain they're involved

2099
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:52,633
in production of various neuromodulators.

2100
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:57,210
So what we eat and the volume of food

2101
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:59,260
are both signaling to the brain.

2102
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,200
It's not just one or the other.

2103
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,270
And then there's also this
eating induced thermogenesis.

2104
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:06,200
And now, you know, from the
discussion about temperature

2105
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,070
that if you're eating early in the day

2106
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,070
you're tending to shift
your rhythm earlier.

2107
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:13,460
So that you'll want to wake
up earlier the next day

2108
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,340
if you're eating very late in the day,

2109
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,620
even if you can fall asleep after that,

2110
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:19,530
there's a tendency for
you to want to sleep later

2111
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:20,730
the next day.

2112
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,700
Now this of course is all
going to be constrained by

2113
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:24,740
when your kids need to eat,

2114
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:25,880
and when your spouse needs to eat,

2115
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:26,790
and when your friends need to eat,

2116
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,890
or if you live alone or what
other things you're doing,

2117
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:31,380
if you're like me and you
kind of don't eat until noon

2118
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,650
then eat sometime around noon.

2119
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:33,930
And then I'm terrible about meals.

2120
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,240
I just start eating the ingredients

2121
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,200
while I'm supposed to be cooking

2122
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,640
and then eventually they're all gone

2123
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,163
and I guess that's a meal.

2124
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:41,410
It varies.

2125
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:43,190
Some people are neurotically attached

2126
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:45,310
to a particular meal schedule.

2127
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,143
Some people are not.

2128
01:31:46,143 --> 01:31:49,260
I take my light exposure
schedule far more seriously

2129
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,900
than I take my meal schedule.

2130
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,120
Although in general, try
and eat healthy foods

2131
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,020
for the most part croissants included.

2132
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,937
I was asked several times whether or not

2133
01:31:58,937 --> 01:32:00,740
men and women or males and females

2134
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:03,140
differ in terms of these
neurotransmitter phenotypes

2135
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,873
and the rhythms of sleep and temperature,

2136
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,400
or we could probably devote a whole month

2137
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,110
and we probably will
devote an entire month

2138
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,160
to what are called sex differences

2139
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,990
because those tend to be related to things

2140
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:18,060
we absolutely know like
XX, or XY chromosomes

2141
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:21,080
or XYY in some cases
are double X chromosomes

2142
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,980
as opposed to gender, sex
and karyotype as we call it

2143
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,083
genetic makeup is crystal clear.

2144
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:32,110
There are things that
correlate with one or the other

2145
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,420
but it's complicated

2146
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:36,090
and it's not something
that's been explored in

2147
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:38,220
what I think is enough detail.

2148
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:42,240
Actually recently, I guess
it was about five years ago,

2149
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,925
the national institutes of
health made it a mandate

2150
01:32:44,925 --> 01:32:48,820
that all studies use sex
as a biological variable,

2151
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,410
and actually explore both sexes of mice,

2152
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:53,530
both sexes of humans when
doing any kind of study

2153
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:56,370
because there was a bias
towards only using male animals

2154
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,720
or male subjects prior to that time.

2155
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,260
So a lot of data now coming out

2156
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,650
revealing important sex differences

2157
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:05,190
that I think are going
to have powerful impact

2158
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,810
on health practices, et cetera.

2159
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,740
Response to drugs,

2160
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,800
response to just different
sleep schedules, et cetera.

2161
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,250
Perhaps the most salient and obvious one

2162
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:18,250
is that during pregnancy
females experience a whole range

2163
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:21,060
of endocrine and neuro effects

2164
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,920
and we definitely will
devote a month to pregnancy

2165
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,653
and childbirth and child rearing.

2166
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:29,090
And for that, I'd really like
to bring in some experts.

2167
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:31,180
I've got terrific colleagues
at Stanford and elsewhere

2168
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,140
that work on these things,

2169
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,580
so that we can go into
those in more depth.

2170
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,700
So I'm not blowing off those questions.

2171
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,780
I'm just, I'm kind of
pushing them down the road

2172
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:42,370
a little bit where I can give
you a more thorough answer.

2173
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:45,260
So as we finish up, I
just want to offer you

2174
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:48,080
the opportunity to do an experiment.

2175
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,830
We've talked about a lot of variables

2176
01:33:49,830 --> 01:33:51,970
that can impact sleep and wakefulness.

2177
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:53,830
And in keeping with the
theme of the podcast

2178
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:57,330
we are going to continue to
talk about sleep and wakefulness

2179
01:33:57,330 --> 01:34:00,130
and tools for those, and the
science behind those tools

2180
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:01,610
as we go forward.

2181
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:05,170
But there are really just
four simple parameters

2182
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:07,460
that you have control over,

2183
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,730
that you can immediately start to record

2184
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:14,080
and take note of just
to see how you're doing

2185
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,350
with these things.

2186
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:18,570
With no judgment or perhaps no change

2187
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,150
to what you're actually doing.

2188
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:24,440
It might be interesting, just
a suggestion to write down

2189
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:29,010
for each day when you went
outside to get sunlight

2190
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:31,030
and when you did that, relative to waking.

2191
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,863
So you would write down,

2192
01:34:31,863 --> 01:34:33,840
like the way I do this
in my calendar is I'll

2193
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,190
write down that I don't
get exact about it.

2194
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,570
I might say, I woke up at 6:15 and then I,

2195
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:45,296
as I'll put a W 6:15,
and then SL for sunlight

2196
01:34:45,296 --> 01:34:46,770
and you'll sometimes
get outside right away.

2197
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:47,957
Other times I'm less good at that.

2198
01:34:47,957 --> 01:34:51,050
And I'll go out around, let's say seven

2199
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:55,030
and for how long, I don't maybe
like 10, 15 minutes or so.

2200
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:56,720
And then I'll put a little check

2201
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:59,910
at the times that I
eat my so-called meals.

2202
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:01,700
Although, as I mentioned,
sometimes my meals are

2203
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,690
a bunch of small checks
that just kind of extend

2204
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:05,230
through the late hours of the day.

2205
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:09,870
Yours might be more
confined to certain times.

2206
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:14,190
And then you might just take
note of when you exercised,

2207
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:16,340
just put down an E for when you exercise.

2208
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:19,105
Weight training or aerobic exercise.

2209
01:35:19,105 --> 01:35:23,110
And you might note when you
might've felt chilled or cold

2210
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:25,810
if you do, or you might've
felt particularly hot,

2211
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:26,960
or if you woke up in the middle of night,

2212
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,010
when you felt particularly hot.

2213
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:29,720
And then the last thing
you might want to do

2214
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,030
is just write down

2215
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:33,720
if and when you did a non
sleep deep rest protocol,

2216
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,740
an STR protocol, that could be meditation,

2217
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:38,570
that could be yoga nidra,
that could be hypnosis.

2218
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:42,758
Anything that you're using to deliberately

2219
01:35:42,758 --> 01:35:45,980
teach your nervous system,
how to go from more alertness

2220
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,080
to more calmness in the waking state,

2221
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,410
even if it's waking up in
the middle of the night

2222
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:52,140
and doing an SDR protocol
or in the afternoon,

2223
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:54,650
or first thing in the
morning to recover some sleep

2224
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:57,450
and ability to perform
DPOs that you might've lost

2225
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,550
from a minimal or poor night's sleep.

2226
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:01,660
So you're going to rite
down when you woke up,

2227
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:04,270
when you viewed sunlight,
that might be in the morning

2228
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:06,100
and the evening, or just
the morning, hopefully

2229
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:08,960
it's the morning and the
evening, when you exercised,

2230
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,630
when you eat your meals and using a simple

2231
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:16,300
record keeping scheme like W
for waking, SL for sunlight

2232
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,140
maybe you come up with a
system where it's a check

2233
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,955
or an X or something for exercise.

2234
01:36:19,955 --> 01:36:22,930
This is not designed to make
you neurotically attached

2235
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:27,930
to tracking all your behaviors
and everything you do.

2236
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,070
I for instance, don't track what I eat.

2237
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:32,470
In particular, I kind of
know what works for me

2238
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:35,690
and I'd just try and
stay within that range.

2239
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,120
But by doing this you can start to reveal

2240
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,870
some really interesting patterns.

2241
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:43,270
Patterns that no answer that
I could provide you about

2242
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:48,170
any existing tool or
protocol could counter.

2243
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:51,510
It's really about taking
the patterns of behaviors,

2244
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:53,670
of waking, and light viewing, and eating,

2245
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:58,160
and exercise and superimposing that on

2246
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,993
what you're learning

2247
01:36:58,993 --> 01:37:01,080
in this podcast and elsewhere of course

2248
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,910
and what you already know
and trying to see where

2249
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:07,050
certain problem or problems or
pain points might be arising.

2250
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:08,487
Maybe you're eating really late in the day

2251
01:37:08,487 --> 01:37:09,784
and you're waking up

2252
01:37:09,784 --> 01:37:10,617
in the middle of the night, really warm.

2253
01:37:10,617 --> 01:37:13,240
Well, now you would say,
"Well, that could be due to

2254
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:17,440
kind of an increase in temperature
that is extending my day

2255
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,250
or maybe you start to find
that using cold exposure

2256
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,980
early in the day is great for you,

2257
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:25,020
but using it late, if
it's too late in the day,

2258
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:25,960
that's not great.

2259
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:29,120
Or if you're into the sauna or it's even

2260
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,900
like some people, including
myself, if I take a hot shower

2261
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:34,450
or sit in a hot tub or
a sauna late at night,

2262
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:37,720
well then I get a compensatory
decrease in body temperature

2263
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,320
and I sleep great provided
I hydrate well enough,

2264
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,370
'cause that can be kind of
a dehydrating thing to sit

2265
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:44,320
in hot, hot conditions.

2266
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,690
But if I do the sauna early in the day,

2267
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:49,780
unless I exercise immediately afterward

2268
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,410
then I tend to get the temperature
drop, which makes sense

2269
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:55,340
because when you get in the
sauna, you're get vasodilation.

2270
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,800
You throw off a lot of heat and then you

2271
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,720
generally get a compensatory
drop in temperature.

2272
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:00,550
If you do that early in
the day, that's right

2273
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:02,320
about the time that temperature

2274
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,990
is trying to entrain the
circadian clocks of your body.

2275
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:06,380
That's what happens to me.

2276
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,090
Other people, it might
be slightly different

2277
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:12,470
and some people have more
resilient systems than others.

2278
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:15,810
So I just encourage you to
start becoming scientists

2279
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:19,350
of your own physiology of
your own brain and body

2280
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:21,040
and seeing how the
various tools that you may

2281
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:25,420
or may not be using are
effecting your patterns of sleep,

2282
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,760
your patterns of
attention and wakefulness.

2283
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,410
It's vitally important
that if you do this,

2284
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,880
that you know that it's
not about trying to get

2285
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,810
onto an extremely rigid schedule,

2286
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,360
it's really about trying
to identify variables

2287
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:41,200
that are most powerful
for you, and that push you

2288
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,620
in the direction that you want to go.

2289
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:45,750
And changing the variables
that are pushing your body

2290
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:47,930
and your mind in the directions
that you don't want to go.

2291
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:50,620
Self experimentation is
something that should be done

2292
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:54,050
slowly, carefully, you don't
want to be reckless about this.

2293
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:57,490
And this is where I would
say manipulating one

2294
01:38:57,490 --> 01:38:59,900
or two variables at a time
is really going to be best

2295
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,670
as opposed to changing of
a dozen things all at once

2296
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:05,803
to really identify what it is
that's most powerful for you.

2297
01:39:06,694 --> 01:39:09,548
As always, thank you so
much for your questions.

2298
01:39:09,548 --> 01:39:12,020
We are going to continue
to answer questions.

2299
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,077
I certainly didn't get to all of them

2300
01:39:13,077 --> 01:39:15,470
but we tried to get to
most all of the ones

2301
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:16,903
that were frequently asked.

2302
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:20,650
Episode four of the podcast,
I'm going to get into,

2303
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:24,840
shift work, jet lag and
age dependent changes

2304
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,460
in sleeping and wakefulness and cognition.

2305
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,530
So for those of you with kids,

2306
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:32,090
for those of you that are kids

2307
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:36,470
for those of you with older
relatives or who might be older

2308
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,410
meaning probably when
you start to get into

2309
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:42,250
late '60, '70 and '80 is
when there's some marked

2310
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,740
biological shifts in
temperature regulation

2311
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,340
and things that relate to sleep.

2312
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,270
And for those of you that travel,

2313
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:50,760
we're going to talk about jet lag.

2314
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:53,400
The shift work discussion
might seem only relevant

2315
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,510
to those that work nights, but
actually that's not the case.

2316
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:58,640
Most people because of the
way they're interacting

2317
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:03,080
with devices are actually
in a form of shift work now,

2318
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,327
where the days are
certainly not nine to five,

2319
01:40:05,327 --> 01:40:06,930
the so-called banker's hours,

2320
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,740
and then the lights are out at nine

2321
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,590
and they're asleep until 5:00 AM.

2322
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:12,860
Some people have that
schedule, most people do not.

2323
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:17,680
So episode four, we will go
deeply into shift work, jet lag

2324
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:20,760
age dependent changes in
sleep alertness and cognition

2325
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,890
and I will touch back on
a few of your questions

2326
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:23,723
but don't think that

2327
01:40:23,723 --> 01:40:25,770
if your question wasn't answered
during these office hours

2328
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,883
that we won't get to it, I
absolutely will at some point.

2329
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:32,590
In addition to that, several of you

2330
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:35,560
have graciously asked how you
can help support the podcast.

2331
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,307

2343
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,330
from the information would be terrific.

2344
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:12,050
As always I will be continuing
to post on Instagram.

2345
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:15,350
You can expect another podcast
episode out next Monday

2346
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:17,860
about the topics that we've
been discussing this month

2347
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,070
and above all,
[upbeat music]

2348
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:21,020
thank you for your interest in science.
