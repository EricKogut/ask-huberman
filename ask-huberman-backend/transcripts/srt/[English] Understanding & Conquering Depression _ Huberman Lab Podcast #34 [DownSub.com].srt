00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,350
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,437
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,070
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,130
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,820
This month, we're talking all
about disorders of the mind,

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,300
things like depression,
attention deficit disorders,

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,963
eating disorders, schizophrenia,
and bipolar disorder.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,130
During the course of this month,

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,260
we are going to discuss the psychological

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,360
and biological underpinnings
of mood disorders of all kinds.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,970
You'll learn a lot of science.

14
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,190
You'll also learn a lot
about the various treatments

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,770
that exist and that are in development

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,160
for these various mood disorders.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,210
We will talk about behavioral
tools, things like exercise,

18
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,270
meditation, breath work,
but also prescription drugs,

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,460
supplements and novel compounds
that are now being tested

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,440
in various clinical trials.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,500
Across the month, I think
you'll start to realize

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,850
that there are common pathways

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,420
underlying many mood disorders.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,150
In fact, mood disorders
that look quite different

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,070
from one another often
depend on the action

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,300
of the same neurochemicals
or neural circuits

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,950
in the brain and body.

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,460
That actually should be
a point of great relief

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,210
because what it means is that
by understanding the biology

30
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,510
of one mood disorder or
understanding how one treatment

31
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,840
or behavioral intervention
can impact a mood disorder,

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,840
we gain insight into other
mood disorders as well.

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,690
As always, we will discuss
science and science related tools

34
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,260
that people could implement
should they choose.

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,690
Before we dive into today's topic,

36
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,680
I'd like to discuss a very particular

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,970
set of scientific findings
that relate to today's topic,

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,280
and that are important for
understanding all mood disorders

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,280
and all states of motivation,
happiness, and sadness,

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,300
as well as depression.

41
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,060
Basically, I'm going to
paraphrase a brief segment

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,910
of my discussion with Dr. Anna Lembke,

43
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,650
who I sat down with to discuss addiction

44
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,690
and the biological basis of addiction

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,933
and addiction treatment.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,750
A very important aspect of that discussion

47
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,170
was when Dr. Lembke described
the pleasure pain balance,

48
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,920
literally the circuits in our brains

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,370
that control our sense
of pleasure and pain,

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,350
and ultimately whether
or not we remain happy

51
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,293
in our pursuit of pleasure or not.

52
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,480
This is an absolutely crucial aspect

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
to the way that we
function in everyday life,

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,870
and especially under
conditions of mood disorders.

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,490
The pathway that she was describing

56
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,550
is the so-called pleasure system.

57
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,490
However, what most people don't realize

58
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,990
is that the pleasure system

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,420
is also directly associated with,

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,550
and in fact is the very same system

61
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,150
that modulates mental or
psychological anguish and pain.

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,680
Essentially what she described

63
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,010
is that whenever we pursue something

64
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,550
that we think will bring us pleasure,

65
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,230
and that could be anything that we think

66
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,460
will bring us pleasure from
food, to video games, to sex,

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,293
to a particular job or goal,
short-term or long-term,

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,310
that we experience release of
the neuromodulator dopamine.

69
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,360
Now, dopamine is associated
with increased levels

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,510
of motivation and drive.

71
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,040
It is not the molecule of reward,

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,610
it is the molecule of
craving motivation and drive.

73
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,520
However, as Dr. Lembke pointed out,

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
when we are in pursuit of something,

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
there is a release of
dopamine in our brain

76
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,360
that makes us feel motivated,

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,870
and in general, it makes us feel good.

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,200
But very shortly thereafter

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,050
and beneath our conscious awareness,

80
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,500
there is a tilt of the pleasure
pain balance in the brain,

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,290
literally a shift in the neural circuits

82
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,220
that underlie pleasure and pain,

83
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,370
such that every bit of
pleasure or pleasure seeking

84
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,520
that causes release of dopamine

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,860
will be balanced out by
a little bit of pain.

86
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,360
And we don't experience
this as physical pain,

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,500
at least not at first,

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,090
we experience it as craving for more

89
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,420
of the thing that brought us pleasure.

90
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,780
Now, that sounds pretty good.

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,670
You get pleasure and then
you get a little bit of pain

92
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,860
to balance it out.

93
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,600
It's subconscious and you experience it

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,360
as the desire to seek out more pleasure.

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,600
However, it's actually
more diabolical than that.

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,120
And we really need to keep an eye on this

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,079
if we are to remain happy,

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,659
if we are to remain in
pursuit of our goals.

99
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,690
The crucial thing to
understand is that if we remain

100
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,260
in constant pursuit of pleasure,

101
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,460
the pain side of the balance tips

102
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,980
so that each time we are in pursuit

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,340
of that pleasureful thing,
activity, or substance,

104
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,450
we are going to experience,

105
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,490
we literally achieve less dopamine release

106
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,130
each subsequent time.

107
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,410
So we get less pleasure and the
amount of craving increases.

108
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,050
Now, after a certain point or threshold,

109
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,760
we call that addiction.

110
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,417
And the way to reset the balance,

111
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,600
and this is very important,

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,490
the way to reset the balance

113
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,290
is actually to enter into states

114
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,320
in which we are not in
pursuit of pleasure,

115
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,800
to literally enter states
in which we are bored,

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,830
maybe even a little bored and anxious,

117
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,680
and that resets the pleasure pain balance

118
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,940
so that we can return to
our pursuit of pleasure

119
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,910
in a way that's healthy,
and then in an ongoing way,

120
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,310
won't lead to this over
tipping or this increase

121
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,160
in the amount of pain or addiction.

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,340
So this is very important.

123
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,410
And if this seemed vague,

124
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,200
what this means is we
should always be cautious

125
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,780
of any state of mind
or body or any pursuit

126
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,860
that leads to very large
increases in dopamine.

127
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,240
And if it does, we should be very careful

128
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,020
to not pursue that repeatedly over time.

129
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,100
During today's episode, I'm
going to give an example,

130
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,860
a real life example of a
discussion that I've been in

131
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,560
with a young man who's 21 years old

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,520
who's dealing with a disruption

133
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,363
in this pleasure pain balance.

134
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,240
He is essentially depressed
and he's depressed

135
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,260
because of his ongoing pursuit
of a particular activity

136
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,900
that initially led to a lot of dopamine,

137
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,330
but over time has led to
less and less dopamine

138
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,410
and more and more of this
pain side of the balance.

139
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,170
We could call him addicted
to that particular activity.

140
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,730
Whether or not he's addicted
by clinical standards or not,

141
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,140
really, isn't important.

142
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,540
What is important is that he
experiences this as depression,

143
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,580
as low affect as it's called or anhedonia,

144
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,040
an inability to experience
pleasure from that thing

145
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,500
or from anything else.

146
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,210
And he's currently undergoing treatment

147
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,160
through a rebalancing of
his pleasure pain pathway.

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,010
So while I can't reveal
his identity to you,

149
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,280
that wouldn't be appropriate.

150
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,820
He did give me permission to reveal

151
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,100
the general architecture
of what he's coping with.

152
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,400
And I spent some hours with
him on the phone this week,

153
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,770
talking to him as well
as to the various people

154
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,180
that he's working with
to really understand

155
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,910
what's going on here 'cause
I think it can illustrate

156
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,930
the relationship between
dopamine, pleasure, and pain

157
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,930
for sake of addiction,

158
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,670
but also for understanding how
to avoid depressive states,

159
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,520
how to remove ourselves
from depressive states.

160
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,970
And as you'll see today,
as we discussed depression,

161
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,460
many of the molecules and neural pathways

162
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,490
and biological mechanisms
that we know can be used

163
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,910
to counter depression,

164
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,450
feed back onto this pleasure pain balance.

165
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,820
Before we begin, I'd like
to say that this podcast

166
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,770
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

167
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,910
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

168
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,650
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

169
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,630
and science related tools
to the general public.

170
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,770
In keeping with that theme,

171
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,640
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

172
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,420
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

173
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,860
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

174
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,480
that analyzes data from blood and DNA

175
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,020
to help you better understand your body

176
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,020
and help you reach your health goals.

177
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,840
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

178
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,430
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

179
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,810
that impact our immediate
and long-term health

180
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,010
can only be detected from
a quality blood test.

181
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,150
The problem with most
blood tests, however,

182
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,770
is that you get information
back about hormone levels,

183
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,777
metabolic factors, et cetera,

184
00:07:55,777 --> 00:07:58,520
but you don't really know what
to do with that information.

185
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,240
Some things might be flagged
as too high or too low,

186
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,200
but really interpreting
those data and taking action

187
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,540
to bring those numbers into
the ranges that you want

188
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,610
is what it's really about.

189
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,870
An InsideTracker makes all that very easy.

190
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,140
They have a platform, it's a dashboard

191
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,920
that will tell you for instance,

192
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,360
what sorts of dietary changes
or supplementation changes

193
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,080
or exercise changes will help
you bring various hormones,

194
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,270
metabolic factors, and other
factors into the ranges

195
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,730
that are right for you.

196
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,350
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

197
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,630
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

198
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,659
And if you do that, you'll get 25% off

199
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,349
any of InsideTracker's plans.

200
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,890
Just use the code "huberman" at checkout.

201
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,900
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

202
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,480
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

203
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,910
probiotic drink.

204
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,420
I've been using athletic
greens since way back in 2012.

205
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,010
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

206
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,750
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

207
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,670
and that I still take Athletic Greens

208
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,350
is that it really covers
all of my foundational

209
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,530
nutrient and micronutrient needs.

210
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,170
It has vitamins, minerals,

211
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,870
and the thing that's especially
important to me these days

212
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,640
is the probiotics,

213
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,310
because there are so many data

214
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,680
that show that having a
healthy gut microbiome

215
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,260
is vital to having a healthy immune system

216
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,800
and for healthy gut brain axis,

217
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,640
literally the functioning
of your brain, your mood,

218
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,450
various aspects of brain inflammation

219
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,080
or limiting brain
inflammation are facilitated

220
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,790
by having a healthy gut microbiome.

221
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,170
And that's facilitated by
getting the proper probiotics.

222
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,710
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

223
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,560
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

224
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,030
And if you do that, you can
claim their special offer.

225
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,210
The special offer is
five free travel packs,

226
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,550
which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

227
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,510
while you're on the road or in the car,

228
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,220
and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,700
Vitamin D3K2 have been shown
to have a number of different

230
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,760
positive health effects on hormones,

231
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,660
on cardiovascular health, and so on.

232
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,380
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

233
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,090
to claim their special offer.

234
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,480
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Belcampo.

235
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,170
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

236
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,670
that raises organic,
grass fed, and finished

237
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,660
certified humane meats.

238
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,070
I don't need a lot of meat.

239
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,820
Typically my diet regime
is one in which I fast

240
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,190
until about noon,

241
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,470
and then I have a lunch
which is fairly low carbs.

242
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,690
So I'll have some piece
of meat or chicken or fish

243
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,840
and some salad typically.

244
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,230
And then in the evening is when I tend

245
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,960
to emphasize carbohydrates.

246
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,170
That helps me be really
alert during the day

247
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,340
and sleep well at night.

248
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,650
When I do eat meat, I insist that the meat

249
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,200
be of the very highest quality

250
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,880
and that it is sourced in humane ways.

251
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,060
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

252
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,170
and seasonal grasses,

253
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,340
and that results in meat
that is higher in nutrients

254
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,490
and healthy fats.

255
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,660
There are now a lot of
data pointing to the fact

256
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,670
that high levels of omega-3
fatty acids are vital for mood,

257
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,360
for cardiovascular health
and various aspects

258
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,390
of maintaining what's called
a healthy Inflammatone,

259
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,210
the various things in our brain and body

260
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,720
that maintain a healthy
inflammation response,

261
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,810
but one that doesn't go out
of whack or get unchecked

262
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,330
in any way that is detrimental to us.

263
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,810
If you'd like to try
Belcampo, first-time customers

264
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,400

268
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,070
Today we're discussing depression.

269
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,800
In particular, we're going to
talk about major depression.

270
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,420
The phrase major depression
is used to distinguish

271
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,500
one form of depression from the other,

272
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,803
the other one being bipolar depression.

273
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,310
Bipolar depression, sometimes
called bipolar disorder,

274
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,000
is really characterized by manic highs.

275
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,990
So where people aren't sleeping

276
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,440
and they're talking very fast,

277
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,160
and they're buying things
and pursuing resources

278
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,590
that they can't afford,

279
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,670
they're starting
relationships left and right,

280
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,080
they're manic,

281
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,330
followed by periods of
crashes of feeling very low,

282
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,380
lethargic, and so on.

283
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,550
Bipolar depression is an
absolutely crucial thing

284
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,710
for us to discuss.

285
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,020
And therefore we are
going to have an entire

286
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,930
separate episode related
to bipolar depression.

287
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,880
Today, we're going to talk
about major depression,

288
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
also sometimes called unipolar depression,

289
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,660
just because it doesn't
have the highs and lows.

290
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,003
It's more characterized by the lows.

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,440
We're going to talk about the biology,

292
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,780
the psychology, and
the various treatments,

293
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,660
behavioral, drug,
supplementation, diet, exercise,

294
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,510
all of that.

295
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,390
Before we go forward into the material,

296
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,830
I just want to emphasize
that any discussion

297
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,890
about mood disorders carries with it

298
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,100
a particular sensitivity,

299
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,423
and that sensitivity is one
related to self-diagnosis.

300
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,590
Today's episode, and indeed
in the future episodes

301
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,480
for this month on mood disorders,

302
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,420
you're going to hear various
symptomologies that are used

303
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,223
to diagnose and characterize
these disorders.

304
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,610
If you recognize some of these
symptomologies in yourself

305
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,380
or in others that you know,

306
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,260
that's an important thing to take note of.

307
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,330
However, accurate diagnosis
really should be done

308
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,370
by a qualified healthcare professional.

309
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,430
So at once I'm saying, keep
your eyes and your ears up

310
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,380
for things that sound familiar to you

311
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,500
that might be of concern.

312
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,340
And at the same time,

313
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,630
I'm saying don't necessarily
leap to conclusions.

314
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,140
Take those flags of
concern if they're there

315
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,510
and bring them to a qualified
healthcare professional,

316
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,010
and they'll be able to
properly diagnose you

317
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,770
as having a particular mood
disorder or diagnose somebody

318
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,060
as having a particular
mood disorder or not.

319
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,940
And that's an essential step.

320
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,330
I don't say this to protect us,

321
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,660
I said this really to protect you.

322
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,700
Okay, let's have a fact-based
discussion about depression.

323
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,330
And I promise you that where
we don't know certain things

324
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,730
about depression, I will
be clear to tell you.

325
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,590
In fact, we are going to
talk about some treatments

326
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,090
for depression that are
looking very promising,

327
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,960
and that right now are actually
being used more and more.

328
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,350
And from my read of the
mechanistic literature,

329
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,960
we're still a bit in the
dark as to how these work.

330
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
That's actually a common
theme of medicine.

331
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,570
Many times there are
treatments that seem promising

332
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,650
or that look really terrific.

333
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,540
And there isn't a lot of
understanding about mechanism.

334
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,420
However, any good discussion
about neuroscience

335
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,080
and in particular about mood disorders,

336
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,410
has to get into mechanisms.

337
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,410
So we're going to do that.

338
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,070
And in doing that, we're
going to frame the discussion

339
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,220
for the tools of how to
keep depression at bay

340
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,470
and how to deal with it

341
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,070
if you happen to find yourself depressed,

342
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,030
or if you know somebody
else who's depressed.

343
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,530
What is this thing we call depression?

344
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,480
Was I mentioned before, it has two forms,

345
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,380
bipolar depression, which
we're not talking about today,

346
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,350
and major depression, also
called unipolar depression

347
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,183
is the other.

348
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,720
Major depression impacts
5% of the population.

349
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,190
That is any enormous number.

350
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,830
That means if you're in
a class of 100 people,

351
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,100
five of them are dealing
with major depression

352
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,200
or have at some point.

353
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,670
Look around you in any environment

354
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,580
and you can be sure that a
good portion of the people

355
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,910
that you're surrounded by
is impacted by depression,

356
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,300
or will be at some point.

357
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,160
So this is something we
really have to take seriously

358
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,623
and that we want to understand.

359
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,510
It is the number four cause of disability.

360
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,430
A lot of people miss work, miss school,

361
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,320
and before then likely perform
poorly in work or school

362
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,780
due to major depression.

363
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,690
Now there's a very serious
challenge in having a discussion

364
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,540
about depression and it relates
directly to the challenges

365
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,083
in diagnosing depression.

366
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,890
Earlier, I did an episode
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth,

367
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,500
who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD.

368
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,333
He's a psychiatrist.

369
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,740
And he made a very important point,

370
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,920
which is that the field of
psychiatry and psychology

371
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,370
are confronted with a challenge,

372
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,470
which is they're trying to
understand what's going on

373
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,340
within the stuff that's in our brains

374
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,490
that's deep to our skulls.

375
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,670
We don't have access to
that without brain imaging

376
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,550
and electrodes and things like that.

377
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,700
Someone just comes into the
office and the dissection tool

378
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,550
for depression so to speak is language.

379
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,330
In order to determine if
somebody has depression or not,

380
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,700
we have to use language,
how they talk about things,

381
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,300
also how they carry their body.

382
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,670
Also some general patterns of health.

383
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,880
So let's talk about depression

384
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,550
the way that clinicians
talk about depression,

385
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,610
because one of the issues is that

386
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,210
we use the word depression loosely.

387
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,737
A lot of people say,
"Oh, I'm so depressed.

388
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:24,187
"I didn't get this job
or I'm so depressed.

389
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:25,877
"I just don't know, I
had a really rough week

390
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:27,267
"or I'm exhausted.

391
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,187
"I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed

392
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:30,527
"I thought I was going to go on vacation

393
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:32,680
"and then they canceled the flight." Okay.

394
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,290
That is not clinical depression.

395
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,350
That's called being bummed
out, being sad or disappointed.

396
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,810
Now that person might be depressed,

397
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,070
but clinical depression

398
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,930
actually has some very specific criteria.

399
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,460
And those criteria are
mainly characterized

400
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,200
by the presence of certain things

401
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,620
and the absence of a
few particular things.

402
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,560
So let's talk about the
things that are present

403
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,520
in somebody that has major depression.

404
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,930
First of all, there tends
to be a lot of grief.

405
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,170
There tends to be a lot of sadness.

406
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,609
That's no surprise.

407
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,179
The threshold to cry is often
a signature of depression.

408
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,200
Now that doesn't mean
that if you cry easily,

409
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
that you're depressed.

410
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,150
Some people cry more easily than others,

411
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,609
but if you're somebody who
typically didn't cry easily

412
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,289
and suddenly you find
yourself crying very easily,

413
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,207
that could be a sign of depression.

414
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,823
And I want to emphasize, could.

415
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,429
There's also this thing
that we call anhedonia,

416
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,460
a general lack of ability to enjoy things,

417
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,120
things that typically or
previously we enjoyed.

418
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,040
Things like food, things like
sex, things like exercise,

419
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,070
things like social gatherings,

420
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,190
a kind of lack of enjoyment
from those things.

421
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,360
Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad,

422
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,850
and sometimes it's just flat,
it's just kind of neutral.

423
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,980
It doesn't feel good
because nothing there.

424
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,520
It's like bland food.

425
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,490
It's like these experiences are analogous

426
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,540
to biting into your
favorite article of food

427
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,010
and it just not tasting very good.

428
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,750
It just doesn't taste
like anything at all.

429
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,010
And that's a common symptom
of major depression.

430
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,230
The other one is guilt.

431
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,160
Oftentimes people with
depression will feel very guilty

432
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,830
about things they have done in the past,

433
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,100
or they'll just generally
feel badly about themselves.

434
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,600
And we're going to talk
about this because it relates

435
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,340
to some of the more serious symptomology

436
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,690
seen in depression sometimes,

437
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,140
things like self harm,
mutilation, or even suicide.

438
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,640
But for the time being, we
want to frame up anhedonia,

439
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,860
this lack of ability to
achieve or experience pleasure,

440
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,720
or kind of a flat affect as it's called.

441
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,550
Sometimes even delusional thinking,

442
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,150
negative delusional thinking,

443
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,120
and in particular anti-self confabulation.

444
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,730
What is anti-self confabulation?

445
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,180
Well, first of all, confabulation
is an incredible aspect

446
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,250
of our mind and our nervous system.

447
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,520
You sometimes see other
forms of confabulation

448
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,460
in people who have memory deficits

449
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,270
either because they have brain damage

450
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,240
or they have age-related dementia.

451
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,170
A good example of this would be someone

452
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,960
with age related dementia
sometimes will find themselves

453
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,660
in a location in the house and
not know how they got there.

454
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,350
And if you ask them, "Oh,
what are you doing here?"

455
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,247
They will create these elaborate stories.

456
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:16,827
"Oh, I was thinking about
going to the shopping today,

457
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,017
"and I was going to take the bus,

458
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:19,850
"and then I was going to do this."

459
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,020
They create these elaborate
stories, they confabulate.

460
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,110
And yet that person hasn't
left the house in weeks

461
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,780
and that person doesn't
have a driver's license.

462
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,670
And so they're really
just creating this stuff.

463
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,780
They're not lying to get out of anything,

464
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,710
they're confabulating.

465
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,400
It's as if a brain circuit
that writes stories,

466
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,713
just starts generating content.

467
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,780
In major depression,

468
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,640
there's often a state of
delusional anti-self confabulation,

469
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,940
where the confabulation are not directly

470
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,190
or completely linked to reality,

471
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,870
but they are ones that make the self,

472
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,550
the person describing them,

473
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,950
seem sick or in some way not well.

474
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,250
A good example would be somebody

475
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,820
who experiences a physical injury perhaps.

476
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,930
Maybe they break their
ankle, maybe it's an athlete,

477
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,300
and they also happen to become depressed.

478
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,987
And you'll talk to them and
say, "How are things going?

479
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,233
"How's your rehab though?"

480
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,097
And they go, "Oh, it's
okay. And I don't know.

481
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:13,497
"I feel like I'm getting
weaker and weaker by the day.

482
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:14,607
"I'm just not performing well."

483
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,100
And then you'll talk to the person

484
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,750
that they're working with,

485
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,150
their kinesiologist or whoever
the physical therapist is.

486
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,987
And they'll say, "No, they're
actually really improving.

487
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,057
"And I tell them they're improving,

488
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,757
"but somehow they're not
seeing that improvement,

489
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:28,660
"they're not registering
that improvement."

490
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,500
You notice that sometimes it's subtle

491
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,760
and sometimes it's severe, but
they'll start confabulating.

492
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,367
You'll say, "I actually heard
you're doing much better.

493
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,337
"You're getting better,
you're taking multiple trips

494
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:40,287
"around the building now

495
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,130
"before you could barely get out of bed."

496
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,177
And they'll say,

497
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,537
"Yeah, well basically,
they changed some things

498
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,717
"about the parking lot that
make it easier to move around.

499
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:50,130
"So it's not really me."

500
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,450
And these aren't people that
are just explaining away

501
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,790
their accomplishments

502
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,030
'cause they're trying to brush off praise.

503
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,420
They are viewing themselves

504
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,130
and they're confabulating
according to a view

505
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,800
that is very self-deprecating

506
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,540
to the point where it doesn't
match up with reality.

507
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,950
It's not what other people see

508
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,530
and it's actually not
matched up with reality.

509
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,810
And that's a symptom of depression

510
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,110
that I think we don't often think about

511
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,060
or conceptualize enough.

512
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,477
So it's not just telling people,

513
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,800
"oh yeah, it's not as good as
it seems. Everything's bad."

514
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,230
These people really believe that

515
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,340
and it becomes disconnected from reality.

516
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,410
So it's if they're sort
of sinking into a pit

517
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,010
and they're losing touch with
the realities of the world,

518
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,010
including data about themselves,

519
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,410
their ability to move and get around it,

520
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,960
for example, in that particular instance

521
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,000
that I used as an example,
but there are others as well.

522
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,400
The other common symptomology
of major depression

523
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,750
is what they call
vegetative symptoms, okay?

524
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,300
So vegetative symptoms
are symptoms that occur

525
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,100
without any thinking, without any doing,

526
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,490
or without any confabulation.

527
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,130
These are things that are
related to our core physiology.

528
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,490
The word vegetative,

529
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,120
you might know it sounds like vegetable.

530
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,570
It actually relates to
a system in the body

531
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,200
that nowadays is more commonly called

532
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,530
the autonomic nervous system.

533
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,407
The vegetative nervous system

534
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,360
and the autonomic nervous system,

535
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,060
historically were considered
sort of one in the same.

536
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,860
And it relates to things
like the stress response

537
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,760
or to our ability to sleep.

538
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,330
So vegetative symptoms

539
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,430
be things like constantly being exhausted.

540
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,770
The person just feels exhausted.

541
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,420
It's not because they exercise too much,

542
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,670
it's not necessarily because
of a life event, it could be,

543
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,460
but they're just worn out.

544
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,130
They don't have the energy they once had.

545
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,430
So it's not in their heads, it's probably,

546
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,630
and now I think we have good
data to support the fact

547
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,530
that there's something off,

548
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,570
something is disrupted in the autonomic

549
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,397
or so-called vegetative nervous system.

550
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:49,450
And one of the most common symptoms

551
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,270
of people with major depression,

552
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,540
one of the signs of major
depression is early waking

553
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,610
and not being able to fall back asleep

554
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,870
despite being exhausted.

555
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,250
So waking up at 3:00 AM
or 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM

556
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,260
just spontaneously and not
being able to go back to sleep.

557
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,950
I want to emphasize that that could happen

558
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,000
for other reasons as well,
but it is a common symptom

559
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,570
or warning sign of major depression.

560
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,993
So let's talk more about
sleep and depression.

561
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,500
It's well-known that the
architecture of sleep

562
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,360
is disrupted in depression.

563
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,700
What's the architecture of sleep?

564
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,150
I've done entire episodes about this,

565
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,380
but very briefly in two sentences,

566
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,180
although they're probably
be run on sentences,

567
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,540
early in the night,

568
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,370
you tend to have slow wave
sleep more than REM sleep

569
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,660
or Rapid Eye Movement sleep.

570
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,540
As the night goes on,

571
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,920
you tend to have more
Rapid Eye Movement sleep.

572
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,450
That architecture of slow wave sleep

573
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,880
preceding Rapid Eye Movement sleep

574
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,880
is radically disrupted
in major depression.

575
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,260
In addition, the pattern
of activity in the brain

576
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,230
during particular phases
of sleep is disrupted.

577
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,480
Now this is during sleep.

578
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,790
So this can't be that people

579
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,680
are creating this
situation for themselves.

580
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,160
These are real physiological
signs that something is off

581
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,930
in this so-called autonomic
or vegetative nervous system.

582
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,830
And then there are some
other things that relate

583
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,830
to the autonomic nervous system,

584
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,600
but that we normally think of
as more voluntary in nature.

585
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,210
And these are things
like decreased appetite.

586
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,210
So you can imagine that one
could have decreased appetite

587
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,720
because of the anhedonia,

588
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,700
the lack of pleasure from food, right?

589
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,800
If you don't enjoy food,

590
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,570
then you might be less
motivated to eat it.

591
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,720
That makes sense.

592
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,520
As well because of these disruptions

593
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,290
in the autonomic nervous system,

594
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,570
these vegetative symptoms,
as they're called,

595
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,790
you can imagine that someone
would have decreased appetite

596
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,569
because some of the hormones
associated with appetite,

597
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:43,900
hypocretin orexin and things
of that sort, ghrelin,

598
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,520
that those will be disrupted.

599
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,710
And if those names of
hypocretin orexin and ghrelin

600
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,860
don't make any sense to
you, don't worry about it.

601
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,210
What those are just hormones
that impact when we eat,

602
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,170
when we feel hungry, and
when we crave food more,

603
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,650
as well as when we feel full,

604
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,480
we have enough so-called satiety.

605
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,730
If you want to learn more about those,

606
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,750
we did entire episodes
on eating and metabolism.

607
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,970
So you can see that the
symptomology of major depression

608
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,830
impacts us at multiple levels.

609
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,200
There's the conscious level of
how excited we are generally.

610
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,380
Well, that's reduced.

611
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,620
There's grief, there's
guilt, there's crying,

612
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,690
but then there's also
these vegetative things.

613
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,900
There's disruptions in sleep,

614
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,880
which of course make
everything more challenging

615
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,713
when we're awake.

616
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:27,060
We know that sleep is
so vital for resetting.

617
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,140
You're waking up early, you
can't get back to sleep.

618
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,880
That's going to adjust your affect,

619
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,390
your emotions in negative ways.

620
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,570
We know this.

621
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,960
And appetite is off.

622
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,520
And there are hormones that get disrupted.

623
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,680
So cortisol levels are increased.

624
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,650
In particular, there's a
signature pattern of depression

625
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,090
whereby cortisol, the
stress hormone that normally

626
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,760
is released in a healthy way

627
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,940
only in the early part of the day

628
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,770
is shifted to late in the day.

629
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,550
In fact, a 9:00 PM peak in cortisol

630
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,040
is one of the physiological signatures

631
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,860
of depressive like states.

632
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,490
It's not the only one, but
it is an important one.

633
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,560
So there are a lot of things
going on in major depression.

634
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,040
And by now you're probably thinking,

635
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,230
goodness, this is dreadful.

636
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,550
Like there's all this terrible stuff.

637
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,520
And indeed it is terrible.

638
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,460
It is a terrible thing to find oneself

639
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,700
in a mode where things
feel sad, you feel guilty,

640
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,090
you're exhausted.

641
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,530
And oftentimes there's also an association

642
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,660
with the anxiety system.

643
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,420
So just because people are exhausted

644
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,340
and lethargic and they don't enjoy things,

645
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,360
doesn't necessarily mean that
there's an absence of anxiety.

646
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,690
There can also be a lot of anxiety

647
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,960
about what's going to happen to me.

648
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,160
Am I going to be able to
achieve my goals in life?

649
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,570
Will I ever get out of this state?

650
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,470
And so things really start to layer on.

651
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,620
And if this sounds depressing to you,

652
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,410
it is indeed depressing.

653
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,760
This is really the place that
many people find themselves.

654
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,560
And it's a pit that they just don't know

655
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,980
how to climb out of.

656
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,750
So let's just take a few minutes

657
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,420
and talk about some of
the underlying biology

658
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,320
that creates this cloud
or this constellation

659
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,990
of symptomology.

660
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,430
I think that's really important to do

661
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,220
because if we want to understand
the various treatments,

662
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,710
how they work and why they
work and how to implement them,

663
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,290
we have to understand some
of the underlying biology.

664
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,300
So let's spend a few minutes

665
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,790
talking about the biology of depression,

666
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,520
what's known and what's not known.

667
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,840
Because in doing that,

668
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,910
I think you'll get a much clearer picture

669
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,060
about why certain tools
work to relieve depression

670
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,733
and why others might not.

671
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,090
So one of the most
important early findings

672
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,230
in the search for a
biological basis of depression

673
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,000
was this finding that there are drugs

674
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,883
that relieve some of the
symptoms of depression.

675
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,560
Those drugs generally fall
into three major categories,

676
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,370
but the first set of
ones that were discovered

677
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,830
were the so-called
tricyclic antidepressants,

678
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,830
and the MAO inhibitors, the
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

679
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,080
You don't need to understand
that nomenclature,

680
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,630
but I'm going to give you
a little bit of detail

681
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,530
so that if you want to
understand it, you can.

682
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,800
Most of this work took
place in the late 1950s

683
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,360
and in the 1960s, and
continued well until the 1980s

684
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,920
when new classes of drugs were discovered.

685
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,790
And these tricyclic antidepressants
and the MAO inhibitors

686
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,490
largely worked by increasing
levels of norepinephrine

687
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,140
in the brain, as well as
in the body, in some cases.

688
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,480
And they were discovered

689
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,350
through a kind of odd
set of circumstances.

690
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,860
We don't have time to
go into all the history,

691
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,170
but suffice to say that
they were discovered

692
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,800
because of the exploration for drugs

693
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,370
that alter blood pressure.

694
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,960
Norepinephrine impacts blood pressure,

695
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,230
and drugs that lower blood pressure

696
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,460
reduce levels of norepinephrine.

697
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,320
And that in many cases, was
shown to lead to depression

698
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,370
or depressive like symptoms.

699
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,750
And so these drugs, these tricyclic drugs,

700
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,790
and the MAO inhibitors actually
increase norepinephrine.

701
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,820
And frankly, they do quite a
good job of relieving some,

702
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,420
if not all of the symptoms
of major depression.

703
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,210
However, they carry with
the many side effects.

704
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,580
Some of those side
effects are side effects

705
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,990
related to blood pressure itself,

706
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,640
by increasing noradrenaline,
norepinephrine as it's called,

707
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,740
you raise blood pressure.

708
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,630
That can be dangerous,
that can be uncomfortable.

709
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,030
But they also have a lot
of other side effects.

710
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,710
The reason they have other side effects

711
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,220
is because they impact systems
in the brain and in the body

712
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,070
that impact things like
libido, appetite, digestion,

713
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,903
and others.

714
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:38,320
And we'll talk about each
of those in sequence.

715
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,190
Okay, so the experience
that clinicians had

716
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,190
of observing some relief for depression

717
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,190
with the tricyclic antidepressants
and with MAO inhibitors

718
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,450
was terrific, but there
were all these side effects,

719
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,500
side effects that people
really did not like,

720
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,562
they didn't like these drugs at all.

721
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,170
A lot of people get dry mouth,
I mentioned the low libido,

722
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,050
they'd have sleep issues,
appetite issues, weight gain.

723
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,510
They made some people so uncomfortable

724
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,020
that they preferred not to take them,

725
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,870
even though when they didn't take them,

726
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,760
they had a worsening or a maintenance

727
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,210
of their depressive symptoms.

728
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,900
A decade or so later,
there was the discovery

729
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,540
of the so-called pleasure
pathways in the brain.

730
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,430
These are pathways,
literally groups of neurons

731
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,560
that reside in different
locations in the brain

732
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,630
but connect to one another.

733
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,930
So it's a circuit.

734
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,930
And when you stimulate these
neurons with certain behaviors

735
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,700
or with electrical
stimulation in an experiment,

736
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,533
believe it or not,

737
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,660
that's been done in
both animals and humans,

738
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,720
animals and humans become
very, very motivated

739
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,700
to get more stimulation of these pathways.

740
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,450
So this pleasure pathway or
these circuits for pleasure

741
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,363
are very what we call reinforcing.

742
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,650
In fact, animals and humans will work hard

743
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,060
to get stimulation of these brain areas

744
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,640
even more than they will
work to obtain sex, drugs,

745
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,260
or even if they are addicted
to a particular drug

746
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,900
and they are in a state of withdrawal,

747
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,170
the ultimate state of craving,

748
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,880
if given a choice, a person or an animal

749
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,930
will select to have stimulation
of this pleasure pathway

750
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,110
instead of the drug itself.

751
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,110
And that is a major and
significant finding.

752
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,870
This pleasure pathway,
as it's sometimes called,

753
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,110
involves areas like the nucleus accumbens

754
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,980
and the ventral tegmental area.

755
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,380
These are areas of the brain

756
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,550
that are rich with neurons
that make dopamine.

757
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,940
And if you think to the
symptoms of depression,

758
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,800
of anhedonia, lack of pleasure,

759
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,380
a lack of ability to experience pleasure,

760
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,470
well, that was a smoking gun
that there's something wrong

761
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,330
with the dopamine pathway in depression.

762
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,290
And indeed that's the case.

763
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,670
So it's not just norepinephrine,

764
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,010
it's also the dopamine or pleasure pathway

765
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,690
is somehow disrupted.

766
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,390
And then in the 1980s,

767
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,020
there was the discovery
of the so-called SSRIs

768
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,280
Most people are now
familiar with the SSRIs,

769
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,440
the Selective Serotonin
Re-Uptake Inhibitors.

770
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,020
The SSRIs worked by distinct mechanisms

771
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,090
from the tricyclic antidepressants
and the MAO inhibitors.

772
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,210
As their name suggests, SSRI,

773
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,050
Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors

774
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:16,050
prevent serotonin from being
wiped up from the synapse

775
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,370
after two neurons talk to one another.

776
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,240
What do I mean by that?

777
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,960
Well, here's some very
basic Neurobiology 101.

778
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,610
If you don't know any neurobiology,

779
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,510
you're going to know
some in about 15 seconds.

780
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,580
Neurons communicate with one another

781
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,560
by spitting out chemicals into
the little gap between them.

782
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,740
The little gap between
them is called the synapse

783
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,360
or by the Brits, the synapse.

784
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,900
Those chemicals bind to the
neuron on the opposite side

785
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,020
and cause changes in the
electrical activity of that neuron

786
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,330
on the other side of the synapse.

787
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,070
Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter

788
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,750
or more specifically,
it's a neuromodulator,

789
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,550
can change the activity
of large groups of neurons

790
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,940
in very meaningful ways.

791
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,460
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor

792
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,090
means when a person takes this drug,

793
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,200
some of those drugs include
things like Prozac or Zoloft,

794
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,340
the more typical names
or more generic names

795
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,140
are things like fluoxetine,

796
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,700
when people take those,
more serotonin hangs out

797
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,130
in the synapse and is able to be taken up

798
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,600
by the neuron on the opposite side

799
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,360
because of this selective
re-uptake inhibition.

800
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,740
It prevents the clearance of
serotonin from the synapse

801
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,560
and thereby more serotonin
can have an effect.

802
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,280
So SSRIs don't increase the
total amount of serotonin

803
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,220
in the brain.

804
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,960
They change how effective the serotonin

805
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,060
that's already in the brain is

806
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,900
at changing the activity of neurons, okay?

807
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,810
So they don't increase serotonin,

808
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,610
they increase the efficacy
or the function of serotonin

809
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,590
in the way that I just described.

810
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,040
So that was more than 15 seconds,

811
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,900
but now you understand how SSRIs work.

812
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,220
And I wouldn't be talking about SSRIs

813
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,143
if they didn't in fact work.

814
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,850
Yes, there are many problems with SSRIs.

815
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,960
They do carry certain side
effects in many individuals.

816
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,270
Also, about a third of
people that take SSRIs

817
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,070
don't derive any benefit,

818
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,350
it doesn't relieve their
symptoms of depression.

819
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,110
However, for the other two thirds,

820
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,889
there's often a relief of some,

821
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,519
if not all of the symptoms
of major depression.

822
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,540
The problem is the side effects
that accompany those SSRIs.

823
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,780
And so these days SSRIs
are a complicated topic.

824
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,820
It's sort of what I would
call a barbed wire topic

825
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,909
because we often hear about
all the problems with them,

826
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,329
but these drugs also have
saved a lot of lives.

827
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,320
They've also improved a lot of lives.

828
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,690
The issue is that they tend
to have varying effects

829
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,620
on different individuals,

830
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,860
and sometimes varying effects over time.

831
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,360
So they'll work for awhile then
they won't work for a while.

832
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,387
There are also a lot of
mysteries about the SSRIs,

833
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:53,750
and those mysteries bother people.

834
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,130
What mysteries am I referring to?

835
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,360
Well, SSRIs increase
the amount of serotonin

836
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,120
or more specifically,
they increase the efficacy

837
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,900
of serotonin at the synapse,
that happens immediately,

838
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,010
or very soon after people
start taking SSRIs.

839
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,750
But people generally don't
start experiencing any relief

840
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,330
from their symptoms of depression

841
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,070
if they're going to
experience them at all,

842
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,030
until about two weeks after
they start taking these drugs.

843
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,420
So there's something going
on there that's not clear.

844
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,220
One idea is that the SSRIs
actually can improve symptoms

845
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,370
of depression or even remove
symptoms of depression

846
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,870
through so-called neuro-plasticity

847
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,930
by changing the way that
neural circuits function.

848
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,840
And there are many on this,

849
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,240
but the main categories
of studies on SSRIs

850
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,050
that relate to neuroplasticity
fall into two camps.

851
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,430
One is that the ways in which SSRIs might,

852
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,610
and I want to emphasize,
might be able to trigger

853
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,750
the production of more
neurons in the brain,

854
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,240
in particular areas of the hippocampus

855
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,520
called the dentate gyrus and
others, that impact memory.

856
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,510
This is important. We're
going to come back to memory.

857
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,560
The other is that the
SSRIs have been shown

858
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,860
in various scientific studies to reopen

859
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,520
critical periods of plasticity.

860
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,120
I'll just briefly describe
one of those studies.

861
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,430
There was a study done by
Lamberto Maffei's group in Pisa,

862
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,840
that explored brain plasticity

863
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,000
that's known to be
present in young animals

864
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,470
and disappear in older animals.

865
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,550
And this is also true in
humans that younger humans

866
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,580
have a far more plastic
brain that can change

867
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,210
in many more ways more easily
than can the older brain.

868
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,400
And what they showed was
that fluoxetine, Prozac,

869
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,630
given to adult animals can reopen

870
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,920
this incredible period of plasticity,

871
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,670
can allow more plasticity to occur.

872
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,503
That was interesting.

873
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:44,870
I mean, it's purely through increases

874
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,930
in serotonin transmission.

875
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,600
And there are other studies
showing that fluoxetine

876
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,040
can increase the number of new neurons

877
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,860
that are born into the adult brain,

878
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,360
so called neurogenesis, the
production of new neurons.

879
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,410
So it's very clear that there are at least

880
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,750
three major chemical systems in the brain;

881
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,860
norepinephrine, dopamine,
and serotonin that relate to

882
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,020
and can adjust the symptoms of depression.

883
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,160
And those actually can be
divided into separate categories.

884
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,970
So for instance, epinephrin
or norepinephrine

885
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,370
is thought to relate to the
so-called psychomotor defects,

886
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,410
sometimes called psychomotor retardation.

887
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,080
This is the lethargy,
this is the exhaustion,

888
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,790
this is the inability to get
out of bed in the morning.

889
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,350
Dopamine is thought to
relate to the anhedonia,

890
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,740
or I should say lack of
dopamine in depressive patients

891
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,960
is thought to lead to the anhedonia.

892
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,420
The lack of ability to
experience pleasure.

893
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,420
And serotonin is thought to
relate to the grief, the guilt,

894
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,070
some of the more cognitive
or more emotional aspects

895
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,190
of depression.

896
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,800
So we've got the norepinephrine system

897
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,970
related to activity and alertness,

898
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,460
the dopamine system
relating to motivation,

899
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,610
pleasure, and the ability to
seek and experience pleasure,

900
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,380
and then the serotonin system
that's related to grief.

901
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,870
And unfortunately, brains and organisms

902
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,930
don't work in a simple mathematical way

903
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,890
where you just say, oh, well,

904
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,800
this person's experiencing a lot of grief,

905
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,490
but they don't have any
problems with lethargy.

906
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,340
And so let's just boost
up their serotonin.

907
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
On paper it works,

908
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,630
but oftentimes it doesn't work clinically.

909
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,990
And another patient,
you might get somebody

910
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,570
who can't experience pleasure,
but they're kind of anxious.

911
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,157
They don't have any trouble sleeping,

912
00:38:26,157 --> 00:38:30,210
but they're just much more
anxious and frustrated

913
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,170
than they normally are,

914
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,280
and they meet the symptoms of depression.

915
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,870
Well, you might think, oh, well,

916
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,830
do you just give that person
some drugs increase dopamine

917
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,800
and everything will be better?

918
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,780
And indeed, in some cases that's true.

919
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,150
There are drugs like Wellbutrin,

920
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,690
which function more specifically
on the dopamine system

921
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,500
to increase dopamine and they
also increase norepinephrine.

922
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,580
Many people get great relief
from things like Wellbutrin.

923
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,500
They don't really impact the
serotonin system so much.

924
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,900
And therefore you don't get
a lot of the serotonergic

925
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,960
or serotonin related side effects.

926
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,490
However, some people feel far
too anxious on those drugs,

927
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,450
some people get addicted
to those drugs in a way,

928
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,850
because a lot of those
drugs that increase dopamine

929
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,670
make you want more of those drugs.

930
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,940
So you start to realize that
what makes sense on paper

931
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,350
doesn't always make sense clinically.

932
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,520
And this is why it's complicated.

933
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,100
And a really good psychologist

934
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,870
and a really good psychiatrist
will work with someone

935
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,440
to try and pull and push
on these various systems

936
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,240
to find the combination
of drugs that may be

937
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,123
or may not be correct for them.

938
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,210
There's a fourth aspect of
the chemistry of depression

939
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,550
that's really important to understand.

940
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,530
And that's pain.

941
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,510
We've talked about pain
on this podcast before,

942
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,430
but even if you didn't hear
the episode on pleasure

943
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,120
and pain, just want to
emphasize that pain is something

944
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,260
that we experience in our
body, no surprise there,

945
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,140
an injury, a cut, et cetera,

946
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,320
but that we also
experience emotional pain.

947
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,343
And those systems are linked
in very intricate ways.

948
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,150
There's actually some data
showing that pain relievers,

949
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,920
Tylenol, Aspirin, these sorts of things,

950
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,727
can help certain people
with emotional pain.

951
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:01,400
Now I'm not recommending people run out

952
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,230
and take those things for emotional pain.

953
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,190
But actually, if you think about it,

954
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,670
that shouldn't come as any surprise.

955
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,080
given the enormous number of
people that take painkillers,

956
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,180
opioids and things like
them to try and relieve

957
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,270
their psychological pain.

958
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,430
And as we know, those drugs
are very, very problematic

959
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,130
for many individuals.

960
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,370
They can help certain individuals,

961
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,760
but they are very prone to abuse

962
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,060
and they can induce addiction very easily

963
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,350
in a number of people.

964
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:29,500
There's a substance that's
literally called substance P,

965
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,350
the letter P, that's manufactured
by neurons in our brain

966
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,410
and body, which underlies
our sensation of pain.

967
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,820
And indeed substance P
inhibitors have been used

968
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,410
to treat depression,
and in some cases works.

969
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,060
A lot of people with depression
are hypersensitive to pain,

970
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,910
and of course they could have
multiple things going on.

971
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,900
They could have chronic
pain or chronic injury

972
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,360
and major depression.

973
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,760
So you start to get the constellation

974
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,910
of the many things that could happen.

975
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,530
So that's all I want to say
today about the chemistry

976
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,190
underlying depression or major depression.

977
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,200
There's a lot more there,

978
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,790
but I think if you understand
the norepinephrine system

979
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,610
and that it relates to some
of these things like lethargy,

980
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,430
the psychomotor defects,
as they're called,

981
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,010
dopamine and how it relates to motivation

982
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,010
and lack of motivation and lack
of dopamine and depression,

983
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,340
and serotonin and its
relationship to grief,

984
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,520
and that low serotonin can
lead to extreme grief and shame

985
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,020
and higher serotonin levels
can sometimes restore

986
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,930
a sense of wellbeing and safety

987
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,710
and feeling good about oneself.

988
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,710
If you understand that and you
understand that physical pain

989
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,450
is somehow involved in certain cases,

990
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,107
I think you will know
more about depression

991
00:41:37,107 --> 00:41:39,860
and its underlying chemistry
than most all people out there.

992
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
And if you'd like to learn more,

993
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,200
I invite you to pursue
searching those terms

994
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,400
further on the internet.

995
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,120
And we'll certainly go
into them in more depth.

996
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,170
But that really sets the stage
for where we're headed next.

997
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,820
So next I'd like to talk about hormones

998
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,970
and how they relate to depression.

999
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,770
And I'd also like to talk about stress

1000
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,440
and how it relates to depression,

1001
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,500
as well as talk about some of the genetics

1002
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,780
or the predispositions to depression.

1003
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,970
And for those of you that are thinking,

1004
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:04,890
hey, I want the tools.

1005
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,110
I want to know how to fix depression.

1006
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,770
I understand the desire for that.

1007
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,800
I will just ask if you
hang in here with me

1008
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,070
a little bit longer, not only
will you learn a lot more

1009
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,030
about how this complicated
mood disorder works,

1010
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,280
some of the more
interesting things about it,

1011
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,470
but it will also position
you to get a lot more

1012
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,530
out of the tools that we will describe.

1013
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,450
You always have the option
to skip forward of course,

1014
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,330
but I think it's important to understand

1015
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,960
some of the hormonal and stress-related

1016
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,580
aspects of depression.

1017
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,113
So let's talk about hormones.

1018
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,230
20% of people that have major depression

1019
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,370
have low thyroid hormone.

1020
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,663
Thyroid hormone is related to metabolism.

1021
00:42:41,663 --> 00:42:44,500
Oftentimes we think about
thyroid is only related

1022
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,290
to having a fast metabolism,

1023
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,370
but thyroid is related to
all forms of metabolism,

1024
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,840
including our ability to
synthesize new tissues

1025
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,470
like protein and repair injuries.

1026
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,500
I did a whole episode on
thyroid and growth hormone.

1027
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,530
If you want to check that out,

1028
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,360
all of that is archived
at hubermanlab.com.

1029
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,740
It's all timestamped, et cetera.

1030
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,370
You can find on YouTube, Apple,
Spotify, all those places.

1031
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,930
So if you're curious about thyroid hormone

1032
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,700
and growth hormone, and you want
to do the deep dive on those,

1033
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,040
and you want to learn
how to alter their levels

1034
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,680
using various approaches, check that out.

1035
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,380
But 20% of people with major
depression are hypo thyroidal.

1036
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,290
They don't make enough thyroid.

1037
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,280
And that leads to low energy,

1038
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,350
low metabolism in the brain and body.

1039
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,100
And there's a condition
called Hashimoto's,

1040
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,560
which is essentially low thyroid output.

1041
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,340
And again, I don't want
to get into all the tools

1042
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,173
related to thyroid.

1043
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:40,010
Sometimes a psychiatrists will
prescribe thyroid medication

1044
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,530
to increase thyroid output
in people that are depressed

1045
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,560
and that will work to
relieve the symptoms.

1046
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,940
So there isn't necessarily
a direct problem

1047
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,060
with serotonin, dopamine,
and norepinephrine

1048
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,893
or substance abuse.

1049
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,670
Sometimes it's a thyroid problem.

1050
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,180
So there are certain
situations or conditions

1051
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,170
that can impact the thyroid hormone system

1052
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,700
and make people more
susceptible to depression

1053
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,040
or make a pre-existing depression worse.

1054
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,400
And those are things like childbirth.

1055
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,810
So it's well-known that
women who give birth

1056
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,460
can often undergo what's
called postpartum depression.

1057
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,810
It actually comes from the word
post parturition depression.

1058
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,202
They give birth,

1059
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,980
what's happier, what's
more joyful than the birth

1060
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,370
of a new healthy child,

1061
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,940
and they will lapse into a depression.

1062
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,400
And that's thought to
be hormonally related,

1063
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,990
either directly to the thyroid system

1064
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,800
or perhaps to the cortisol system as well.

1065
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,490
We'll talk about cortisol in a moment.

1066
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,990
As well, certain women
during certain phases

1067
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,980
of their menstrual cycle
experience symptoms

1068
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,800
that are very much like
clinical depression,

1069
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,790
and oftentimes are diagnosed

1070
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:42,140
with clinical depression appropriately.

1071
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,750
And of course the menstrual
cycle is associated

1072
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,080
with shifts in hormone levels.

1073
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,670
As well, menopausal and
post-menopausal women

1074
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,520
are more susceptible to major depression,

1075
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,810
regardless of whether or not they've had

1076
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,430
that major depression
earlier in their life.

1077
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,220
So these are things to
be on the lookout for

1078
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,210
and to definitely talk to a
doctor and get a blood panel

1079
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,750
that hopefully includes
measures of thyroid hormone

1080
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,710
and cortisol hormone.

1081
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,840
Why cortisol hormone?

1082
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,270
Well more stress is
correlated with more bouts

1083
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,840
of major depression across the lifespan.

1084
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,720
How many bouts?

1085
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,530
Well, it turns out that as you go

1086
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,340
from having one to two to three,

1087
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,650
well, when you hit four to five bouts

1088
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,750
of really intense,
stressful episodes in life,

1089
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,310
these tend to be long-term
stressful episodes,

1090
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,340
your risk for major
depression goes way up.

1091
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,880
So whether or not you have
a genetic predisposition

1092
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,080
to depression or not,

1093
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,020
one of the best things you can do

1094
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,540
to try and avoid getting depressed

1095
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,520
is to learn to control your stress system,

1096
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,910
to not go from short-term stress,

1097
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,190
which everybody experiences,

1098
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,280
we all have short-term stressors,

1099
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,440
to medium term stress to long-term stress,

1100
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,820
and to not have too many
bouts of long-term stress

1101
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,210
because that probability
of getting depressed

1102
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,430
goes way, way up.

1103
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,400
And this is something I've
seen over and over again,

1104
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,930
not just in my scientific
career, but just throughout life.

1105
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,560
People in all sorts of
domains, young and old,

1106
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,470
I've seen that people will go through

1107
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,510
a very intense relationship, a breakup,

1108
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,510
sometimes it's the staying
together that stressful,

1109
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,920
sometimes it's a graduate
school that can be stressful,

1110
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,900
sometimes it's some other event.

1111
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,600
And then some months later
they become depressed.

1112
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,260
And that's because the stress system

1113
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,290
is associated with the
release of cortisol.

1114
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,507
The cortisol system
can dramatically impact

1115
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:23,930
the way that these
different neuromodulators,

1116
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,270
dopamine, norepinephrine
and serotonin function.

1117
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,470
And so there's this kind of
latent or longer lasting impact

1118
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,000
on the systems that
impact mood and wellbeing.

1119
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,440
So learning how to control
your stress is really key.

1120
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,960
If you're not depressed or you're somebody

1121
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,050
that has not lapsed into
a depression recently,

1122
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,710
take control of your stress system.

1123
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,600
And we did an entire episode
on how to conquer stress,

1124
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,920
and that involves dealing
with stress in the short term,

1125
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,480
the medium term, and in the long-term.

1126
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,650
And there are a lot of
different ways to do that.

1127
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,640
One of the more important reasons

1128
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,190
for learning how to counter stress

1129
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,030
in order to offset depression

1130
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,970
is that there is a genetic predisposition

1131
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,570
that certain people carry
to become depressed.

1132
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,180
There are these studies now

1133
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,290
of many, many thousands of individuals,

1134
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,910
these were mainly done in New Zealand,

1135
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,190
but these studies have
now been done elsewhere,

1136
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:15,510
looking at many tens of
thousands of individuals

1137
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,730
who carry particular copies of genes,

1138
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,600
what they call polymorphisms,

1139
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,840
in particular of a gene called 5HTTLPR,

1140
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,370
which is a serotonin transporter.

1141
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,910
So this is a gene that
controls or regulates

1142
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,670
how much serotonin is
available in the brain.

1143
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,120
If you have this gene, this polymorphism,

1144
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,490
it doesn't necessarily mean
that you will be depressed,

1145
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:43,340
but it greatly shifts your
susceptibility to depression

1146
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,230
under conditions of stress.

1147
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,027
So I realize some people
are listening to this

1148
00:47:47,027 --> 00:47:48,700
and some people are
watching it on YouTube.

1149
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,890
So I'm going to describe this in a way

1150
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,010
that doesn't require
looking at any graphs.

1151
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,770
What I want you to imagine
is a very, shallow hill,

1152
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,140
like a very mellow hill.

1153
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,720
It's just a ramp set at
about 10 or 15 degrees, okay.

1154
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,680
What we're plotting there in your mind

1155
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,680
is that with each about of serious stress,

1156
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,570
so that could be trying to finish a degree

1157
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,020
or a relationship breakup, or
a family member that's sick,

1158
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,770
or the loss of a loved one or a pet,

1159
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,810
with each about of stress, the probability

1160
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,100
that you will experience a
major depression goes up.

1161
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,100
However, if you carry this
gene, this HTTLPR gene,

1162
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,410
the steepness of that
curve goes way, way up

1163
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,080
where it's actually more like a line

1164
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,520
such that you need far
fewer bouts of stress

1165
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,420
in order to lapse into a
major depression, okay?

1166
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,050
So if the typical person who
doesn't carry this polymorphism

1167
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,870
has to experience two or
three or four or five bouts

1168
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,970
of stress before they
lapse into a depression,

1169
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,480
somebody with this gene is
susceptible to getting depression

1170
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,240
after just one about or two
bouts of intense stress, okay?

1171
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,200
So that's how these genes work.

1172
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,840
They don't preordain or
determine you to be depressed.

1173
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,470
They raise a susceptibility.

1174
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,070
And many genes,

1175
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,630
many things related to
heritability in general,

1176
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,140
work in that way.

1177
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,360
And we know there's a
strong genetic component

1178
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,193
to depression.

1179
00:49:16,193 --> 00:49:17,026
How do we know?

1180
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:21,100
Well, in what are called
concordant monozygotic twins.

1181
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,630
So these will be identical twins.

1182
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,810
And they can either be
in one biological sack

1183
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,100
or two biological sacks while in utero,

1184
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,840
what's called monochorionic
or dichorionic.

1185
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,650
Well, typically it's monochorionic.

1186
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,590
And identical twins, for
which one of those twins

1187
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,070
goes on to have major depression,

1188
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,470
there's a 50% probability
that the other one

1189
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,630
will have major depression.

1190
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,180
So it's not 100%, it's not 100% inherited,

1191
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,910
it's not 100% generic, as you might say,

1192
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,700
but there's a much higher
predisposition for depression.

1193
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,550
Whereas in fraternal
twins, that number drops,

1194
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,660
and in siblings, that
number drops to about 25%,

1195
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,410
and in half siblings, it's about 10%.

1196
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,150
The numbers vary from study to study,

1197
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,260
but basically the more
closely related you are

1198
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,080
to somebody who has major
depression, the more likely it is

1199
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,550
that you will also get major depression.

1200
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,140
And therefore, if you haven't
gotten major depression,

1201
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,640
the more likely it is
that you should take steps

1202
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,690
to learn to mitigate stress

1203
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,170
because stress is the major factor

1204
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:27,360
that can trigger one of
these depressive episodes.

1205
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,360
So we've covered a lot
related to the stress

1206
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,880
and the hormones and the
neurochemistry of depression.

1207
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,180
In fact, I think this is probably
the deepest I've ever gone

1208
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,990
into the biology of any
topic on this podcast

1209
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,730
before getting to any specific tools.

1210
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,670
I mentioned that learning
how to mitigate stress

1211
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,503
and deal with stress,

1212
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:49,250
learning how to measure and
adjust your thyroid hormone,

1213
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,500
those might be useful.

1214
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,830
But next I'd like to turn
to some very specific tools

1215
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,150
that people who both have depression

1216
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,610
or who are prone to depression,

1217
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,070
as well as people who
don't have depression

1218
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,580
and simply want to maintain a good mood,

1219
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,360
who want to maintain a positive affect

1220
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,930
and pursuit of things in life,

1221
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,370
what are the things that you can do?

1222
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,007
It turns out there are
things that you can do

1223
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:11,930
and all of the biology that underlies

1224
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,210
the utility of those things.

1225
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,460
Meaning the reasons those things work

1226
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,100
will now make sense to you
because they adjust things

1227
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,670
like serotonin and dopamine,

1228
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,270
and they adjust them through
very specific pathways.

1229
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,900
I know for many people
learning about mechanism

1230
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,810
is kind of grueling.

1231
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,880
I realized this podcast
isn't necessarily one

1232
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,330
that you can listen to passively
while doing other things.

1233
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,800
Although I would hope
that you could do that

1234
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,270
and still enjoy it and
extract the information.

1235
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,210
Why mechanism?

1236
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,980
Mechanism is so key

1237
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,950
because mechanism is a
little bit like understanding

1238
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,600
some of the chemistry of cooking.

1239
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,870
If you read a recipe and
you can follow a recipe,

1240
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,480
you often hear people say,
oh, I can follow a recipe.

1241
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,470
That means that if you have
every ingredient in that recipe,

1242
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,303
you're good.

1243
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:59,750
You likely can make that
dish. You can make that meal.

1244
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,360
However, if you understand a
little bit of the chemistry

1245
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,860
of why salt has to be
added third and not first,

1246
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,850
or why the heat has to be
adjusted at a particular time,

1247
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,180
well then not only can
you follow a recipe,

1248
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,710
but that also gives you flexibility

1249
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,600
for when salt isn't available,

1250
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,400
or when you want to adjust
the flavor of the dish,

1251
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,500
or when you want to try a new dish,

1252
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,690
or you want to get experimental.

1253
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,140
So when you understand mechanism,

1254
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,830
it puts you in a tremendous place of power

1255
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,540
to work with your system.

1256
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,910
So it's not just plug and chug,

1257
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,710
like take 12 milligrams of this,

1258
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,310
you either feel better or you don't.

1259
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,100
You can really start to
understand how prescription drugs,

1260
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,530
supplements, nutrition, behavioral tools,

1261
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,830
how those things weave
together to either work for you

1262
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,370
or not work for you and get you to paths

1263
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,220
of healthy mind and body.

1264
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,020
So let's think about
why any tool would work

1265
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,560
to relieve depression.

1266
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,940
We've talked about how some of the drugs

1267
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,300
that impact these different
chemical systems might work

1268
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,260
and why they create some of
the problems they create.

1269
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,940
Problems are mainly created
by the fact that they impact

1270
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,550
lots of systems in the brain and body.

1271
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,880
So you take a drug to increase serotonin,

1272
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,270
but that serotonin is also
related, not just to mood,

1273
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,510
but to things related
to libido and appetite.

1274
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,063
And so you start disrupting
multiple systems.

1275
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,000
The same could be said for
behavioral tools, right?

1276
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,220
That any behavioral tool
that adjusts the levels

1277
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,530
of a particular chemical ought to perhaps,

1278
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,310
provide some relief for
some of the symptoms

1279
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:28,750
of major depression.

1280
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,620
Let's take an example that
I've talked about before

1281
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,690
on the podcast, which is,

1282
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,670
if you get into a very cold
shower, you take an ice bath,

1283
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,120
you will release
norepinephrine and epinephrine

1284
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,953
in your brain and body.

1285
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:40,950
There's no question about that.

1286
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,070
I don't think anyone
can really escape that.

1287
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,720
It's a kind of a universal
response to being in cold water.

1288
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,730
Well, if some aspects of depression

1289
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,370
are related to low
levels of norepinephrine,

1290
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:55,700
will taking cold showers
relieve your depression?

1291
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,010
Perhaps it might even
relieve certain aspects

1292
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,960
of that depression.

1293
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,860
Is it a cure? Well, that's going
to depend on the individual.

1294
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,020
Will exercise help?

1295
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,720
Well, if you go out for a run,

1296
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,950
you're going to increase
the amount of norepinephrine

1297
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,110
in your body.

1298
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,410
If you enjoy that run, it's
likely that you'll increase

1299
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,160
the levels of dopamine
and probably serotonin

1300
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,880
in your brain and body as well.

1301
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,030
Will that cure your depression?

1302
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,220
Well, there are a lot of studies exploring

1303
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,060
how exercise can impact depression.

1304
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,980
And indeed, regular
exercise is known to be

1305
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,033
a protective behavior against depression,

1306
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,510
but it also can help relieve

1307
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,520
some of the symptoms of depression.

1308
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,450
So you may ask yourself, why
would you need drugs at all?

1309
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,550
Why would there be prescription drugs

1310
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,610
or the need for
supplementation or other things

1311
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,650
to alleviate the symptoms of depression?

1312
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,930
Ah, well, that's the diabolical
nature of depression,

1313
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,910
which is if people are far
enough along in this thing,

1314
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,530
this sometimes called disease,
sometimes called disorder,

1315
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,530
but major depression, oftentimes
they can't get the energy

1316
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,850
to even get up and take
a bath or a shower.

1317
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:03,140
They have no motivation to do it,

1318
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,200
they have no desire to go for a run.

1319
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,847
So you say, "Come on, let's
go, you'll feel better.

1320
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:08,887
"I know you feel better, it
generates all these chemicals

1321
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:11,967
"I heard on the whatever
podcast, Huberman Lab podcast,

1322
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:14,197
"or another podcast
that getting into action

1323
00:55:14,197 --> 00:55:15,420
"does all these things."

1324
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,690
And they just don't want to do it.

1325
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,210
And to you, a person who's
not experiencing depression,

1326
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,070
that perhaps could just seem
like the most frustrating

1327
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,700
and confusing thing in the world.

1328
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,170
But it's very important to highlight

1329
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,900
the fact that these circuits

1330
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,090
that are accessible to some of us,

1331
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,720
the circuits for happiness,
for pursuit of pleasure,

1332
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,410
for exercise, for
getting in a cold shower,

1333
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,620
if that's your thing,

1334
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,990
that those circuits are
present in all people,

1335
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,570
but for certain people

1336
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,486
that are experiencing major depression

1337
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:47,010
and are really in the
depths of their depression,

1338
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,650
they can't really access
those circuits in the same way

1339
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:54,210
that people who are not
suffering from depression can.

1340
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,230
So I hope that makes it clear.

1341
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:57,400
It's not offering any excuses for them.

1342
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,470
And indeed, I think those
behaviors would help

1343
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,420
jolt them out of some of the
symptomology of depression,

1344
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,250
but they're just not
accessible to everybody.

1345
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,750
So let's talk about the
things that people can do

1346
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,220
to deal with depression.

1347
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,100
And again, anytime you add a behavior

1348
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,990
or a tool or a supplement,

1349
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,960
or subtract a behavior, tool,
supplement, drug, et cetera,

1350
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,720
you absolutely should
talk to your physician,

1351
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,140
especially if you're somebody

1352
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,220
that's dealing with major depression.

1353
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,890
I want to focus on the stress system.

1354
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,860
And I'm not just going to tell you

1355
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,210
to get sunlight in your eyes

1356
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,440
and to get a good night's sleep,

1357
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,980
although I think everybody should do that

1358
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,680
on a regular basis, ideally every day,

1359
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,000
talked about those ad
nauseum on this podcast.

1360
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,200
They will help your sleep,

1361
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,710
they will help you alleviate stress.

1362
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,360
I think you should have
tools to deal with stress

1363
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,140
in real time, et cetera.

1364
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,380
But let's look at depression
from the standpoint

1365
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,480
of a deeper biological phenomenon,

1366
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,540
which is inflammation
and the immune system.

1367
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,410
There's growing evidence now

1368
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,500
that many forms of major depression,

1369
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,500
if not all of them, relate
to excessive inflammation.

1370
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,130
Now inflammation plays an
important role in wound healing.

1371
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,620
It is a positive aspect
of our immune system.

1372
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:12,620
Our ability to combat wounds,
combat illnesses, et cetera,

1373
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,680
but inflammation gone unchecked,

1374
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,240
inflammation that lasts too long,

1375
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,170
or is of too high amplitude,

1376
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,450
meaning too many anti-inflammatory

1377
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,100
or inflammatory cytokines
and things of that sort

1378
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,970
in the body is bad.

1379
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:29,580
And there's decent evidence
now that inflammation

1380
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,380
can lead to or exacerbate depression.

1381
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,420
And that if we want to control depression,

1382
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,780
or limit or eliminate depression,

1383
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,230
that focusing on reducing inflammation

1384
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,880
and its associated pathways
is a really good thing to do.

1385
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,980
And I think this is a really
good thing for everybody to do

1386
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,220
regardless of whether or not
you suffer from depression

1387
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,053
or not.

1388
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:52,180
And today we're going to talk
about exactly how depression

1389
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,610
comes about through the
inflammation pathway.

1390
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,380
So, first of all, who
are the major players

1391
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,670
in creating chronic inflammation
in the brain and body?

1392
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:05,030
They are the inflammatory cytokines.

1393
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,470
Things like IL-6, interleukin-6,

1394
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:11,720
things like Tumor
Necrosis Alpha, TNF alpha,

1395
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,380
things like C reactive protein, alright?

1396
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,687
Not all of these are cytokines.

1397
00:58:16,687 --> 00:58:19,280
You have interferons and prostoglandins

1398
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,640
and a lot of these things.

1399
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,640
But when we are stressed,
chronically stressed,

1400
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,470
we get inflamed, our brain
and various locations

1401
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,780
of the brain become inflamed
because certain classes

1402
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,420
of cells, in particular,
those glial cells,

1403
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,180
the cells that are typically thought

1404
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,630
to just be support cells,

1405
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,510
those cells and their biochemistry

1406
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,020
and their dialogue with the neurons

1407
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,623
of the brain and body
starts to become disrupted.

1408
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,140
I may have mentioned it
earlier, I don't recall.

1409
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,570
But I certainly mentioned
it in an earlier podcast

1410
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,270
that adrenaline epinephrin,
when it's released in the body,

1411
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,910
it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier,

1412
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,510
but there are certain things

1413
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,270
that are able to cross
the blood-brain barrier

1414
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,103
when we are stressed.

1415
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:59,020
Things like the E2 prostoglandins,

1416
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,140
those cross the blood brain barrier.

1417
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,560
And our blood and our brain,

1418
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,200
therefore our brain and
our body can communicate

1419
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,430
because certain things can
pass through this barrier

1420
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,280
we call the BBB or the
Blood Brain Barrier.

1421
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,440
And also we have something
called the glymphatic system,

1422
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,740
which is really a plumbing system

1423
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,880
that links the brain and body.

1424
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,570
It's the link between the
immune system and the brain.

1425
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:23,990
Well, there is a set of
actions that we can take

1426
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,450
in order to limit inflammation.

1427
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:27,640
And this has been shown

1428
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,480
in several quality peer
reviewed studies now

1429
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,650
to reduce inflammation
and to relieve some,

1430
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,750
and in some cases, all of the
symptoms of major depression.

1431
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:41,680
One of those approaches
is to increase our intake

1432
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,483
of so-called EPAs or
Essential Fatty Acids.

1433
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,240
There's now a very long list of papers

1434
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,760
in quality peer review journals

1435
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,690
showing that when people ingest

1436
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,690
a certain level of EPA
omega-3 fatty acids,

1437
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,820
the relief from depressive
symptoms matches the SSRIs.

1438
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,930
That's incredible, right?

1439
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,410
That essential fatty acids

1440
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:08,860
could relieve symptoms of depression,

1441
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,820
as well as some of the
prescription antidepressants.

1442
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,910
Now, this doesn't
necessarily mean you run off

1443
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,700
and stop taking your antidepressants

1444
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,420
if you've been prescribed
them, please don't do that.

1445
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,700
Please talk to your physician.

1446
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:22,530
And I should mention that
some of the same studies

1447
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,600
have shown that increasing our intake

1448
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,010
of these essential fatty acids,

1449
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:30,870
in particular, the EPA
variety of omega-3s,

1450
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:35,720
can lower the effective
dose of things like SSRIs.

1451
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,300
Meaning if we required a 50
milligram or 40 milligram dose

1452
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,870
of fluoxetine, that one
can get by on a lower dose

1453
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:46,390
and thereby perhaps not experience as many

1454
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,930
or as severe side effects

1455
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,293
by taking or supplementing with EPAs.

1456
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:55,010
Now, the threshold level
seems to be about one gram,

1457
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,180
1000 milligrams of EPA.

1458
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,360
So you will sometimes see
on a bottle of krill oil

1459
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,010
or fish oil or any other
source, even plant source

1460
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,870
or other source of EPA
that it's 1000 milligrams

1461
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,400
or 1200 milligrams.

1462
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,170
But what's really important to look at

1463
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:16,830
is whether or not there's more
than 1000 milligrams of EPA,

1464
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,340
because the EPA in particular
is what's important here.

1465
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,310
And actually in exploring
some of the literature

1466
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:26,150
on the effects of EPAs on
cardiovascular health, excuse me,

1467
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,740
as well as their effects on depression,

1468
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,020
there's some interesting
dose dependent responses,

1469
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,040
such that people who took
anywhere from 400 milligrams

1470
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,270
to 5,000 milligrams of EPAs,

1471
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,560
achieved a variety of different benefits.

1472
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,300
And in some cases, some side effects,

1473
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,450
we'll talk about those.

1474
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,330
And it does seem that this 1000 milligrams

1475
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,490
is the critical threshold for benefiting

1476
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,760
or getting some relief
from depressive symptoms.

1477
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,400
But people who took two
grams seem to do better.

1478
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,720
And in the cardiovascular health realm,

1479
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,720
there it's a little more complicated.

1480
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,100
Some studies point to
a very positive effect

1481
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,240
on cardiovascular health

1482
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,193
by taking increasing amounts
of EPA, others, not so much.

1483
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:11,300
The current data point to the fact

1484
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,920
that for every gram of
EPA that one ingest,

1485
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,250
there's about a 9% improvement
in cardiovascular health,

1486
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:21,776
the same dose dependent
improvement on psychological health

1487
01:02:21,776 --> 01:02:25,630
in combating depression
can't really be stated.

1488
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:28,250
I wouldn't say that the more EPA you take,

1489
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,260
the better you're going
to feel so to speak.

1490
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,780
I don't think the data point to that.

1491
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,580
However, it does seem
that if you take a gram,

1492
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,470
1000 milligrams or 2000 milligrams of EPA,

1493
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:40,870
there does seem to be
some substantial relief

1494
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,540
for many people, should
emphasize many, not all,

1495
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,840
for many people in major
depressive symptoms.

1496
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,280
So how would this work?

1497
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,063
Well, turns out that these
inflammatory cytokines,

1498
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,640
they impact neurons and
the circuits of the brain

1499
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,390
that relate to things like serotonin,

1500
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,600
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

1501
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,430
These inflammatory cytokines

1502
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,410
act in a variety of different ways,

1503
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,350
but they mainly act to inhibit
the release of serotonin,

1504
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:12,040
norepinephrine, and dopamine,
or the synthesis of serotonin,

1505
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,380
norepinephrine and dopamine.

1506
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,180
And I'll give you one example of how EPAs

1507
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,100
can positively impact this process.

1508
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,900
And then it points to a second tool,

1509
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,780
which is the proper
utilization of exercise

1510
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:26,950
to offset the effects of depression.

1511
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,450
So now you should understand
why having healthy levels

1512
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,820
of serotonin is important
for maintaining healthy mood.

1513
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,890
It's not responsible for all the aspects

1514
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,183
of having a healthy mood,

1515
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,610
there's also dopamine and norepinephrine,

1516
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,840
but it is a very important one.

1517
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,033
Dopamine also called 5HT,

1518
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,600
essentially derives from a
precursor called tryptophan.

1519
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,470
Tryptophan arrives into our
system through our diet,

1520
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,840
okay, tryptophan is an amino acid.

1521
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,670
Tryptophan is found in Turkey,
it's found in carbohydrates.

1522
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,070
And that should therefore raise the idea,

1523
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,120
hmm, I wonder if one of
the reasons why people

1524
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,770
who are depressed have such an appetite

1525
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,400
for carbohydrate late in foods

1526
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,250
is because they're trying
to get more tryptophan,

1527
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,000
and therefore more serotonin.

1528
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,563
And indeed that's the case.

1529
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,860
Tryptophan is eventually
converted into serotonin.

1530
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,423
However, if there's excessive
amounts of inflammation,

1531
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,747
these inflammatory
cytokines cause tryptophan

1532
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:31,670
to not be converted so
much into serotonin,

1533
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,223
but to be diverted down
a different pathway.

1534
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,790
The pathway involves something
called IDO, Indoleamine,

1535
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:41,803
which converts tryptophan into kynurenine.

1536
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:46,040
Kynurenine actually acts as a neurotoxin

1537
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,713
by way of converting into
something called quinolinic acid.

1538
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,540
And quinolinic acid is pro depressive.

1539
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,960
So if that seems like a
complicated biochemical pathway,

1540
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,260
what's basically happening
here is that the tryptophan

1541
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,563
that normally would be
made into serotonin,

1542
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,740
under conditions of
inflammation is being diverted

1543
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,290
into a neurotoxic pathway.

1544
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,070
And ingestion of EPAs,

1545
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,180
because it limits these
inflammatory cytokines,

1546
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,883
things like IL-6, C-reactive
protein, et cetera,

1547
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,940
can cause more of the
tryptophan that one ingests

1548
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,960
or has in their body to be diverted

1549
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,833
towards the serotoninergic pathway.

1550
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:30,030
Exercise, it turns out,
also has a positive effect

1551
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:34,080
on the tryptophan to
serotonin conversion pathway.

1552
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,930
And the way it does it
is really interesting.

1553
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,570
You now know that tryptophan
can either be converted

1554
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,330
into serotonin or it can be
converted into this neurotoxin,

1555
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,483
which is a bad thing.

1556
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,310
Exercise, the activation of the muscles

1557
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,920
through rhythmic repeated use,

1558
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,060
in particular aerobic exercise,
but also resistance training

1559
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,500
has been shown to do this to some extent,

1560
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:58,360
tends to sequester or shuttle
the contouring into the muscle

1561
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,350
so that it isn't converted
into this neurotoxin

1562
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:03,930
that is pro depression, okay?

1563
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,160
There are a lot of steps in the pathway

1564
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,670
leading to depression,

1565
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,150
but what this essentially means

1566
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:12,410
is that hitting a certain
threshold level of EPA intake,

1567
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,530
whether by supplementation
with fish oil or krill oil

1568
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:16,940
or through some plant source

1569
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,760
if you're not into
ingesting fish or krill,

1570
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,890
or trying to get up above
that 1000 milligram threshold

1571
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,970
for EPA by ingesting
particular food sources,

1572
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:27,080
you certainly can do it through food,

1573
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,580
you don't have to supplement,

1574
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,530
but it's easier to do with supplements,

1575
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,660
that doing that will
limit the inflammation

1576
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,800
that diverts tryptophan into
this neurotoxic pathway.

1577
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,800
And exercise as well, augments
this conversion of tryptophan

1578
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:45,930
into serotonin because it takes this thing

1579
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:49,920
that would potentially be a
neurotoxin and it sequesters it,

1580
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,260
it pulls it away so that it can't actually

1581
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,570
go have its pro depressive effects.

1582
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,040
So you've got multiple steps here.

1583
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,230
We're describing two tools,

1584
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,560
increasing EPA and regular exercise

1585
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,000
as a way of increasing serotonin,

1586
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,630
somewhat indirectly, right?

1587
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:07,510
It's by limiting this bad pathway

1588
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,250
to promote the activity of a good pathway.

1589
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:12,530
But from the data that are published

1590
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,860
in Quality Peer Review journals,

1591
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,760
it really appears that
this inflammation pathway

1592
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,280
does function to increase
depression through these pathways.

1593
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,410
And so knowing that there
are behavioral steps

1594
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,010
and supplementation based steps,

1595
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:26,990
or if you prefer getting
your EPAs from typical food,

1596
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:29,620
from nutritional approaches,

1597
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:32,620
I find that very reassuring
that the mechanisms

1598
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,400
all converge on a common
pathway, serotonin.

1599
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,930
That gives me great peace of
mind that when people say,

1600
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,880
hey, go out for a run,

1601
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,630
or you should get outdoors exercise,

1602
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:45,570
or you should take fish oil
like the Scandinavians do,

1603
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:49,880
I have Scandinavian family
members and they are known to,

1604
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,320
or I should say they are
quite open about the fact

1605
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,110
that during the winter
months in particular

1606
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,960
when depression is more likely,

1607
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,450
but throughout the year, really,

1608
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:01,980
they make an effort to regularly
ingest high levels of EPA,

1609
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,220
either through ingesting
fatty fish and its skin,

1610
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,690
I'm not a particular fan of ingesting

1611
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:08,580
the skin of fatty fish,

1612
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,790
or by supplementing with Cod liver oil

1613
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,500
or other types of fish oil, sardines,

1614
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,590
and things of that sort, sardine oils.

1615
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,840
There are a number of
different things out there

1616
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,270
that one could use.

1617
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,609
So I find it very reassuring

1618
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,709
that there's a common biochemical pathway

1619
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,859
that can explain why these
things not just work,

1620
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:26,549
but why they should work.

1621
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,090
They should work because they operate

1622
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:30,569
in the very same biochemical pathways

1623
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:34,729
that antidepressants that
are prescribed to people do.

1624
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:35,799
So what does this mean for you?

1625
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,740
Well, if you're somebody who
suffers from major depression,

1626
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,080
again, don't stop taking
your prescribed medication.

1627
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,912
Talk to your doctor,

1628
01:08:41,912 --> 01:08:46,912
but talk to them perhaps
about the EPAs and exercise

1629
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,410
and how these things can impinge

1630
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,189
on the same biochemical pathways.

1631
01:08:50,189 --> 01:08:51,419
If you're somebody who is not suffering

1632
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,710
from major depression, I
still think these pathways

1633
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,550
are really important to understand.

1634
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:59,899
And actually knowing these
pathways is additional motivation

1635
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:01,149
to get regular exercise.

1636
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:02,589
I think we all know that
we should be getting

1637
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:05,859
anywhere from 150 minutes
to 180 minutes per week

1638
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:08,869
of so-called zone two cardio
for cardiovascular effects.

1639
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,760
Zone two is the kind of melowish cardio

1640
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,410
where you can sort of hold a
conversation if you needed to.

1641
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,350
But it's a little bit tough,

1642
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,590
you're kind of sucking
for air a little bit.

1643
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:20,130
And that's going to limit
these depressive like symptoms,

1644
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:20,990
I think in all of us.

1645
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,930
I don't think that we
should think of depression

1646
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,770
as a strict threshold.

1647
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,250
I'm somebody who personally
has made the choice

1648
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,770
to take 1000 milligrams of EPA per day.

1649
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,069
I do that by supplementing fish oil.

1650
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:35,149
There's debate out there
as to whether or not

1651
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:39,899
it's better to take EPA
NDHA in particular ratios,

1652
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:43,359
and whether or not DHA can impact the LDL,

1653
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,299
which is the so-called bad cholesterol.

1654
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,010
That's getting really down into the weeds.

1655
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:49,200
And we can talk about
that in a future episode.

1656
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,439
But for myself, I notice
a pretty substantial

1657
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,400
positive effect of taking anywhere

1658
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,490
from 1000 milligrams to 2000
milligrams of EPA per day.

1659
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,780
I do that through supplementation

1660
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,120
and I do strive to try and eat some fish,

1661
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,720
even though frankly, I've
never liked the taste of fish.

1662
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,770
For those of you that would
like a little more detail

1663
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:10,380
or perhaps a lot more detail
into the effects of EPA

1664
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,270
on depression and in
relieving depressive symptoms,

1665
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:17,150
and if you want to get into
the nitty gritty of it,

1666
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:20,800
I invite you to go to examine.com,
put in depression, EPA,

1667
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,900
they list off and have links to 28 studies

1668
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,130
on the effects of EPA on major depression.

1669
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,140
If you go to pub med,

1670
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,240
there are many, many studies on this now

1671
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,993
that date back several decades, really.

1672
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,310
If you're interested in the
specific effects of EPA,

1673
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,170
as opposed to DHA,

1674
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:44,460
I want to point you towards
a particular study entitled,

1675
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,290
not surprisingly EPA, but not
DHA appears to be responsible

1676
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:51,050
for the efficacy of omega-3
long chain polyunsaturated

1677
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,230
fatty acids supplementation
and depression,

1678
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:56,010
evidence from a meta analysis
of randomized control trials.

1679
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:58,130
This is a really wonderful paper.

1680
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:02,270
The author is Julian
Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N-S.

1681
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,800
It was published in 2009.

1682
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,150
We will provide a link to
this study in the caption.

1683
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,430
And that study is really
the one that at least to me,

1684
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:15,130
points to why EPA in
particular is what's effective,

1685
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:19,300
and that whether or not
DHA is problematic or not

1686
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,220
as a separate issue,
but it's really the EPA

1687
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,200
that one wants to hit a
certain threshold level of

1688
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,210
if one's goal is to get
relief from depression

1689
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:31,630
or to keep depression at bay
by keeping mood elevated,

1690
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,030
which is why I take a high-dose EPA.

1691
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,270
So we've got EPA, we got exercise,

1692
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:41,460
now you understand how
they work to adjust mood.

1693
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,670
Now, I want to talk about
something that at least for me,

1694
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,440
was quite surprising when
I first learned about it

1695
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,440
for sake of treatment of mood disorders,

1696
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,180
and that's creatine.

1697
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,930
Creatine has a number of
very important functions

1698
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,260
throughout the body.

1699
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:59,660
For those of you that are
into resistance training,

1700
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,720
and actually for those of you

1701
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,840
that are into endurance training as well,

1702
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,420
creatine has achieved a lot
of popularity in recent years

1703
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,240
because supplementation with
creatine can draw more water

1704
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,410
into muscles and can increase
power output from muscles.

1705
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:18,340
So it's something that does indeed work.

1706
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,520
There have been debates
about whether or not

1707
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,020
it's unhealthy for the kidneys
to take long-term creatine,

1708
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,540
supplementation at high doses.

1709
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,800
And I invite you to go
down that rabbit hole.

1710
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,340
I think most people now accept the idea

1711
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,780
that for most people, not
all, but for most people,

1712
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,750
low dose creatine
supplementation of anywhere

1713
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,690
from one gram to five grams per day

1714
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,420
can have a number of positive effects

1715
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,400
on physical performance.

1716
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,040
People with kidney issues, et cetera,

1717
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,310
need to be especially cautious,

1718
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:47,010
but creatine is interesting
for that purpose.

1719
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,580
However, there's also a
so-called phosphocreatine system

1720
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,870
in the brain, and that
phosphocreatine system

1721
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,167
has everything to do with
the dialogue between neurons

1722
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:58,730
and these other cell types called, glial,

1723
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,670
and glial comprise several cell types,

1724
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:04,320
microglia, astrocytes, et cetera,

1725
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,690
but the foster creatine system

1726
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,210
in the forebrain in particular,
in the front of our brain,

1727
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:13,560
has been shown to be involved
in regulation of mood

1728
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,010
and some of the reward pathways
as well as in depression.

1729
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:22,310
And there are now several
studies, at least three,

1730
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:26,010
although they're probably more
by the time this comes out

1731
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,000
because they're coming
out very quickly now,

1732
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,590
at least three quality
studies pointing to the fact

1733
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,040
that creatine supplementation

1734
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,350
doesn't just have these positive effects

1735
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,330
on physical performance,

1736
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:41,020
but can also be used as
a way to increase mood

1737
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,123
and to improve the symptoms
of major depression.

1738
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:49,160
This has been now done
in several double blind

1739
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,573
placebo controlled studies.

1740
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,060
The studies have looked at women,

1741
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,530
have it looked at men,
have looked at adolescents,

1742
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:01,470
some of whom were taking
SSRIs, some of whom were not,

1743
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:05,900
they've done magnetic
resonance spectroscopy.

1744
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,860
So spectroscopy is a way that you can look

1745
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,230
at the concentrations of
particular in the brain

1746
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,010
in real time in humans,

1747
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:15,930
it can be used for other
things as well, of course.

1748
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:19,780
And basically what's been
observed is that increasing

1749
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,770
the activity of the phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain

1750
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:25,280
can be beneficial or
at least is correlated

1751
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,190
with improvements in mood.

1752
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,780
So let's just talk for a
moment about what's involved

1753
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,430
with using or supplementing creatine

1754
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:36,053
in order to improve mood and
perhaps even treat depression.

1755
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,180
First of all, when I talk about creatine,

1756
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,340
I'm talking about creatine monohydrate,

1757
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:44,350
there are a number of
different forms of creatine.

1758
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,310
Here I'm talking about
creatine monohydrate.

1759
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,760
The American Journal
of Psychiatry in 2012,

1760
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,300
published a study, which was a randomized,

1761
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,810
double blind placebo controlled trial

1762
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,460
of oral creatine monohydrate.

1763
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,470
And what it found is that it could augment

1764
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,970
or enhance the response
to a selective serotonin

1765
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,570
re-uptake inhibitor,

1766
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:06,320
in particular, in women with
major depressive disorder.

1767
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,970
So like EPA, creatine supplementation

1768
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:13,780
seems to either lower the required dose

1769
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,580
of SSRI that's required
to treat depression,

1770
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:21,580
or can improve the effectiveness
of a given dose of SSRI.

1771
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:25,270
However, there are other studies
that have looked directly

1772
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,970
at creating supplementation
in the absence of SSRIs.

1773
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,390
And those are interesting as well.

1774
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:32,800
There's a wonderful and
very comprehensive review

1775
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,810
on creatine for the
treatment of major depression

1776
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,147
that includes beautiful
tables of all the subjects

1777
01:15:39,147 --> 01:15:40,600
and the dosages, et cetera.

1778
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,510
I'm not going to read off every line

1779
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:46,200
and every column in that review,

1780
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,700
but we will provide a link
to that review as well.

1781
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,010
One of the things that's really striking

1782
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,870
about the lists of
studies that they include

1783
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,130
is that most of them used dosages

1784
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,010
that are pretty reasonable
for most people,

1785
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:04,810
anywhere from three grams to five grams,

1786
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:09,003
sometimes up to as many 10
grams per day of creatine.

1787
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:12,560
Many of these also were shown to increase

1788
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,060
activity of this phosphocreatine
system in the forebrain,

1789
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,640
and some show a relationship

1790
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,290
between that phosphocreatine system

1791
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:24,530
and a particular category
of receptors in the brain

1792
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:28,803
called the NMDA receptor,
N-methyl D-aspartate receptor.

1793
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:35,120
The NMDA receptor is
one of the first things

1794
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,040
that every budding
neuroscientists learns about

1795
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,210
because it is the receptor
that has particular electrical

1796
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:46,660
and chemical properties
that make it a critical gate

1797
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,000
for so-called neuroplasticity.

1798
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,483
So it's not a receptor that's
activated in the brain,

1799
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,380
typically for just the
functioning of the brain

1800
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,710
on a day-to-day basis.

1801
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,290
It's a receptor that's activated

1802
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,950
when circuits are going to change,

1803
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,830
when they are inspired to change

1804
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:07,480
by some very strong stimulus,
meaning some experience,

1805
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,460
or in some cases a drug, or
in some cases something else.

1806
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,810
But the NMDA receptor
is a kind of a key node

1807
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,380
for shifting brain circuitry.

1808
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:20,140
And so while the details
aren't entirely clear,

1809
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,210
it seems that creatine supplementation

1810
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:26,320
leads to increases in the
phosphocreatine system

1811
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,710
in the forebrain.

1812
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,783
And that increases in the
activity of the forebrain

1813
01:17:31,783 --> 01:17:34,350
phosphocreatine system relate to changes

1814
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,980
in the way the NMDA receptors function

1815
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:38,910
and may lead to some of the plasticity,

1816
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,540
the changes in neural
circuits that underlie

1817
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,980
the shift from negative mood
and affect to positive mood.

1818
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:46,430
Now, there are a lot of gaps.

1819
01:17:47,326 --> 01:17:49,720
There are a lot of little
boxes or bins in the diagram

1820
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,920
I just laid out for you.

1821
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,690
And some of them are still
truly black boxes, as we say,

1822
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,730
meaning, we don't really
know what's in them yet.

1823
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:57,430
And more mechanistic data are coming.

1824
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,630
However, when you look over
the data in this review,

1825
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,153
or when I look over the
data in this review,

1826
01:18:02,153 --> 01:18:04,110
what you find is that
they're pretty striking

1827
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:07,450
positive effects of creatine.

1828
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:10,230
And one of the more interesting effects

1829
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:12,990
is that creatine has actually been shown

1830
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:17,990
to increase mania in people
that are already manic.

1831
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,770
And that's interesting,

1832
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:22,050
we're not talking about
bipolar depression today,

1833
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:25,530
but it seems that creatine
elevates levels of activation

1834
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:26,660
and kind of mood overall.

1835
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,190
And you could see why
that would be a problem

1836
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:29,990
for somebody that's
already in a manic phase,

1837
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,560
but it actually might be
beneficial for somebody

1838
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,250
who is very low affect
and has major depression.

1839
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,220
So should you supplement with creatine?

1840
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:42,590
Well, as always, talk to
your healthcare provider,

1841
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:45,810
but if you're somebody who
is thinking about things

1842
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:48,040
that you can do and
things that you can take

1843
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,720
in order to improve your
mood, keep depression at bay,

1844
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:55,720
maybe even support other
treatments for major depression.

1845
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,720
the creatine system
seems like a logical one.

1846
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,690
There's at least strong studies
and a good number of them

1847
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:04,800
to look to, to determine whether or not

1848
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,280
that's right for you.

1849
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,550
I personally take five grams
of creatine for other reasons.

1850
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:15,550
I take it for the physical
performance, enhancing effects,

1851
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,740
but it's kind of nice
to think that perhaps

1852
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:19,830
it's also helping me improve my mood.

1853
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,170
That's a choice that I've made for me

1854
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:24,160
is in within the margins of
safety for me in my life.

1855
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,070
I don't know that it's
right for everybody,

1856
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,900
but I find it very interesting.

1857
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,940
And again, I find it
particularly interesting

1858
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:32,840
because there's a logical
biochemical pathway

1859
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,240
to support the finding
that it improves mood

1860
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:37,670
and can offset the effects
of major depression

1861
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:40,150
in some cases, or can improve the effects

1862
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:44,050
of antidepressant
medication in many cases.

1863
01:19:44,050 --> 01:19:47,300
When I see mechanism
and I see effectiveness,

1864
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,630
and the mechanism and
the effectiveness map

1865
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,240
to a lot of the same mechanisms

1866
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,770
that are involved in prescription drugs,

1867
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,240
that gives me great reassurance
that this isn't just

1868
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,310
some sort of mysterious
pathway or mysterious compound

1869
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:01,610
by which a creatine might be working.

1870
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:05,040
So now we've kind of
clustered together EPAs,

1871
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,910
exercise, and their
relationship to inflammation,

1872
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,400
creatine and its relationship
to forebrain function,

1873
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,960
and the phosphocreatine
system, and this NMDA receptor.

1874
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,130
And as you'll see in a few minutes,

1875
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,580
that NMDA receptor turns
out to be vitally important

1876
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,650
and is actually one of
the main nodes of action

1877
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:26,180
for some of the more novel
and exciting therapeutics

1878
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:29,850
that are being explored
now in psychiatric clinics.

1879
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:33,230
So let's talk a little bit
more about this NMDA receptor

1880
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:36,750
and how it relates to some
of the more experimental

1881
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,170
or novel therapeutic
compounds for the treatment

1882
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,230
of major depression.

1883
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:43,660
And the compounds that we're
going to be talking about,

1884
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:47,020
you may have heard of
before, one is ketamine,

1885
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:50,670
which is getting increasing
interest in psychiatric clinics

1886
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:53,520
and in various experimental
and clinical studies,

1887
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,870
and the other is PCP.

1888
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:59,980
Both ketamine and PCP
are known drugs of abuse.

1889
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,580
For many years, people
have abused these drugs,

1890
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,480
go by the street name,
special K, et cetera.

1891
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,890
And they create dissociative
anesthetic states.

1892
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:12,110
So dissociative states
where people don't feel

1893
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:16,663
as closely meshed with their
emotions and their perceptions.

1894
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,820
It's an odd state, I hear.

1895
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,090
And it's an odd state that clinicians

1896
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,400
are now leveraging for the
treatment of depression.

1897
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,720
And we'll talk about why that is,

1898
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,610
but let's talk a little bit
about this NMDA receptor

1899
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:33,340
and why ketamine and PCP
might work for the treatment

1900
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,883
of depression or how they even could work.

1901
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:40,190
I want to be very direct
that this is an area

1902
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:42,990
that still needs a lot of data.

1903
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:44,940
There are however, some excellent papers

1904
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,170
from really terrific groups.

1905
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:50,060
One of them is a paper that
was published in nature

1906
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,150
last year, 2020.

1907
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:55,887
First author is Vesuna,
Sam Vesuna, V-E-S-U-N-A,

1908
01:21:55,887 --> 01:21:57,810
and the last author and
the lead on the study,

1909
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,850
who was Dr. Karl Deisseroth,

1910
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,820
who was a guest on the
Huberman Lab podcast

1911
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:05,680
a few months ago.

1912
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,230
He's world expert in
neuroscience, he's a psychiatrist.

1913
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:14,210
And this paper from Sam
Vesuna and Karl and colleagues

1914
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:17,140
explored how these
dissociative states come about.

1915
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,440
And they looked at this both
in animals and in humans

1916
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,870
and found that there was a,

1917
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,830
essentially a common mechanism

1918
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:27,400
whereby a particular layer of cortex,

1919
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,520
so your brain has this
outer shell of tissue

1920
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,210
that is called the neocortex.

1921
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,390
It's where our perceptions lie,

1922
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,210
it's where our associations lie,

1923
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:39,790
it's a very important area for processing

1924
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:41,823
decision-making and planning, et cetera.

1925
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,027
It's literally stacks of cells,

1926
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:48,960
and one of those layers in the
stack of cells is layer five.

1927
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,980
And the layer five neurons in particular,

1928
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:54,090
went into a particular rhythm
of electrical activity,

1929
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:59,090
this one to three Hertz
rhythm after mice or humans

1930
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:03,423
were administered ketamine or PCP.

1931
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:07,090
There was activation of a
particular area of the brain,

1932
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:10,590
this retro splenium cortex as it's called.

1933
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:14,180
And the dissociative state that emerged

1934
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,900
was an interesting one.

1935
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:19,190
And clinically what's
described in the trials

1936
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:21,530
for ketamine and things like it,

1937
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,453
that people who are
depressed will take ketamine,

1938
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,130
will experience a kind of separateness

1939
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:31,080
from their grief and from their emotions.

1940
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,700
And that possibly there's plasticity,

1941
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,690
there actually shifts
in the neural circuitry,

1942
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:39,630
such that their emotions don't
weigh on them so heavily,

1943
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41,810
I'm using very loose language here,

1944
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:45,680
but that they don't feel as over written

1945
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,360
or as burdened by their own emotions

1946
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,760
as they did previously
to the ketamine therapy.

1947
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,150
Now, absolutely in no way, shape or form

1948
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:55,170
am I suggesting that people
run out and take ketamine

1949
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:56,990
in order to treat their own depression.

1950
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,540
These drugs are still
very much experimental,

1951
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:04,020
although they are approved
in certain contexts,

1952
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,770
at least in the U S,

1953
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:08,170
by prescription for the
treatment of depression.

1954
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:13,410
What's interesting to me is
that these dissociative states

1955
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:18,300
sound at least at the outset
to be more of a separateness

1956
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,160
from everything.

1957
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,400
It sounds a little bit
like depression itself.

1958
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,800
That's sort of like
anhedonia and an inability

1959
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,350
to experience pleasure.

1960
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:30,550
And then one takes a
dissociative anesthetic

1961
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,980
and somehow is able to get relief

1962
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:36,040
by getting even further
away from an experience.

1963
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,650
To me, that doesn't make sense,

1964
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:40,547
but that just speaks to
the fact that these drugs

1965
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:43,670
and these receptors and these pathways

1966
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:46,720
operate through very cryptic means.

1967
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,100
And we really don't understand
all the pathways in the brain

1968
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,780
that relate to motivation
and mood and so forth.

1969
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,540
And the results with these ketamine trials

1970
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,640
are looking very promising.

1971
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,020
In fact, there are a number of trials

1972
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:01,280
that show that a fair number
of people that take ketamine

1973
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,330
in a therapeutic setting
legally with a psychiatrist

1974
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:05,970
guiding the experience

1975
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:08,560
are able to get relief from their symptoms

1976
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,113
without the need for many,
many treatments with the drug.

1977
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:14,690
Just how many treatments varies

1978
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:15,940
from individual to individual,

1979
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:18,470
but it's not like people have
to take this stuff ongoing.

1980
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:22,420
This is really an attempt to
tap into this NMDA receptor

1981
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:25,780
that is related to neuroplasticity.

1982
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:30,600
Both ketamine and PCP
essentially act as antagonists,

1983
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,700
which means they block the NMDA receptor.

1984
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,730
They do it through different methods,

1985
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:38,850
non-competitive and competitive for you

1986
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,367
chemists and pharmacologists out there.

1987
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:42,330
You can look it up if you like.

1988
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:45,170
But what's therefore even more surprising

1989
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:48,450
is that every neuroscientist
learns that activation

1990
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:50,410
of the NMDA receptor,

1991
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:53,690
not antagonism or blocking
of the NMDA receptor

1992
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,490
leads to changes in neural
circuitry in very profound ways.

1993
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,940
In fact experimentally,

1994
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,230
and I've done these experiments myself,

1995
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,440
if you want to prevent plasticity,

1996
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,710
you want to prevent an experience

1997
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:05,220
from reshaping neural circuitry,

1998
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:08,070
you give an MDA receptor blocker.

1999
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:09,250
I've done that many times

2000
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,800
in the course of my experimental
neuroscience career,

2001
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,920
not to myself, obviously,

2002
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,973
but in the course of doing experiments.

2003
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:21,330
So it's still a bit mysterious
to me how this could work.

2004
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:22,163
A couple things.

2005
01:26:22,163 --> 01:26:26,750
One is this layer five
activation is pretty interesting.

2006
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,310
We're going to come back to layer five

2007
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:31,130
when we talk about yet another emerging

2008
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:33,250
treatment for depression,
which has psilocybin,

2009
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,763
so-called magic mushrooms,

2010
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,980
and the effects of psilocybin
on layer five neurons

2011
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,040
in the cortex.

2012
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,650
So there's a common theme emerging here,

2013
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:45,400
which is that layer five
activity in the cortex

2014
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,260
may be important for rewiring
the brain in certain ways

2015
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:53,260
that can lead to recovery
or to an alleviation

2016
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:56,453
of some of the symptoms
of major depression.

2017
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,460
So if this is sounding a
little bit vague to you,

2018
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:03,420
it's because this is still
truly experimental and new,

2019
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:05,650
and still very much on the cutting edge

2020
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:06,980
of what's happening now.

2021
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,480
We don't have all the answers.

2022
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,580
So if it sounds like I'm
moving slowly through this,

2023
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,579
and I'm being extra
careful about what I say,

2024
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:14,430
you are correct.

2025
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:18,013
Your antenna are correct in this case.

2026
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,800
I never want to misstep and
say something that's not true,

2027
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,010
but that's especially the case

2028
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,280
when we're talking about
experimental therapies and drugs,

2029
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,260
which formerly were
taken as drugs of abuse,

2030
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:30,870
which are now being used as
drugs for therapeutic treatment

2031
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:31,703
in the clinic.

2032
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,890
There is a very interesting study.

2033
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:38,670
This was published in science in 2019.

2034
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,160
So these are very recent studies.

2035
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,480
The last author on this
is Liston, L-I-S-T-O-N.

2036
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,897
The title of the paper is

2037
01:27:45,897 --> 01:27:49,297
"Sustained Rescue of
Prefrontal Circuit Dysfunction

2038
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:52,220
"by Antidepressant
Induced Spine Formation."

2039
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:54,210
And here, when we hear spine,

2040
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,400
we're not referring to
spine as in your vertebrae,

2041
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,067
running down your spinal column,

2042
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:01,130
we're talking about the spines,

2043
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:04,230
which are these little
protrusions on neurons.

2044
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:07,410
Neurons are not smooth by any stretch.

2045
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:10,500
If you zoom in on a neuron,
if you were to come to my lab

2046
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,170
and look down the microscope
at a neuron and zoom in on it,

2047
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,480
you'd find that some neurons are smooth,

2048
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,390
but most neurons have
these little protrusions.

2049
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,440
And those little protrusions
are called spines.

2050
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:22,030
And those little spiny
protrusions are little sites

2051
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,940
where neurons can reach
out and form and receive

2052
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,790
new synapses from neighboring neurons.

2053
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:29,920
So they increase the
surface area of a neuron

2054
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,000
and allow new connections to be formed.

2055
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,390
And so spine formation is
synonymous with neuroplasticity,

2056
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,850
which is synonymous with
changes in circuit function,

2057
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:42,570
which is synonymous with changes
in the ways that we think,

2058
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:45,190
we feel, and we behave.

2059
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:47,960
And what was shown in the
study is really interesting.

2060
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,900
What they showed is that ketamine

2061
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,440
can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly

2062
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,950
by changing or increasing in this case,

2063
01:28:56,950 --> 01:29:00,700
the spines on these neurons
in the prefrontal cortex.

2064
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:02,780
And if that word prefrontal rings a bell,

2065
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,903
well, now you remember the
phosphocreatine system,

2066
01:29:05,903 --> 01:29:10,660
the ingestion of creatine
monohydrate, and the forebrain,

2067
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:14,060
activation of the
forebrain were related to,

2068
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,360
in some way or another,
to relief or improvement

2069
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,430
of major depressive symptoms.

2070
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,850
So we're starting to
converge on a picture here

2071
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:24,453
whereby these drugs, ketamine, PCP,

2072
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:27,410
used in a therapeutic context,

2073
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:30,580
may be increasing neuroplasticity.

2074
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:33,680
Literally the changing of
neurocircuits in the forebrain

2075
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,590
somehow through dissociative states.

2076
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:38,690
And I don't want to speculate too much

2077
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,640
about how that might come about,

2078
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,760
but one of the things
that's such a resounding

2079
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,650
or repeating theme of major depression

2080
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:50,110
is that when you talk to somebody
who has major depression,

2081
01:29:50,110 --> 01:29:52,040
it is a real downer.

2082
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,230
And I'm not being
disparaging of those people.

2083
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,420
But if you've ever had a conversation

2084
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,010
with someone who's depressed,

2085
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,230
they're always talking about
how exhausted they are,

2086
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:01,180
or in really severe cases,

2087
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:02,860
they are not even responsive at all.

2088
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:06,530
They just kind of stare at you
blankly, or they fall asleep.

2089
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:08,190
I mean, they're truly depressed.

2090
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:12,170
Their system is lowered in
terms of its activation state.

2091
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:16,750
So I think that it's
interesting that the application

2092
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:20,720
of drugs that allow people
to separate from that state

2093
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,600
of not caring or being
uninterested or unwilling

2094
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,720
to do anything is actually
one of the paths to treatment.

2095
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,300
It's not always about
just getting people peppy

2096
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,470
and excited and happy.

2097
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:32,950
There also seems to be requirement

2098
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:36,390
for getting them distanced
from their own grief.

2099
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,730
And this brings us back to
something that we talked about

2100
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,890
way back at the beginning of this episode,

2101
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:43,970
which was this particular feature

2102
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:46,810
of the anti self confabulation,

2103
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:49,350
that everything that
happens is a reflection

2104
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:50,980
that I should say for
the depressed person,

2105
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,790
that everything that
happens is a reflection

2106
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:54,990
of how life is bad and their experiences

2107
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:58,140
just point to the fact that
nothing is going to get better.

2108
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,140
This is the common language of depression.

2109
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:03,170
If this is very depressing
to hear me talk about it,

2110
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:04,090
it is heavy.

2111
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:06,370
And that's what it's like
to hear these things,

2112
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:07,470
it's even heavier, of course,

2113
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:09,510
for somebody to experience them.

2114
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:14,510
And those beliefs, those
patterns of guilt and grief

2115
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:18,890
and anhedonia and delusional
anti self confabulation,

2116
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,530
those are the things that eventually,

2117
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:22,170
if they get severe enough,

2118
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:26,220
start to convert into things
like self harm mutilation,

2119
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:29,610
and in the most tragic of
cases, of course, suicide.

2120
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:33,460
And so I think we can
look to these treatments

2121
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,700
such as ketamine and PCP,

2122
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,670
but in particular ketamine
and its use in the clinic,

2123
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:42,700
as ways for people to get
distanced from the negative affect

2124
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:46,640
that they feel isn't just
inside them or overwhelms them,

2125
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,330
but that for the very
severely depressed person,

2126
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:51,460
they feel is them.

2127
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:54,100
And we hear this sometimes,
you are not your emotions.

2128
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:55,650
That's a statement that I've
always been a little bit

2129
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:56,483
challenged by.

2130
01:31:56,483 --> 01:32:01,170
I mean, yes, indeed
emotions are not who we are.

2131
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:03,150
They are states that
we go into and out of,

2132
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:04,990
including happiness and sadness,

2133
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:08,980
but they are very much a part
of us when we experience them.

2134
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,250
We don't experience them
as next to us or behind us

2135
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,880
or across the room from us.

2136
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,940
We experienced them as our emotions.

2137
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:18,650
They are so much part and
parcel with our experience

2138
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:22,350
of ourself that a statement
like we aren't our emotions

2139
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:24,160
is a very hard statement to digest,

2140
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,060
especially for the depressed person.

2141
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:30,110
And so I think that the NMDA
receptor and its capacity

2142
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:32,520
to induce neuroplasticity,
circuit changes,

2143
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,860
the fact that PCP and
ketamine are both showing

2144
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:38,700
activation of neural circuits
by way of suppressing

2145
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,190
activity of the NMDA receptor,

2146
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:43,470
and some of the positive or
exciting therapeutic outcomes

2147
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:45,790
that are coming from this
really point to the fact

2148
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:50,790
that ketamine and PCP and
removal of negative experiences

2149
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:53,710
or the experience of
a negative experience,

2150
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:55,120
sort of getting meta there.

2151
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,950
But the experience of
a negative experience

2152
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:59,840
may be an important path by which people

2153
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,660
treat their depression, especially
in its most severe forms

2154
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,980
where people are veering
towards self-harm, mutilation,

2155
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,530
and suicide.

2156
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:08,900
So you may have noticed a theme,

2157
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,120
which is that certain
categories of approaches

2158
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,740
that we've been discussing for offsetting

2159
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:16,500
the symptoms of depression,
such as exercise,

2160
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,830
ingesting EPAs, reducing inflammation,

2161
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:22,723
or even the SSRIs for
increasing serotonin,

2162
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:27,470
focus on changing some
core biological function,

2163
01:33:27,470 --> 01:33:29,740
like raising the amount
of a chemical, serotonin,

2164
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:33,410
or reducing the amount
of inflammatory cytokines

2165
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:34,513
in the brain and body.

2166
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:38,270
And yet things like ketamine

2167
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:40,760
focus more on rewiring circuitry,

2168
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,980
changing neural circuitry
so that it functions better

2169
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:46,420
in the immediate and hopefully
in the long-term as well,

2170
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,080
and keep people with major depression

2171
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:52,150
in what they call, remission,
away from major depression.

2172
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:53,820
Another category of treatments

2173
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,080
that's being actively
explored now in laboratories

2174
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:00,820
and in the psychiatry
realm are the psychedelics.

2175
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:03,853
And that's a huge category of compounds.

2176
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:06,650
However, one in particular,

2177
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:09,860
psilocybin is one that's
being most intensely

2178
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,070
and actively pursued for its capacity

2179
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:14,270
to treat major depressive disorder.

2180
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:16,310
I want to be very clear that the work

2181
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:18,900
that I'm going to describe
as work that's being done

2182
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,870
in university settings,
university hospitals,

2183
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:25,860
by scientists and psychiatrists,

2184
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,270
and these are clinical
studies, clinical trials,

2185
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:30,380
leading to peer reviewed data.

2186
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,260
And those are the data
that we'll be discussing.

2187
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:36,520
Some of the major luminaries
in this area include,

2188
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,211
of course aren't limited to,

2189
01:34:38,211 --> 01:34:39,044
but include people like Matthew Johnson

2190
01:34:39,044 --> 01:34:40,350
who's at Johns Hopkins.

2191
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:42,920
We'll discuss some of his
work now, and fortunate to say

2192
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,980
that he will be coming
on the podcast as a guest

2193
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:49,350
to just scribe the studies
in a variety of laboratories,

2194
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,740
working on a variety of
different psychedelic compounds,

2195
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:55,700
but let's focus on
psilocybin for its capacity

2196
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:59,323
to rewire neural circuits
and alleviate depression.

2197
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:04,540
There have been anecdotal data
or evidence over the years

2198
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:07,730
that psilocybin has this capacity,
how does psilocybin work?

2199
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:11,630
Well, psilocybin, magic mushrooms,
as it's sometimes called,

2200
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:15,337
mainly works on what's called
the serotonin 5H2A receptor

2201
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:20,020
with some affinity for the 5HT1 receptor.

2202
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:20,853
What does that mean?

2203
01:35:20,853 --> 01:35:22,260
Well, basically, you've
got a lot of different

2204
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,640
kinds of serotonin
receptors just as you have

2205
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,510
a lot of different kinds
of dopamine receptors

2206
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,240
or other types of receptors.

2207
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,330
The advantage of having
different receptors

2208
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:33,040
expressed in different
parts of the brain and body,

2209
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,570
even on different parts
of individual cells

2210
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:38,670
in the brain and body is that
the same compound, serotonin,

2211
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,970
can have a diverse set of effects

2212
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:42,580
on different cells and tissues.

2213
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:45,720
This is also the basis of some
of the side effect profiles

2214
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:50,060
of SSRIs, because maybe for instance,

2215
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,540
we know that taking Prozac fluoxetine

2216
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:54,080
will increase serotonin in one area,

2217
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,320
but also in another area.

2218
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,540
And then they will go have diverse effects

2219
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,820
on different brain circuits

2220
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,900
because of the variety of receptors.

2221
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,880
Receptors are just like parking slots

2222
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,060
where the molecule serotonin parks

2223
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,540
and has different effects.

2224
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,980
Well psilocybin engages

2225
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,810
or increases serotonin transmission,

2226
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,450
meaning it increases
the amount of serotonin,

2227
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:19,030
mainly by acting at these 5H2A receptors,

2228
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,230
but where in the brain does it happen

2229
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:22,460
and what are the major effects?

2230
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,890
First, let's talk about the major effects

2231
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:26,150
'cause I think that's what
people are interested in.

2232
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:29,950
The study that I'd like to
highlight is a fairly recent one.

2233
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:33,780
It was published in may of 2021 in Journal

2234
01:36:34,842 --> 01:36:37,280
of the American Medical
Association Psychiatry,

2235
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,287
so JAMA Psychiatry, and it's entitled,

2236
01:36:40,287 --> 01:36:42,407
"Effects of Psilocybin Assisted Therapy

2237
01:36:42,407 --> 01:36:45,850
"on Major Depressive Disorder,
a Randomized Clinical Trial."

2238
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:49,090
It's an absolutely beautiful
study, a very important study.

2239
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,140
It includes some of the
luminaries in this area

2240
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,670
like Matthew Johnson, Patrick Finan,

2241
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:55,360
Roland Griffiths, and others.

2242
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,210
We will provide a link to this study.

2243
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:02,120
It is available in its
full form at zero cost

2244
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,953
if you want to read it.

2245
01:37:02,953 --> 01:37:03,840
It's got a lot of detail.

2246
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,410
So I'm just going to
summarize a few things,

2247
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:09,510
but basically what they did
was they screened for patients

2248
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:10,430
to come into the clinic.

2249
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:11,460
These were people that suffered

2250
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:13,870
from major depressive disorder,

2251
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:18,870
and administered either one
or two rounds of psilocybin.

2252
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,660
They used particular dosages
that are listed in the study.

2253
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,020
So you can look it up if
you're really interested

2254
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,710
in that level of detail.

2255
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:29,290
Typically it was 20 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight.

2256
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:30,830
So it depends on body weight.

2257
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:35,390
Or 30 milligrams of
psilocybin per 70 kilograms

2258
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:36,960
of body weight.

2259
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,140
They were given in capsule form.

2260
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,640
So people weren't eating the mushrooms.

2261
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,440
This is obviously a very controlled study

2262
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:46,230
and they wanted to control
the dosages appropriately.

2263
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,650
They were randomized to begin
the treatment immediately

2264
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:50,800
or after an eight week delay.

2265
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,480
They had all the
appropriate control groups

2266
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,010
that one would like to see.

2267
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:56,430
What's really striking this study

2268
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:00,760
is that there was a very
significant improvement

2269
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:04,370
in mood and affect and relief
from depressive symptoms

2270
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:09,210
in anywhere from 50 to 70% of the people

2271
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:12,480
that were subjects in
the study who received

2272
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:16,170
the psilocybin treatment.

2273
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,070
And whether or not it was 50
or whether or not it was 71%,

2274
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,110
varied according to how
long after the study

2275
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:25,420
they maintain these
antidepressive effects,

2276
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,700
whether or not they stayed in
remission from the depression,

2277
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:30,847
but these are really enormous
insignificant effects,

2278
01:38:30,847 --> 01:38:35,670
and very exciting and are
pointing in the direction

2279
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:39,670
of psilocybin very soon,
becoming a treatment

2280
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:43,840
for various forms of depression,
including major depression.

2281
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,080
Now, of course, this is
limited to the laboratory

2282
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,210
at present.

2283
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:50,180
There are a number of
elements of these studies

2284
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,020
that are important to take
into consideration too,

2285
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:55,380
which is that there are
highly trained guides,

2286
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,650
meaning people to direct
people through the experience.

2287
01:38:58,650 --> 01:39:00,710
As Matthew Johnson has told me,

2288
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:03,640
there is the occurrence from time to time

2289
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,410
of people having so-called bad trips

2290
01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:08,000
of having anxiety attacks
during the hallucinations

2291
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,833
and all that.

2292
01:39:08,833 --> 01:39:10,980
And they have ways to mitigate
that and deal with that

2293
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,810
because the guides are trained.

2294
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:16,730
They have all the sorts of
medical monitoring devices

2295
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:18,300
for heart rate and temperature and things

2296
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:22,010
that one would like to
see for a study like this,

2297
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:24,330
because these are very powerful compounds.

2298
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:26,830
I don't want to give away any
elements of the discussion

2299
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,310
with Matthew Johnson,

2300
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:30,470
because it will be
released in podcast form

2301
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:33,800
reasonably soon here,
the Huberman Lab podcast.

2302
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,580
But one of the things that came up

2303
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,180
and is a fundamental question that I had,

2304
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,880
that I think probably
many of you are asking,

2305
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,820
is does the experience that
one has on these compounds

2306
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,500
make a difference for whether
or not somebody gains relief

2307
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:50,800
from depression, from these
psilocybin journeys or not?

2308
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,820
In other words, does it
matter what they talk about?

2309
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,950
Does it matter what they think about?

2310
01:39:53,950 --> 01:39:56,020
Does it matter if they have
a good trip or a bad trip?

2311
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:58,740
And I don't want to hold
you in too much suspense,

2312
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,990
I'll let Matthew provide
the more thorough answer.

2313
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:02,650
But what's really interesting

2314
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:07,650
is there are some common themes
to psilocybin administration

2315
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:11,460
and experience that lead to
relief from depressive symptoms,

2316
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:16,460
but they are subjectively very varied,

2317
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,520
meaning that whether or not people feel

2318
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,570
they had a good experience
or a bad experience,

2319
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:24,650
whether or not people
thought about their parents

2320
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:27,470
or thought about the color of the ceiling,

2321
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:30,170
doesn't seem to have too much of an impact

2322
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:32,840
on whether or not they receive relief

2323
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:36,323
during these studies in
these clinical studies.

2324
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:38,900
It seems like different people can have

2325
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:42,810
lots of different experiences
and still receive benefit.

2326
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:45,470
And that points to something deeper.

2327
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:48,200
It points to the fact that these drugs,

2328
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,830
which is really what they are,

2329
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:53,830
are rewiring neural
circuitry in a common way

2330
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:57,030
despite a diversity of
experience while on the drug.

2331
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:58,750
And that itself is really interesting.

2332
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:01,150
And it takes us back to a
place that we've been before

2333
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:04,110
in this discussion, which
is layer five of the cortex.

2334
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,560
This area that ketamine
seems to impact as well

2335
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,223
by generating rhythms of the,

2336
01:41:08,223 --> 01:41:10,210
I mentioned one to three Hertz activity

2337
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:13,290
in layer five of certain
areas of the cortex.

2338
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:17,520
Well, the 5HT1A receptor
is known to be enriched

2339
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,850
in layer five of the cortex,

2340
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:23,570
and layer five of the cortex
is a very interesting area

2341
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:25,130
because it's an area in which

2342
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:27,340
there's a lot of lateral connectivity.

2343
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:30,680
So connections between
different brain areas laterally,

2344
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,600
generally is what allows us
to merge different senses.

2345
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,050
So for instance, when we
hear a sound off to our right

2346
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:39,240
over here, we turn to our right.

2347
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,050
There's a very hardwired response.

2348
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:42,720
And typically we hear
something off to our right,

2349
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,190
we don't look to our left.

2350
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:46,750
That's how hardwired some
of these circuits are.

2351
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:49,370
What appears to be happening
is that the activation

2352
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:53,630
of the serotonin system and
5HT1A receptor in layer five

2353
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:57,490
is offering up or providing an experience

2354
01:41:57,490 --> 01:42:01,300
whereby the lateral
connections are able to engage

2355
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,880
much more broadly than
they would normally.

2356
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:07,120
Now that also could be a bad thing.

2357
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,530
And I asked Matt about this,
that sounds kind of spooky.

2358
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:12,660
I don't know that when I hear
something off to my right,

2359
01:42:12,660 --> 01:42:13,950
that I want to look off to my left.

2360
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:15,490
That could be highly maladaptive,

2361
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:18,500
especially if it's a car
coming at me from my right.

2362
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,030
That doesn't seem to be what's happening.

2363
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:24,080
It's not really rewiring these
deeply reflexive circuits.

2364
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:27,720
It's somehow rewiring
associations between events,

2365
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:30,280
emotional events, past
events, current events,

2366
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:33,140
and future events in
ways that allow people

2367
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:35,750
to get some sort of relief or distance

2368
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:39,180
from these narratives,
these depressive stories

2369
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,500
about their past and
present and allow them

2370
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:44,373
to see new opportunity and
optimism in the future.

2371
01:42:44,373 --> 01:42:47,020
It's really a fascinating thing

2372
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,440
if you really think about it,

2373
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,510
because I would have thought

2374
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:53,910
that simply by ramping up
laterality of connections,

2375
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:56,100
meaning that cross associations,

2376
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,680
that things could either
be rewired randomly

2377
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,300
in ways that don't serve us,

2378
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,900
or would perhaps just
cause no effect at all.

2379
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,520
So it's either going to be bad or neutral,

2380
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,730
but that's not really the
way things are turning out.

2381
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,640
Again, these are highly
controlled studies.

2382
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:13,210
I do want to emphasize
that ketamine, psilocybin,

2383
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:14,780
these things are still illegal.

2384
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,500
Most all places.

2385
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,190
There are some regions and
cities in the United States

2386
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:21,470
where they are locally decriminalized,

2387
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:22,600
but they are not legal.

2388
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,560
They're still illegal.

2389
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:26,550
So what we're referring to here
are indeed clinical studies

2390
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:29,810
in which people are taking them legally.

2391
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:32,940
I think it's very likely
we will see a shift

2392
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:35,420
in the legislature around psychedelics,

2393
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:39,720
and in particular, psilocybin
in the not too distant future.

2394
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:43,190
And I think that for
now, what we should know

2395
01:43:43,190 --> 01:43:47,113
is what Matt told me and what
you'll hear far more about,

2396
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:52,690
which is that psilocybin.
this one where in most cases,

2397
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:55,970
two dose treatments done in
a highly clinical setting,

2398
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:58,560
controlled setting with patients

2399
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,610
that are carefully
selected, can in many cases,

2400
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:05,310
the majority of people
receive and maintain relief

2401
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:07,160
from their depressive symptoms,

2402
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:11,540
simply through the experience
of this psychedelic journey.

2403
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:13,603
I did ask them about micro dosing.

2404
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,008
I made it sound as if I'd
never heard about it before.

2405
01:44:17,008 --> 01:44:18,940
Microdosing, not micro dosing.

2406
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:22,700
Microdosing, and his
answer was interesting.

2407
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,520
His answer was that
the microdosing effects

2408
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,603
don't seem to be nearly as
impactful as some of these,

2409
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:31,350
well, let's just call them what they are.

2410
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:34,530
These kind of high amplitude sessions

2411
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:37,860
that there are just one or two,

2412
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,780
there are some studies ongoing
where there's more than two,

2413
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:43,180
but that the microdosing
doesn't seem to compare

2414
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:47,660
to these macrodosing, I
mentioned the dosages before,

2415
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:49,670
this 20 milligrams per 70 kilograms

2416
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:53,159
or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms dosages

2417
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:56,010
given several weeks apart.

2418
01:44:56,010 --> 01:44:58,270
So you'll hear more about microdosing

2419
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:00,480
and other psychedelics and their impact

2420
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:04,230
on depressive states and major depression

2421
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:05,690
in the episode with Matt.

2422
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:08,270
But for the time being, it
really seems as if, again,

2423
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:09,620
we're looking at neuroplasticity,

2424
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,080
we're coming back to layer five,

2425
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,100
just like with ketamine and PCP.

2426
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:14,370
We're hearing about layer five,

2427
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:15,980
we're hearing about rewiring of circuitry,

2428
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,610
we're hearing about a
dissociation or a distancing

2429
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:23,300
of oneself from these
negative moods and affects

2430
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,880
and narratives, but
there's a key distinction

2431
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:30,170
between the ketamine work
and the psilocybin work,

2432
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:31,550
which is that in the ketamine work,

2433
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:34,610
it really is about
dissociating from experience

2434
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:36,850
during the session with the psychiatrist,

2435
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:38,790
whereas during the psilocybin journey,

2436
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:41,770
it's really about immersing
oneself in the experience

2437
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:43,890
and being fully present
to that experience.

2438
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:45,750
That does seem to be
an important component

2439
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:47,490
and what the difference is there

2440
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:50,600
and why they both seem
to provide some relief

2441
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,480
from major depression isn't clear.

2442
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,430
I think most likely it
takes us back to the fact

2443
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:59,290
that this thing we call major depression

2444
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:03,530
clearly involves serotonin,
dopamine, and norepinephrine.

2445
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,190
And in some individuals,
they may be more deficient

2446
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:08,650
in one or several of
those or all of those,

2447
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:09,780
whereas in other individuals,

2448
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,230
it might be a different
collection of chemicals.

2449
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:14,410
And of course there
are a tremendous number

2450
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:18,620
of other psychedelic compounds
that people are exploring

2451
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:21,270
for treatment of major depression.

2452
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:22,650
But really psilocybin is the one

2453
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,590
that we have the most data on.

2454
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:29,100
MDMA has mainly been explored
in the clinical realm

2455
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,300
for treatment of trauma.

2456
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:34,470
There are some trials ongoing
for treatment of depression,

2457
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:38,200
but the big breakthrough
seemed to be happening

2458
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,440
in the realm of trauma treatment,

2459
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,520
the so-called maps
group that's doing this,

2460
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,890
again, legally in a clinical setting.

2461
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:45,890
And there are other groups

2462
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,310
that are starting to do it as well.

2463
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:50,557
We are going to do an
entire podcast about MDMA

2464
01:46:50,557 --> 01:46:52,240
and some related compounds.

2465
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,610
So I'll save that discussion for then.

2466
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:57,370
One of the most common
questions I get for this podcast

2467
01:46:57,370 --> 01:47:00,760
is about different
diets, different regimes,

2468
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:03,377
different nutritional
plans, things like keto,

2469
01:47:03,377 --> 01:47:08,040
ketogenic diet, or vegan
diets, or intermittent fasting,

2470
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:11,790
or the all meat diet, the
so-called lion diet, et cetera.

2471
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:14,410
There are actually really interesting data

2472
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:18,760
relating nutrition and diet
to major depressive disorder.

2473
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:21,690
And I think we just need to frame this

2474
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:23,600
by returning to something
that was said earlier,

2475
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,720
which is that the
ingestion of carbohydrates,

2476
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,680
in particular carbohydrates
and some meats like turkey,

2477
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:34,680
that are rich in tryptophan,
this precursor to serotonin,

2478
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:39,680
are in many ways the
self-medicating version

2479
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:41,750
of depression treatment.

2480
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,180
Now, to be clear, I'm not saying

2481
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:46,140
that people should use food
to medicate their depression.

2482
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,350
Many people do that reflexively however,

2483
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:50,270
they reach for carbohydrate rich foods

2484
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:53,790
to blunt their cortisol, because
that's indeed what it does.

2485
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:56,120
It blunts cortisol when you
ingest high carbohydrate foods,

2486
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,750
in particular starchy foods,

2487
01:47:57,750 --> 01:48:00,840
and it does increase serotonin,

2488
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,810
in particular, if those
foods rather are rich

2489
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:06,940
in the amino acid tryptophan.

2490
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:10,360
Now ingesting food is wonderful
and important and great,

2491
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,420
but ingesting excessive
foods of any kinds,

2492
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:16,470
carbohydrate or otherwise
it's not healthy, of course.

2493
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:19,240
There have been some explorations

2494
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:22,050
of whether or not a vegan diet can improve

2495
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:23,150
symptoms of depression.

2496
01:48:23,150 --> 01:48:25,500
Not a lot of data, not impressive data.

2497
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,750
There have been very
few controlled studies

2498
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:31,140
looking at the carnivore or all meat diet.

2499
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:32,740
On that, I think there are now some

2500
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,060
that are starting to spin up,

2501
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:35,580
meaning those studies
are starting to spin up.

2502
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:39,170
However, the ketogenic
diet has been explored

2503
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:44,000
for its ability to relieve
certain symptoms of depression,

2504
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:49,461
in particular to what's
called maintain euthymia.

2505
01:48:49,461 --> 01:48:51,850
Euthymia is the kind
of state of equilibrium

2506
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:55,060
between a manic episode
and a depressive episode

2507
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:56,380
in a manic bipolar person.

2508
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:58,250
We'll return to this
more in a future episode,

2509
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:01,890
but it basically, maniacs
have highs and they have lows,

2510
01:49:01,890 --> 01:49:04,360
bipolars, either cycle back
and forth really quickly.

2511
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:07,400
So rapid cycling bipolars
or slow, some people

2512
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,250
So really quickly can be day to day,

2513
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:11,160
other people it's month
to month or week to week,

2514
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:13,490
they're going highs and lows.

2515
01:49:13,490 --> 01:49:16,090
And you hear about mania and
you hear about dysphoria,

2516
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:19,200
euthymia is that kind
of place in the middle

2517
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:22,890
where people feel neither
too high nor too low.

2518
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:25,210
And there are some interesting studies

2519
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:28,450
looking at the ketogenic
diet for maintaining euthymia

2520
01:49:28,450 --> 01:49:29,740
in manic depressives,

2521
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:32,570
but also in people with
major depressive disorder.

2522
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:33,630
Why would this work?

2523
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:36,630
Well, we have to remember
that the ketogenic diet

2524
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:41,460
wasn't discovered so that
self appointed nutrition gurus

2525
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,410
could talk about it
online or so that people

2526
01:49:44,410 --> 01:49:48,050
could make money selling
anything related to ketosis.

2527
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:49,970
And here I'm not disparaging
of the ketogenic diet.

2528
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:50,803
It's helped a lot of people.

2529
01:49:50,803 --> 01:49:53,640
The ketogenic diet was actually shown

2530
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:58,640
to be medically relevant for
its use to treat epilepsy.

2531
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:02,840
It turns out that in epilepsy,

2532
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,330
or in particular pediatric epilepsy,

2533
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:09,620
that a ketogenic diet and
the shift of brain metabolism

2534
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:12,870
to predominantly one in which
ketones are being metabolized

2535
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:17,720
rather than more standard
glucose tight metabolism,

2536
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:20,820
can greatly reduce the
number of epileptic seizures

2537
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:22,780
that these children experience.

2538
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:24,357
It's not always the case,
but it's often the case.

2539
01:50:24,357 --> 01:50:27,360
And so you talk to a
neurologist or a neurosurgeon

2540
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:31,350
who's specialized in epilepsy,

2541
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:34,087
in particular pediatric epilepsy,
and they'll tell you this,

2542
01:50:34,087 --> 01:50:36,817
"Oh yeah, the ketogenic
diet, in many cases, not all,

2543
01:50:36,817 --> 01:50:38,780
"can be very effective
for this treatment."

2544
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:40,000
How?

2545
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,640
How is it that a ketogenic
diet reduces seizures?

2546
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,420
Well, the way it reduces seizures

2547
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:49,980
is by increasing what's
called GABA transmission.

2548
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:54,300
GABA is a substance that is
naturally released in our brain.

2549
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,400
It's an inhibitory neurotransmitter,

2550
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,010
meaning that when it's
released into the synapse,

2551
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:01,760
it has the tendency to reduce the firing,

2552
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,760
to reduce the electrical
activity of the next neuron

2553
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:06,023
or sets of neurons.

2554
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:09,550
There are various compounds
that increase GABA,

2555
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:10,960
in particular, GABA in the forebrain.

2556
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:14,570
One common example would
be something like alcohol,

2557
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:16,960
drinking alcoholic drink or two

2558
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,990
will increase GABA transmission,

2559
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:23,010
ironically will lower
your social inhibitions

2560
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:26,010
by increasing your
neurochemical inhibition.

2561
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:30,060
It basically suppresses the
self-monitoring pathways.

2562
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,030
And if people drink enough,

2563
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:32,247
it will suppress all pathways

2564
01:51:32,247 --> 01:51:34,880
and people will urinate
themselves and fall over.

2565
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,520
It will eventually inhibit
all sorts of pathways.

2566
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,270
So the GABA system has
a rich array of effects

2567
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:42,960
all over the brain and body.

2568
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,190
But alcohol tends to
activate the release of GABA.

2569
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:49,550
You might say, well then
why not just take alcohol

2570
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:50,383
to suppress seizures?

2571
01:51:50,383 --> 01:51:51,530
Well, that be a terrible idea

2572
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:54,170
because there tends to
be a rebound excitability

2573
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:57,720
after alcohol stops having its effects

2574
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,920
on the GABA receptors.

2575
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:00,690
And so then there's an excitability

2576
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:03,160
for which an epilepsy would be terrible.

2577
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,150
The reason why the epileptic
diet is useful for epilepsy

2578
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:09,627
is that increases what
we call the tonic level,

2579
01:52:09,627 --> 01:52:13,890
the sort of the ti, the
level of GABA in the brain,

2580
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:16,630
and that suppresses some
of the hyperexcitability,

2581
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:20,220
that is the characteristic
feature of epilepsy.

2582
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,940
And there are other drugs, for instance,

2583
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:26,620
the benzodiazepines and
things of the Xanax, variety,

2584
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,260
Valium, and so forth.

2585
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:30,130
Those increased GABA transmission.

2586
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:32,670
Those drugs also have a
lot of potential for abuse

2587
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:34,040
and addiction, et cetera,

2588
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,010
and they're problematic for other reasons.

2589
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:38,660
But the ketogenic diet,

2590
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,950
by way of increasing ketone metabolism

2591
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:44,610
or shifting brain's
metabolism over to ketones

2592
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:49,610
tends to modulate GABA such
that GABA is more active

2593
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:54,040
and adjust the so-called
GABA glutamate balance.

2594
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,050
This is getting technical,

2595
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:58,100
but glutamate is an
excitatory neurotransmitter,

2596
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:59,770
GABA is inhibitory neurotransmitter,

2597
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:02,520
and their balance is
vital for neuroplasticity,

2598
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:05,770
for maintaining healthy levels
of activity in the brain,

2599
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:06,830
et cetera.

2600
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:10,160
And so there is decent evidence

2601
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,370
that people with major
depressive disorders,

2602
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:17,190
in particular, the people with
major depressive disorders

2603
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:20,790
that are refractory,
meaning they don't respond

2604
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:23,113
to classical antidepressants,

2605
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:28,860
can benefit, it seems,
from the ketogenic diet.

2606
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:30,270
Now this is not always the case,

2607
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:33,040
but for those of you out
there who are struggling

2608
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,100
with major depression, and for
which drugs have not worked,

2609
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:36,410
please talk to your psychiatrist.

2610
01:53:36,410 --> 01:53:38,400
I don't know how many of
them are up on the literature

2611
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:42,900
about the ketogenic diet
or the EPAs and the rest.

2612
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,530
Psychiatrists vary in
terms of how involved

2613
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:47,470
in the current literature they tend to be,

2614
01:53:47,470 --> 01:53:49,920
but there are many excellent
psychiatrists out there.

2615
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,600
Most of them in my experience,

2616
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:55,677
are actually quite avid
learners about what's happening

2617
01:53:55,677 --> 01:53:59,290
and what's new in this realm
that they call psychiatry.

2618
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:03,030
So it's really interesting that
eating in a particular way,

2619
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:05,920
lowering carbohydrates to
the point where you rely

2620
01:54:06,772 --> 01:54:09,020
on ketogenic metabolism in the brain,

2621
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:11,960
increases GABA and can provide some relief

2622
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,820
for depressive symptoms.

2623
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:16,890
And that in particular, that
seems to have positive effects

2624
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:19,270
in people that are
refractory or don't respond

2625
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:21,070
to classic antidepressants.

2626
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:24,090
And that would include things
like fluoxetine, et cetera.

2627
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:26,740
I'll make one final point
about ketogenic diets

2628
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,970
and GABA and depression,

2629
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:29,970
which is that it's also been shown

2630
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:34,840
that for people that
respond well to these drugs

2631
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,290
that impact the serotonin
system, dopamine system,

2632
01:54:37,290 --> 01:54:40,210
or norepinephrine, the ketogenic diet,

2633
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:43,790
there may improve the ability

2634
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:45,620
for those drugs to work at lower dosages,

2635
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:48,010
which is reminiscent of
what we saw with the EPA

2636
01:54:48,010 --> 01:54:49,170
supplementation.

2637
01:54:49,170 --> 01:54:51,860
So today we've covered
what at least feels to me,

2638
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,870
like a tremendous amount of material.

2639
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:56,560
This topic of depression
is indeed an enormous topic

2640
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,200
to try and get our arms around.

2641
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:59,530
We talked about the symptomology,

2642
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:01,227
we talked about some of the
underlying neurochemistry

2643
01:55:01,227 --> 01:55:02,530
and biology,

2644
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:04,800
and then we talked about
approaches to deal with it

2645
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:08,740
that are really grounded in
the neurochemistry in biology.

2646
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:11,520
I just want to recap a few of those tools

2647
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,820
and what those things are.

2648
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:14,683
First of all,

2649
01:55:14,683 --> 01:55:17,600
we talked about making the
effort to not overwhelm

2650
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,110
the pleasure system.

2651
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:20,670
That might seem counterintuitive.

2652
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:22,700
To not overly seek out pleasure,

2653
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:26,530
or else one can find themselves
in a place of depression.

2654
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:29,090
I mentioned way back at the
beginning of the episode,

2655
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:32,760
a young man who I know
to be really struggling

2656
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:36,060
with depression, and it is thought,

2657
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:38,130
and we don't know for sure, but is thought

2658
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:40,210
that some of that depression
was probably triggered

2659
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:42,650
by an overindulgence in video games

2660
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:45,410
and other highly dopaminergic activities

2661
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:47,650
to the point where those
activities eventually

2662
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:50,890
were countered by the pain balance that

2663
01:55:50,890 --> 01:55:52,720
Dr. Anna Lembke described.

2664
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:57,180
And he now has to do those
activities repeatedly

2665
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:00,090
and for many, many hours
each day, just to feel okay,

2666
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:02,450
not even to derive pleasure from them.

2667
01:56:02,450 --> 01:56:06,010
And worse, many other activities,

2668
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:09,570
practically all other
activities have lost their zest,

2669
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:12,360
they've lost their excitement
and his sense of pleasure

2670
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,210
for them.

2671
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:15,960
And so there's a really
active campaign now

2672
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,860
to reset that system.

2673
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:22,060
So, number one, don't
overwhelm your pleasure centers

2674
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:24,110
either through activities or compounds.

2675
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:25,440
Might seem counterintuitive,

2676
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,590
but you're setting yourself up
for anhedonia and depression

2677
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,423
if you do that.

2678
01:56:29,423 --> 01:56:31,040
It's not just about addiction that too,

2679
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,580
but it's also about setting
yourself for anhedonia

2680
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,200
and depression.

2681
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,500
How often can you engage
in these activities?

2682
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,440
Well, that's going to differ
from person to person,

2683
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,930
everyone's slightly different,

2684
01:56:40,930 --> 01:56:43,520
but you should really
mind your extreme highs

2685
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,310
and your extreme lows and
be cautious about those.

2686
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:49,230
We'll probably have a Dr.
Lembke on again at a future time

2687
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:51,330
to try and get some more
specifics about that.

2688
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:54,700
But if you do feel like you
need to reset that system,

2689
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:58,980
it really does seem like
a 30 day complete detox

2690
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:01,150
from whatever activity
or substance that is.

2691
01:57:01,150 --> 01:57:03,900
And ideally it doesn't
continue after that 30 days,

2692
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:06,920
especially in conditions
of drugs of abuse.

2693
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:10,140
Second of all, talks about
the norepinephrine system

2694
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:12,920
and how the norepinephrine
system is really deficient

2695
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:16,480
in many forms of major depression.

2696
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:20,580
And in depression, there is
now more deliberate pursuit

2697
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,120
of nor epinephrin inducing
activities that are healthy,

2698
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,300
that aren't adrenaline seeking per se,

2699
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:27,550
things like cold showers,

2700
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:31,550
things like particular
patterns of breathing

2701
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:35,320
that engage and tend
to make us more alert,

2702
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:38,060
things like exercise that
will increase our levels

2703
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:39,180
of noradrenaline.

2704
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:42,070
I'd be remiss if I said
that these activities

2705
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:45,370
could completely eliminate
depressive symptoms

2706
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:46,900
in people with major depressive disorder.

2707
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:47,890
I don't think that's the case.

2708
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:48,900
And again, I want to acknowledge

2709
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,940
that people with major depressive symptoms

2710
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:54,000
often don't have the
energy, the willingness,

2711
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,160
or the capacity to engage
in some of these activities,

2712
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:00,040
but things like cold shower,
deliberate cold showers,

2713
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,340
things like regular exercise,

2714
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:05,170
they aren't just feel good activities.

2715
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:07,500
They actually engage the
norepinephrine system

2716
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:10,130
and keep that system tuned
up and allow us to increase

2717
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:13,060
our norepinephrine levels
at will on a regular basis.

2718
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:15,670
And their mood enhancing
effects are real effects

2719
01:58:15,670 --> 01:58:17,880
at the level of neurochemistry,

2720
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,230
then we talked about EPAs,
Essential Fatty Acids,

2721
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:23,120
and it's clear that for most people,

2722
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,940
getting above 1000 milligrams

2723
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:28,300
and probably even closer to
2000 milligrams per day of EPAs

2724
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:31,870
can be beneficial for mood,
especially in attempts to treat

2725
01:58:31,870 --> 01:58:34,690
or offset major depressive disorder.

2726
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:35,640
Are there side effects?

2727
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,850
Well, you need to explore
those for yourself

2728
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:38,683
and with your doctor,

2729
01:58:38,683 --> 01:58:40,620
everyone has a different
health background.

2730
01:58:41,939 --> 01:58:43,240
For the margins of safety,

2731
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,920
for most people would
probably be quite large,

2732
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,540
but for some people that
might not be the case.

2733
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:51,000
So definitely check with your physician.

2734
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,970
We also talked about exercise
and how EPA and exercise

2735
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:57,180
on a regular basis can offset
these inflammatory pathways.

2736
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,630
I want to mention something I've mentioned

2737
01:58:58,630 --> 01:58:59,720
on a previous podcast,

2738
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:02,160
but in terms of keeping the Inflammatone,

2739
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,330
all these molecules that
create inflammation,

2740
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:07,060
and then the inflammation can
limit the amount of serotonin

2741
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:08,670
through the pathways we described.

2742
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:12,760
In order to do that, it's
also very, very useful

2743
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:16,080
to ingest two to four
servings of fermented foods

2744
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,960
on a daily basis or near daily basis.

2745
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,960
These are data that were
published by the Sonnenberg Lab

2746
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:22,070
at Stanford recently in the journal Cell,

2747
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:24,290
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal

2748
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:27,640
that ingestion of these fermented foods

2749
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:31,410
really keeps the gut microbiome
tuned up, so to speak,

2750
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:34,190
well in order to offset
these inflammatory cytokines,

2751
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:35,810
keeping inflammation at bay,

2752
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:38,070
it just turns out to
be a really good thing

2753
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:40,790
in order to keep our mood in a good place.

2754
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:42,670
So EPA, exercise, fermented foods,

2755
01:59:42,670 --> 01:59:45,910
creatine as a potential source
of relief from depression

2756
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:49,370
or offsetting, or keeping us
away from major depression

2757
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:50,880
or relapse into depression.

2758
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,630
And then we talked about
the prescription compounds

2759
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:55,130
and the compounds that are being used

2760
01:59:55,130 --> 01:59:57,960
mainly in the course of
studies and of psychiatry

2761
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:00,680
and depression, things like
ketamine, PCP, psilocybin,

2762
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:01,700
and related compounds.

2763
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:03,530
And then lastly, we talked about ketosis,

2764
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:04,990
which may not be right for everybody,

2765
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:08,100
but might be right for
certain individuals out there

2766
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,500
who are grappling with this.

2767
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,000

Throughout the course of today's episode

2793
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:07,060
and in previous episodes,

2794
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:10,590
I mentioned supplements that
may be appropriate for you.

2795
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:12,900
If you want to check out
the supplements that I take,

2796
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,410
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

2797
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:22,410

2805
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:40,430
We partnered with Thorne
because they have the absolutely

2806
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:43,060
highest levels of stringency
in terms of the quality

2807
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,990
and quantity of the
supplements that they put

2808
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:47,400
in their formulations.

2809
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,340
And last but not least,
I want to thank you

2810
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:52,230
for embarking on this journey
of trying to understand

2811
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:55,510
what is depression, how does
it work, and how to treat it.

2812
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:57,861
And thank you for your
interest in science.
