ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome
to the Huberman Lab podcast,

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,970
for everyday life.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,100
[MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,000
of neurobiology
and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,830
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,380
Today we are
discussing happiness.

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,690
We're going to discuss
the science of happiness,

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,930
because indeed, there are
excellent laboratories that

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,210
have worked for many decades
to try and understand

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,550
what is this thing
that we call happiness

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,700
and what brings us happiness
in the short and long term.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,700
In fact, we could probably
point to happiness

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,510
as one of the most sought-after
states or commodities,

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,360
or emotions.

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,120
Whatever you want to
call it, happiness

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,290
is what many people are seeking
in work, in relationships,

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,770
and in general.

20
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,460
And yet most of us can't
really define exactly what

21
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,490
happiness is or means for us.

22
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,350
We can point to
certain experiences,

23
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,390
we can try and describe our
states of mind and body,

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,770
but most people recognize
the feeling when we have it,

25
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,310
and we certainly recognize the
feeling of not being happy.

26
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,770
Whether or not that means
simply not being happy

27
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,560
as the absence of happiness
or all-out depression.

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,790
Now one of the key problems in
trying to understand happiness

29
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,610
and, indeed, the science
and psychology of happiness

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,660
is that it does indeed
involve other similar things.

31
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,200
Things like joy, and
gratitude, and meaning.

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,170
And indeed, many scientists
and psychologists

33
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,600
have argued for
many, many decades

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,410
about what happiness really is.

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,490
Now we can come up with
so-called operational

36
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,660
definitions of happiness.

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,500
Operational definitions are
basically agreed-upon terms

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,560
or agreed-upon
definitions and conditions

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,020
that will define something
such as happiness.

40
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,360
Much in the same way
that we can all probably

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,580
come up with an operational
definition of milk.

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,940
But of course, milk can be
cow's milk, it can be oat milk,

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,980
it can be soy milk,
et cetera, et cetera.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,870
So too, something
like happiness can

45
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,530
be micro-divided and sliced
and diced into as many things

46
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,550
as we decide.

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,710
Today we are really going to
focus on three main things.

48
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,150
First, we are going to define
happiness as a brain state

49
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,018
and as a state of mind and body.

50
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:11,560
We're going to take a look at
what the science says about all

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,060
of that.

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,010
Second, we are going to talk
about tools and practices

53
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,460
for placing ourselves
into states of happiness.

54
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,950
And while for most of
us, we think of happiness

55
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,040
as something that only arrives
through the acquisition

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,130
of some goal or some thing
external to us, and of course,

57
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,380
that is true.

58
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,200
There is also something
called synthetic happiness

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,150
or synthesized happiness
which turns out

60
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,672
to be at least as powerful and
perhaps even more powerful.

61
00:02:37,672 --> 00:02:39,130
Now I'll just say
right off the bat

62
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,380
that I'm not going to tell
you that all you have to do

63
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,120
is sit in a chair and
imagine being happy

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,410
in order to feel happy.

65
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,140
Synthesize happiness actually
involves some very concrete

66
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,720
steps that have been defined by
excellent labs in psychology,

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,800
so we're going to talk
about synthesize happiness

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,490
as it relates to what you can
do to obtain happy states more

69
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,420
readily or more frequently.

70
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,390
And then, third, we're
going to talk about some

71
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,060
of the misconceptions or what
I would call the contradictions

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,620
of happiness research.

73
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,050
And what I mean by
that is most of you

74
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,050
have probably heard about
the general conditions

75
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,220
for obtaining happiness.

76
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,678
And they always
seem to circle back

77
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:17,560
to some of the same basic
features of get great sleep,

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,120
have great social connection,
pursue meaning, don't focus

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,758
to any overextend on
things like pursuing money

80
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,550
because there are indeed
these studies that

81
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,920
show that the amount of
money that people make

82
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,323
does not necessarily scale
directly with happiness.

83
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,740
We'll talk about those studies
in some detail a little bit

84
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,460
later.

85
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,080
And while all of
that literature is

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,410
very powerful and
informative, there

87
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,420
is what I see as
a contradiction.

88
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,283
Which is for instance, that for
many of us, including myself,

89
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,700
especially in the
years when I was

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,890
in graduate school
and a postdoc,

91
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,760
there were times in which
pursuing and being involved

92
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,160
in work and pursuing
degrees and finding

93
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,820
meaning in my vocation
actually separated me

94
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,290
from the opportunity
to have quite

95
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,140
as many social connections,
or quite as much sleep,

96
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,470
or quite as much exercise, or
even quite as much sunshine,

97
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,500
for that matter.

98
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,010
So all of the things that we're
told that we need in order

99
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,390
to access happiness
on a regular basis

100
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,990
oftentimes contradict
with the pressures

101
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,060
and the requirements
of not just daily life

102
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,250
but in building a
life that allows

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,890
us to have the kind of
resources that we need in order

104
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,390
to have things like quality
social connection, and the time

105
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,360
and opportunity to get regular
exercise and great nutrition,

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,590
et cetera, et cetera.

107
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,690
So, again, while this
isn't necessarily

108
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,850
a complaint with any
of the research out

109
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,910
of the fields of
psychology on happiness,

110
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,460
it is important
that we acknowledge

111
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,202
these contradictions that
exist in the discussion

112
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:45,910
around happiness.

113
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,040
In particular, the
popular discussions

114
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,790
around the science of happiness.

115
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,420
So today, what we are
going to arrive at,

116
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,040
what you will
finish this episode,

117
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,520
with is a set of tools and a
framework for understanding

118
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,070
the pursuit of happiness
in the short and long-term

119
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,350
as it relates to the
research from psychology

120
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,420
but also the neuroscience.

121
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
And my goal today is really
to try and place that all

122
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,670
into a structured
framework so that you

123
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,780
can know where you are in
your journey or the landscape

124
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,240
around happiness in your
pursuit of happiness.

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,550
And what I won't
tell you is that you

126
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,470
need to abandon
all goals in terms

127
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,890
of pursuing money,
career, et cetera,

128
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,540
and simply focus
on relationships.

129
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,420
But we will talk
about what constitutes

130
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,780
an excellent social bond or
even in excellent conversation.

131
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,780
There's excellent research
that points to the fact

132
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,960
that even rather shallow
connections, that

133
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,390
is, connections between people
that you happen to just see

134
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,760
in the hallway on
a regular basis,

135
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,300
not even requiring
close bonds of any kind,

136
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,180
can be built into close
bonds that can deliver

137
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,720
a tremendous amount of feeling
and genuine social connection

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,460
provided certain
conditions are met.

139
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,660
So today, again, it's
really about understanding

140
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,330
the science of happiness,
understanding the mechanisms

141
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,890
underlying what
we call happiness.

142
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,440
And providing you a
framework by which

143
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,530
you can pursue and
achieve happiness not just

144
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,410
as a long-term goal and not
just as a day-to-day goal

145
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,290
of little micro exercises
of gratitude, et cetera,

146
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,930
but rather as a way to
think about happiness

147
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,930
as a state that you have
control over, at least

148
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,700
in terms of your
ability to access

149
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,680
what I would call
the algorithms that

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,040
enable us or open the
opportunity to experience

151
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,610
happiness.

152
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,650
Now before we begin
today's episode,

153
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,280
I'd like to talk about a very
specific tool that applies yes

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,320
to our pursuit of
happiness but actually

155
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,750
to our pursuit of everything,
including quality sleep

156
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,150
and ongoing
motivation, et cetera.

157
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,550
I've talked many, many
times before on this podcast

158
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,830
and on other podcasts,
and on social media

159
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,800
about the critical
value of getting

160
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,130
regular bright light, ideally
sunlight, in your eyes

161
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,540
within the first hour of waking.

162
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,630
Or if the sun isn't out when
you wake up in the morning,

163
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,490
to turn on a lot of
bright artificial lights

164
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,907
and then get
sunlight in your eyes

165
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:00,680
for anywhere from
5 to 20 minutes,

166
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,940
depending on how cloudy it is
in the early part of the day.

167
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,640
Absolutely outsized
effects mood and focus

168
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,430
during the day and
quality of sleep at night.

169
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,070
Now there's another
sort of central tenet

170
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,682
of getting great sleep
and improving mood

171
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:15,890
and focus throughout the day.

172
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,070
And that's to avoid
bright artificial light

173
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,750
exposure to your eyes between
the hours of about 10 PM

174
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,880
to 4:00 AM.

175
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,730
Now leaving shift workers aside,
and we have an entire episode

176
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,160
devoted to shift work, most
people are asleep at night

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,450
and awake during the day.

178
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,570
And you would be wise to
avoid exposure of your eyes

179
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,790
to bright artificial light
between the hours of 10:00

180
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,313
PM and 4:00 AM.

181
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:37,480
If you're going to use
screens or artificial lights,

182
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,890
dim them down as far as you can.

183
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,190
Now there are several studies
that point to the fact

184
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,923
that one of the major
issues with getting

185
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,090
bright light in your eyes
between the hours of 10:00

186
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,020
PM and 4:00 AM is that
it has a negative impact

187
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,900
on the so-called dopaminergic or
dopamine circuits of the brain

188
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,600
and body, which can
enhance depression.

189
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,050
That is lead to ongoing
lower mood and affect.

190
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,550
So that's a reason
to dim the lights

191
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,070
or avoid bright lights
between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.

192
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,670
However, I and many others
need to use artificial light

193
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,400
and screens sometimes, even
between the hours of 10:00

194
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,860
PM and midnight or even
midnight to 3:00 AM,

195
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,220
depending on what's going
on in my life or your life.

196
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,125
That may include you as well.

197
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,000
Now it turns out that
there are powerful ways

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,020
to offset some, not all, but
some of the negative effects

199
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,460
of viewing artificial lights
between the hours of 10:00

200
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,920
PM and 4:00 AM.

201
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
And one of the most
powerful ways to do that

202
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,810
is to simply adjust
the overall brightness

203
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,000
of your artificial
lighting throughout the day

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,320
and in the evening.

205
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,320
So one of the issues nowadays
that we're really facing

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,990
is that people are simply not
getting enough bright light

207
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,355
in their eyes from sunlight
or from other sources

208
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,980
during the daytime,
and they're getting

209
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,880
far too much bright
light in their eyes

210
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,820
largely from artificial sources,
of course, in the evening

211
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,540
and at night.

212
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,520
Not just from 10 PM
to 4:00 AM, but also

213
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,620
in the evening hours from 6 to
10 PM and so on and so forth.

214
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,130
So a very simple yet
powerful solution

215
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,340
that supported by peer-reviewed
research in humans

216
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,550
is to try and make your
indoor working and/or home

217
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,232
environment during the
day as bright as possible.

218
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,440
Now, if you can achieve that
through direct sunlight,

219
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,990
terrific.

220
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,800
If you can get outside a lot
during the daytime, terrific.

221
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,300
But many people simply cannot.

222
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,580
But most people do have some
windows in their environment.

223
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,370
I realize some don't
but, most people do.

224
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,050
And as a consequence,
most people

225
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,600
are using rather dim artificial
lighting indoors during the day

226
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,700
and then very bright
artificial lighting

227
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,262
indoors in the evening, and
at night, that's a problem.

228
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:34,970
And if you think about
it, logically, you

229
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,920
want to do the exact reverse.

230
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,020
So it's been shown
that if you simply

231
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,270
increase the amount of
bright artificial light

232
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,940
that you were exposed to
during the day, and remember

233
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,390
this is not an excuse to not get
your morning sunlight viewing,

234
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,668
but in addition to that, to make
your indoor artificial lights

235
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,460
very bright, bright,
bright, bright, bright

236
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,540
throughout the day.

237
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,250
And then much dimmer from the
hours of 6:00 PM until bedtime.

238
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,170
Or if you can't do
that, then maybe as soon

239
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,710
as you get home from about
8:00 PM until bedtime.

240
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,630
And then dim them way,
way down between 10:00

241
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,790
PM and 4:00 AM or off entirely.

242
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,130
That's going to be
a far better pattern

243
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,470
for your sleep-wake
cycles, focus, mood, et

244
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,730
cetera than what
most people do, which

245
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,730
is to have a few windows
in their indoor working

246
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,060
environment during the day and
keep the indoor lights rather

247
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,880
dim at a time when they
need more photons, more

248
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,480
light energy.

249
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,770
And then in the evening,
when they get home

250
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,605
because it's dark
outside, they tend

251
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:27,980
to turn the lights
much brighter.

252
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,660
You actually want
to do the reverse.

253
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,410
Now there's an even
simpler solution,

254
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,670
which is to get some bright
sunlight in your eyes

255
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,650
right around the time of sunset.

256
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,780
It doesn't have to
be exactly at sunset,

257
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,540
it could be in the late
afternoon and evening.

258
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,730
But it's been shown now
in studies on humans,

259
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,355
and I'll provide a
link to at least one

260
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:46,790
of those studies,
that by getting

261
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,000
some bright light in your
eyes, ideally from sunlight,

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,647
in the late afternoon
and evening.

263
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,230
And, of course, the timing will
vary depending on time of year

264
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,330
and where you are
located on the planet.

265
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,898
But facing the
sun around sunset,

266
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:01,940
you don't actually have
to see the sun cross down

267
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,530
below the horizon,
but facing the sun

268
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,950
around that time for anywhere
from 5 to 10 minutes or even

269
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,740
less, even two to
five minutes, can

270
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,510
adjust the
sensitivity of neurons

271
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,780
in your retina that communicate
light information to the brain

272
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,150
and make it such that in
the evening when you use

273
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,060
artificial lights, they
aren't going to have as much

274
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,580
of a detrimental effect
on your dopamine system

275
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,370
and for impairing your sleep.

276
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,882
So the idea is as much bright
light, ideally from sunlight

277
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:29,840
but also from artificial
sources, from the time

278
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,360
you wake up in the
morning until the evening.

279
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,712
Maybe around 6:00 or 7:00.

280
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:35,670
Maybe in the summer
months, a little bit later.

281
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,660
And then really try and
get as little bright light

282
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,950
in your eyes as you can in the
evening and nighttime hours.

283
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,750
And ideally, you would also get
some sunlight exposure right

284
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,970
around the time of sunset
or in the late afternoon.

285
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,860
Go outside, take
your sunglasses off.

286
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,590
Don't try and do this through a
windshield or through a window.

287
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,860
It will not work.

288
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,188
You have to get outside.

289
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,730
If you're under an
overhang, at least

290
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,350
try and get some direct sunlight
in your eyes at that time.

291
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,440
And that will adjust
the sensitivity

292
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,200
of your retina such that
bright artificial lights

293
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,240
or artificial lights
of any kind that you're

294
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,210
exposed to in the evening and
in the late hours of the night

295
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,130
won't have as much of
a detrimental effect.

296
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,630
That said, if you
go to the bathroom

297
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,053
in the middle of the night,
try and keep the lights dim.

298
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,220
Many people have asked
whether or not, for instance,

299
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,000
a nightlight or a flashlight
is going to have as much

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,930
of a negative effect.

301
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,140
This is very straightforward.

302
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,710
If you think about it, if you
shine a light at something,

303
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,450
you can see into
your environment.

304
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,500
If you've ever been
camping or you've

305
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,810
walked with a flashlight,
you can see things around you

306
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,370
that you wouldn't
otherwise, of course.

307
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,150
But if you were to shine
that light in your eyes,

308
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,192
it would be far brighter.

309
00:12:37,192 --> 00:12:39,860
So yes, of course, if you get
up in the middle of the night

310
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,200
and you can use your phone
flashlight to illuminate

311
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,820
the environment that you're
in so that you can safely

312
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
go to where you need to
go and then back to bed,

313
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,650
that's going to be far better
than turning on the lights

314
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,170
or, of course, shining
light in your eyes, right.

315
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,140
So the idea is bright,
bright, bright in the morning

316
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,200
and throughout the day.

317
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,130
And as dim and dark
as possible at night.

318
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,680
And that afternoon light
viewing provides, sort of,

319
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,560
what I call a Netflix
inoculation that

320
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,965
will allow you to adjust
your retinal sensitivity

321
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:08,090
and give you a little bit
more flexibility in terms

322
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,370
of allowing some
nighttime light exposure

323
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,960
without the detrimental effects.

324
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,820
Now I realize today's
episode is about happiness,

325
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,450
it's not about
sunlight or dopamine.

326
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,940
And yet, as we'll
talk about more

327
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,280
in just a moment, if you're
not optimizing your sleep

328
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,410
and if you are using or
being exposed to light rather

329
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,260
at the wrong times of
the day/night cycle,

330
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,200
that is going to make it
very hard for the other sorts

331
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,270
of practices that
relate to happiness

332
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,690
to have their full impact.

333
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,890
So the backdrop, where I would
say the kind of landscape

334
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,080
of your chemicals
and your hormones,

335
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,970
is powerfully controlled by not
just the brightness of light

336
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,690
but the timing of light
and your exposure to light.

337
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,390
In particular, your exposure
to light to your eyes

338
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,790
is something that you have
a lot of control over.

339
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,610
You don't have absolute control,
but you have a lot of control

340
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,280
over.

341
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,940
And it's been proven that
even these small steps, which

342
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,003
are completely cost-free.

343
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,670
They require just a
few minutes of time,

344
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,520
but no purchase a
product or anything else

345
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,060
can allow you to greatly
adjust your neurochemistry

346
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,320
and your hormones in the
direction of better mood,

347
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,300
better sleep, and happiness.

348
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,132
Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize

349
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,590
that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research

350
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,790
roles at Stanford.

351
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,830
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

352
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,290
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

353
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,960
and science-related tools
for the general public.

354
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,460
In keeping with
that theme, I'd like

355
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,870
to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.

356
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,000
Our first sponsor is Thesis.

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,220
Thesis makes custom nootropics.

358
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,040
And as I've said many times
before on this podcast,

359
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,320
I am not a fan of
the word nootropics

360
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
because it means smart drugs.

361
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,910
And frankly, there are no
specific neural circuits

362
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,910
in the brain or body for
being quote-unquote smart.

363
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,890
Thesis understands
this, and they've

364
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,127
developed custom nootropics
that are designed

365
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:54,210
to bring your brain and
body into the state that's

366
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,892
ideal for what you
need to accomplish.

367
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,600
They use the highest
quality ingredients,

368
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,085
things like
phosphatidylserine, alpha GPC,

369
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,460
many ingredients
that I've talked

370
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,610
about before on this podcast
and that I happen to use myself.

371
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,470
I've been using Thesis
for over a year now,

372
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,637
and I can confidently say
that their nootropics have

373
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,740
been a game changer.

374
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,710
For me, I like their
nootropic for clarity.

375
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,930
I used that before
cognitive work often.

376
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,067
And I like their
nootropic for energy.

377
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,650
And I often used
that before workouts.

378
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,985
In particular, workouts
that are especially intense.

379
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:25,110
To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,

380
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,690
go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.

381
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,160
Take their 3-minute
quiz, and these

382
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,750
will send you four
different formulas

383
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,980
to try in your first month.

384
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,800
Again that's
takethesis.com/huberman.

385
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,510
And use the code
Huberman at checkout

386
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,580
to get 10% off your first box.

387
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,550
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

388
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,250
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

389
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,800
that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA

390
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,570
to help me better
understand your body

391
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,500
and help you meet
your health goals.

392
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,220
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

393
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,830
for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact

394
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,330
your immediate and
long-term health

395
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,712
can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.

396
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,920
One of the problems with a
lot of blood tests and DNA

397
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,710
tests out there, however,
is that you get information

398
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,380
back about lipids and
levels of hormones

399
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,323
and levels of metabolic
factors and so on,

400
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:11,490
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

401
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,940
InsideTracker has a very
easy-to-use online site where

402
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,650
you can monitor your levels.

403
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,740
And you can click on
any specific marker,

404
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,140
any specific hormone,
or metabolic factor,

405
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,350
and it will tell you the
behavioral tools, for instance,

406
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,993
exercise, the nutrition tools,
and the supplementation-based

407
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:30,660
tools that you can
use in order to bring

408
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,700
those numbers into
the appropriate ranges

409
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,010
for your immediate and
long-term health goals.

410
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,540
If you'd like to
try InsideTracker,

411
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,240
you can visit

to get 20% off any of
InsideTracker's plan.

413
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,790
Again that's
insidetracker.com/huberman

414
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,170
to get 20% off.

415
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,870
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

416
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,610
Helix makes
mattresses and pillows

417
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,530
that are of the absolute
highest quality.

418
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,350
I started sleeping on a Helix
mattress well over a year ago,

419
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,900
and it's been the best
sleep that I've ever had.

420
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,450
One of the things that makes
Helix mattresses so unique

421
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,400
is that they match the
design of the mattress

422
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,710
to your unique sleep needs.

423
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,710
So, for instance, if you
go on to their website,

424
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,792
you can take a brief quiz.

425
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,759
It's only takes about
two or three minutes.

426
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,930
And you'll answer
questions like do

427
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,940
you tend to run hot or
cold throughout the night.

428
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,107
Or whether or not you sleep
on your back, your side,

429
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:15,930
or your stomach, or
maybe you don't know.

430
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,960
Regardless, they will match you
to the custom mattress that's

431
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,368
ideal for your sleep needs.

432
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:22,919
For me that was the
dusk D-U-S-K mattress.

433
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Which, for me, was not
too firm, not too soft,

434
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,270
and was ideal for
my sleep patterns.

435
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,890
You take the quiz,
and you'll find out

436
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,180
what mattress is ideal
for your sleep patterns.

437
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,305
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

438
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:36,232
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
take their brief sleep quiz,

439
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:38,190
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

440
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,250
And you'll get up to $200 off
any mattress order and two

441
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,150
free pillows.

442
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,480
They have a 10-year warranty.

443
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,938
And you get to try
out the mattress

444
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,195
for 100 nights risk-free.

445
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,820
Again, if you're
interested, you can go

446
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,900
to helixsleep.com/huberman for
up to $200 off and two free

447
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,440
pillows.

448
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,910
Let's talk about happiness.

449
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,390
This thing that everybody seems
to want, and yet not everybody

450
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,530
can agree on what exactly
it is or how to get it.

451
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,570
Now I want to start by quoting
a previous guest on the Huberman

452
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,710
Lab podcast.

453
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,500
And that is a colleague of mine
at Stanford School of Medicine,

454
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,720
Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who's both
a bioengineer and a clinician.

455
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,110
That is, he's a psychiatrist
who spends a lot of his time

456
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,380
both running a laboratory
and seeing patients,

457
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,790
human patients, of course.

458
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,010
And I once was at
a meeting where

459
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,880
I heard Karl say something
to the extent of we

460
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,873
don't know what
other people feel.

461
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:33,540
In fact, most of the
time, we don't even

462
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,220
really know how we feel.

463
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,320
And while that
statement was meant

464
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,900
to report several different
things about the way

465
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
that the brain
works and emotions,

466
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,412
et cetera, one of the things
that he was emphasizing,

467
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,620
and I know he was emphasizing
it because he confirmed

468
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,170
this for me, was the
fact that language.

469
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,950
Things like the word
happiness, or joy, or meaning,

470
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,460
or pleasure, or delight,
are actually not

471
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,610
very precise when it comes to
describing our brain and body

472
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,370
states.

473
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,200
So, for instance, if I tell
you I'm feeling pretty happy.

474
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,400
I know what that means for
me, at least in this moment,

475
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,290
but you don't really
know whether or not

476
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,860
it means the same thing as what
pretty happy means for you.

477
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,190
If I say I'm extremely
happy and I have a big grin.

478
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,100
I have a grin on my face that I
can't seem to wipe off my face.

479
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,340
Well, then, you might get a
sense of how much happier I

480
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,540
am than pretty happy.

481
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,160
But it's still hard to calibrate
my level of internal state

482
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,230
or happiness, and the
same is true for you

483
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,550
and for everybody else.

484
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,590
And it's important for
us to acknowledge this

485
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,850
because at this point
in human history, 2022,

486
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,670
we don't really
have a measurement

487
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,640
like body temperature or
heart rate or heart rate

488
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,330
variability or even a way
to measure neurochemicals

489
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,060
in the brain and body
that give us anything

490
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,350
better than a crude correlate
or an estimate, at best,

491
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,150
of what happiness is.

492
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,660
So that's really important to
understand and to keep in mind

493
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
throughout this episode.

494
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,910
It doesn't mean that we cannot
have a strong data-driven

495
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,398
conversation about happiness
and what brings us to a state

496
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:11,940
of happiness.

497
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,360
But it's very important to
understand that language is not

498
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,780
an ideal and maybe even
a deficient tool in terms

499
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,380
of describing our emotions and
our states of mind and body.

500
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,990
Now equally important
is to understand

501
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,930
that while we do have
neurotransmitters,

502
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,660
that is, the chemicals
that are released between

503
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,730
neurons, nerve cells
that allow neurons

504
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,360
to communicate, things
like glutamate and gaba,

505
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,380
for instance.

506
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,780
And we have what are
called modulators.

507
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,400
These are chemicals
also released

508
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,020
by neurons that impact the
electrical firing and chemical

509
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,100
release of other neurons.

510
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,510
Things like serotonin, and
dopamine, and acetylcholine,

511
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,950
and epinephrine.

512
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,800
Neuromodulators and
neurotransmitters

513
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,120
are always present in a
cocktail in our brain and body.

514
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,430
That is, they are present
in different ratios

515
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,670
and at different levels.

516
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,000
So we need to completely
discard with the idea

517
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,290
that any one neurotransmitter
or any one neuromodulator

518
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,920
is solely responsible
for a state of happiness

519
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,620
or for a lack of state of
happiness, for that matter.

520
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,340
That said, it is true
that for people that

521
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,640
tend to have lower baseline
levels of, for instance,

522
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,880
dopamine, their
levels of happiness,

523
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,740
or we should say their
self-reported levels

524
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,890
of happiness, tend to
be lower than for those

525
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,340
that have greatly elevated
baseline levels of dopamine.

526
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,350
Now, this can be
best appreciated

527
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,440
at the extremes
where, for instance,

528
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,690
in conditions like
Parkinson's disease

529
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,330
or other conditions where
people's levels of dopamine

530
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,460
in their brain is
severely depleted.

531
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,760
Mind you, we also see this
in drug-addicted individuals

532
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,310
that are in a withdrawal state
because they're trying to quit

533
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,680
or they don't have access to the
drug that normally stimulates

534
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,513
release of dopamine.

535
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:01,280
Think the cocaine addict
who can't get cocaine.

536
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
Or the methamphetamine
addict that

537
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,670
can't or is trying to avoid
taking methamphetamine.

538
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,640
Or the Parkinson's patient
who has fewer dopamine

539
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,620
neurons because
they degenerated.

540
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,440
Those individuals do tend
to be more depressed.

541
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,880
They tend to have lower affect.

542
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,500
They are less happy.

543
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,860
At least, that's how they report
themselves to be emotionally.

544
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,590
And that's what we observe when
we look at them behaviorally

545
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,710
in terms of the amount of
smiling, the amount of energy

546
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,240
they seem to have.

547
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,010
At the opposite extreme.

548
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,160
And while still focusing
on the kind of pathology

549
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,530
of neurotransmitter and
neuromodulator systems,

550
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,910
an individual who is in
a manic phase of bipolar

551
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,300
will tend to have very
elevated levels of dopamine.

552
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,100
And those people will
talk a mile a minute,

553
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,360
and they won't require sleep.

554
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,458
And at least to them, every
idea is an exciting idea and one

555
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:50,500
that they want to pursue.

556
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,790
We did an entire episode about
bipolar depression, A.K.A.

557
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,498
Bipolar disorder.

558
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:57,540
So if you'd like to learn
more about that, please

559
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,690
check out that episode.

560
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,680
That and all other
episodes of the podcast,

561
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,790
of course, you can find it
hubermanlab.com in all formats.

562
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,520
But the point here is
that very low levels

563
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,640
are very high levels of
dopamine are correlated

564
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,720
with certain states of,
for instance, low happiness

565
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,722
or the absence of happiness.

566
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:17,680
We could even call it
depression in some cases.

567
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,500
Or extreme happiness
or even euphoria.

568
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,150
Sometimes even
inappropriate euphoria,

569
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,300
as is the case with
bipolar depression

570
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,570
or sometimes called bipolar
mania or bipolar disorder.

571
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,610
Now, of course, there's a range
in between depressed and manic.

572
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,670
And most people, fortunately
reside somewhere in that range.

573
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,350
And it is indeed a continuum.

574
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,070
And I think it's safe to
say that levels of dopamine

575
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,260
probably do correlate
with levels of happiness.

576
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,320
But there is no
one single chemical

577
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,920
nor chemical signature, that is,
no specific recipe of two parts

578
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,290
dopamine, to one part
serotonin, to one part

579
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,580
acetylcholine that we can
say equates to happiness.

580
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,410
Indeed there's now
tremendous controversy

581
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,540
as to whether or not,
for instance, having

582
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,060
lower levels of
serotonin is actually

583
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,242
the cause of depression
or merely correlates

584
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,200
with depression or maybe
doesn't even correlate

585
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
with depression, at all.

586
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,780
This became especially
controversial

587
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,450
because, in the last year,
the so-called serotonin

588
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,510
hypothesis of depression has
been called into question.

589
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,260
And indeed, it does seem to be
the case that for individuals

590
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,810
that are depressed,
their levels of serotonin

591
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,650
can sometimes be normal.

592
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,440
However, and this is
an important however,

593
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,620
that does not mean that
administering drugs

594
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,110
that increase levels of
serotonin in depressed people

595
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,050
does not sometimes
and indeed often help

596
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,515
ameliorate some
of their symptoms.

597
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,890
And I should mention that many
of the selective serotonin

598
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,890
reuptake inhibitors.

599
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,940
So-called SSRIs such
as Prozac and Zoloft,

600
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,910
et cetera, are still
considered excellent treatments

601
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,950
for conditions like OCD
and so on and so forth.

602
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,410
But what I'm trying to do is
make two important points.

603
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,650
First of all, that language
is not a great indicator

604
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,890
of internal state.

605
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,465
Especially when trying to
understand other people's

606
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:05,090
internal state.

607
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,210
And that is especially true
for things like happiness.

608
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,670
And that there is
no one chemical

609
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,610
signature of happiness.

610
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,910
There's no one neural
modulator or combinations

611
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,560
of neuromodulators
that we can say

612
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,690
is the cocktail for happiness.

613
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,140
But, and it's a very
important, but when

614
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,570
levels of dopamine
and serotonin tend

615
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,420
to be chronically
low for an individual

616
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,790
below their typical
baseline, they

617
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,520
will, yes, tend to
be lower in affect

618
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,800
and have lower mood and less
episodes of happiness per day,

619
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,380
per week, per month,
per year, et cetera.

620
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,470
Conversely, when an
individual has elevations

621
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,910
in dopamine and
serotonin levels,

622
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,550
in particular dopamine levels
and the other so-called

623
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,770
catecholamines, which include
epinephrine and norepinephrine.

624
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,940
So the catecholamines are
dopamine, epinephrine,

625
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,870
and norepinephrine.

626
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,580
They're all very
similar biochemically.

627
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,600
They all lead to states of
elevated motivation, energy,

628
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,920
and so on.

629
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,830
When those chemicals are
elevated above baseline,

630
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,400
people do tend to have elevated
sense of mood and well-being,

631
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,860
and in particular
sense of possibility

632
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,780
about what they
can do in the world

633
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,950
and what the world
can offer them.

634
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,790
So we need to acknowledge
those two features of language

635
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,120
and neurochemistry as we
wade into the discussion

636
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,580
about the psychology
of happiness.

637
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,910
And, in particular, about
the controlled experiments

638
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,550
that have been done in
excellent laboratories focused

639
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,460
on the psychology of happiness
and what brings happiness

640
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,510
and what does not.

641
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,010
There have been some excellent
studies on happiness.

642
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,850
And these come in
two forms generally.

643
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,150
One form of these
studies is individuals

644
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,320
come into a laboratory.

645
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,630
They participate in an
experiment over the course

646
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,130
of a day or months.

647
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,540
And then, data are
collected analyzed,

648
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,430
and the papers are submitted,
and published, and discussed.

649
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,040
The other form is so-called
longitudinal study.

650
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,050
Where individuals come
into the laboratory,

651
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,930
and they are studied over
a very long period of time.

652
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:06,980
Ranging from months to years
and sometimes even decades.

653
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,260
And then, the variables of
age, life circumstances,

654
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,590
and other factors can be
incorporated into the data.

655
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,070
And typically, there
are multiple papers,

656
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,340
there's data published
throughout the longitudinal

657
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,050
study, or sometimes
it's just one paper

658
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,510
at the end of the
longitudinal study.

659
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,330
Let's talk about one of
the more famous and perhaps

660
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,200
the longest-running
longitudinal study on happiness.

661
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,410
This is a study that was
initiated or conceived

662
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,870
in 1938 at Harvard University.

663
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,910
The so-called Harvard
Happiness Project.

664
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,660
Some of you probably
heard about this.

665
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,860
It involved Harvard
College sophomores

666
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,400
and other individuals who were
incorporated into this study

667
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,720
as well.

668
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,230
It's a study that initially
had more than a couple

669
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,820
of hundred subjects.

670
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,880
But because some have
either dropped out and not

671
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,660
been able to be contacted and
monitored over time or died,

672
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,390
or for whatever reason,
are no longer participating

673
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,220
in the study, they're very
few of these individuals left.

674
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,557
And yet there's tremendous
power to a study like this.

675
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:12,890
It's such an impressive study,
and we're all so grateful

676
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,960
that laboratories
at Harvard decided

677
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,560
to initiate and continue
this study because it

678
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,290
is one of the few studies,
perhaps the study that

679
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,010
has allowed us to understand
happiness in our species

680
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,410
over a very long period of time.

681
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,910
Like any study,
it's not perfect.

682
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,600
It didn't include a
lot of matching by sex

683
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,370
or matching by
vocation, or matching

684
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,780
by income and background.

685
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,420
And back then, there was
also a lot less discussion

686
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,560
about trauma and
histories around trauma,

687
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,890
as well as positive
episodes in people's lives.

688
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,580
Nonetheless, there's a lot of
power in a study like this.

689
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,863
And there are some
very basic takeaways,

690
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:51,530
some of which you may have heard
before but some of which may be

691
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,780
surprising those
of you who haven't.

692
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,680
So one of the key
things about the study

693
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,830
is people in the
study, at least those

694
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,950
who still have intact memory,
which many of them do,

695
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,680
are able to think
back on not just

696
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,370
their previous year or week but
10 years ago, 20 years ago, 50

697
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,700
years ago and compare
what makes them happy

698
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,860
at one age versus another age.

699
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,480
A number of things have
emerged from that conversation.

700
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,798
So I just want to discuss
some of the highlight points

701
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:22,340
then we'll get into
a little bit more

702
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,910
of the nitty-gritty of the data.

703
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,050
First of all, it's been
discussed many, many times

704
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,670
that the total amount of
income that an individual makes

705
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,550
or has, and again, this
could be income from work,

706
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,280
or it could be money
that they inherited,

707
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,330
does not seem to directly relate
to their level of happiness.

708
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,980
Now a lot of people take
that point and think,

709
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,720
oh, money doesn't matter.

710
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,500
Other people hear that point
and think to themselves,

711
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,528
yeah, right, easy to say
if you have a lot of money.

712
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:56,570
We'll talk about the
interpretation of those data

713
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,080
in just a few minutes.

714
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,830
But I do want to
earmark that finding.

715
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:07,760
Because I agree that while
money or total resources itself

716
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,690
does not predict happiness
in any kind of direct way,

717
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,400
that is not the
same thing as saying

718
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,550
having very few resources will
make you happier, of course.

719
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,530
I don't think anyone
would imagine that.

720
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,340
But it also tends to overlook
an important point, which

721
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,710
is something that I certainly
have learned to appreciate

722
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,650
in my life and something
that I especially appreciated

723
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,482
when I was a student
and post-doc, which

724
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:31,190
is the following.

725
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,530
People will say money
can't buy happiness.

726
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,870
And we'll talk about the buy
aspect of that in a moment.

727
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,150
And indeed, that's true.

728
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,682
If you look at this
longitudinal study or you

729
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:42,140
look at other
studies that are done

730
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,270
on a more short-term basis.

731
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,820
Once people get past a
certain level of income

732
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,000
relative to their cost of
living, the amount of happiness

733
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,620
does not scale with that income.

734
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,800
That is, for every
additional $1,000 or $10,000

735
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,330
that they earn,
they don't report

736
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,270
being that much happier
on a daily basis.

737
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:06,660
Now that said, I venture the
argument that while money truly

738
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,890
cannot buy happiness, it
absolutely can buffer stress.

739
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,750
And in particular,
it can buffer stress

740
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,110
in the form of the
ability to purchase or pay

741
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,340
for goods and services,
and in particular services.

742
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,210
You're not going to tell
me that having children

743
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,340
doesn't involve some
increase in the demands

744
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,350
on your life, less
sleep, and more demands.

745
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,360
And it certainly is
the case that if you

746
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,740
can hire help to clean.

747
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,550
You can hire nannies
if that's your thing.

748
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,280
You can hire help to assist
with babysitting or even night

749
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,070
nurses if you're having trouble
sleeping that will literally

750
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,350
allow you to sleep while
they take care of your child

751
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,770
in the middle of the night.

752
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,290
Often give excellent care.

753
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,550
One hopes excellent care.

754
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,500
That that won't offset
some of the stress

755
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,970
associated with lack of sleep.

756
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,290
So there are a million
different examples

757
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,340
one could give of this, but
I certainly experienced this

758
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
during graduate school.

759
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,820
In fact, I experience both
sides of the equation here.

760
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,470
I made very little money
as a graduate student.

761
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,340
I had essentially no savings
when I started graduate school,

762
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,570
and I made very little money.

763
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,237
The amount doesn't
matter at this point,

764
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:10,950
but I could just barely
afford rent and my food.

765
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,950
I actually opted to live in the
laboratory a lot of the time.

766
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,255
And by doing that,
I had more money

767
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:19,380
to spend on other things
that were important to me.

768
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,640
Now I did not have a
family at the time,

769
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,220
and so I was able to do that.

770
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,750
Something that not
everyone can do.

771
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,440
But I made very little
money, but at the same time,

772
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,010
I was in laboratory
all the time,

773
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,630
and that's where I wanted to be.

774
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,450
And so my level of
stress was actually

775
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,010
pretty low because
I was investing

776
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,110
all my time and energy
into the very thing

777
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,420
that I knew would eventually
help bring me more resources.

778
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,360
When I moved from being a
graduate student to a postdoc,

779
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,350
for instance.

780
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,720
A postdoc is generally a
three to five-year period.

781
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,570
It's sort of like
residency in medicine,

782
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,890
where you're no
longer taking courses,

783
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,240
but you continue to do research.

784
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,700
In fact, entire new
lines of research

785
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
and prior to getting
a professorship.

786
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:03,770
My income went up slightly,
went up by about 30% to 40%.

787
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,880
But because of where I moved
and because of the times,

788
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,790
my cost of living went way,
way up and I was extremely

789
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,790
stressed.

790
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,870
So it wasn't my
absolute income, it

791
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,290
was my absolute income
relative to my cost of living.

792
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,330
The other thing that
one needs to consider

793
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,410
when considering income versus
cost of living is there's

794
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,702
also this notion of peer group.

795
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:27,660
And we're going to talk
more about social bonds

796
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,675
and connections later.

797
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,050
But one thing that
I noticed when

798
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,180
I moved from being a
graduate student to a postdoc

799
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,950
was I was a graduate student in
a small town where I had access

800
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,280
if I chose to participate
in most, if not all,

801
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,280
of the social gatherings because
they were all very low cost.

802
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,470
People tended to aggregate
at the farmer's market

803
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:45,975
on Saturday.

804
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:48,350
Most people wouldn't even
purchase anything, at least not

805
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,060
the graduate students
wouldn't purchase anything.

806
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,435
It was just a
place to aggregate.

807
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:53,360
People sometimes play
pickup games of soccer

808
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,580
or just hang out
have a cup of coffee.

809
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,560
There was a volleyball
game on Fridays.

810
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,030
Sometimes people would go
out to eat that evening,

811
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,180
which of course, costs
money, et cetera,

812
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,950
but it was relatively
low cost of living.

813
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,120
And social connections and
peer group interactions

814
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,270
were all generated around
the same fairly low-cost

815
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,260
activities.

816
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,550
When I transitioned to being
a postdoc, I made more money,

817
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,710
but cost of living went up.

818
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,380
But in addition to
that, my peer group

819
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,980
tended to want to engage in
the same kinds of activities

820
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,250
that people in that larger
city were engaged in.

821
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,489
So peer group has a tremendously
powerful influence on

822
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,100
whether or not we gauge
the amount of money

823
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,637
that we have as bringing
us happiness or not.

824
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:39,679
And that really speaks to
the critical importance

825
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,139
of social interactions
and certain kinds

826
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,188
of social interactions,
in particular.

827
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:46,730
Now, if any of that was unclear,
what I'm basically saying is

828
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,070
it's not just about being
able to pay your rent.

829
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,440
It's also about
being able to access

830
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,239
the kinds of social interactions
that you deem are quote-unquote

831
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,760
correct for you at
that stage of life

832
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,860
and in the place where
you happen to be living.

833
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,880
Because if you can meet all
the demands of costs of rent

834
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,610
and paying your power
bill and food, et cetera,

835
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,580
but you are socially
isolated because your peer

836
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,880
group, or those around you
that you want to engage with,

837
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,600
are engaging in activities that
you either don't have time for,

838
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,940
literally, because
you're doing other things

839
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,150
or that you don't have the
financial resources for,

840
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,530
then that can actually
severely impact this rating

841
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,360
of what we call happiness.

842
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,070
Why am I parsing
this so finally?

843
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,740
Well, I'm parsing and finally
because I think that most of us

844
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,950
have heard the outcome of
this study from Harvard

845
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,072
or the more short-term
studies, also many of which

846
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:41,780
are from Harvard.

847
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,550
We'll talk about the
just phenomenal work

848
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,092
from Dan Gilbert's laboratory
and other laboratories who have

849
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:47,480
focused on issues like these.

850
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,100
And I certainly don't
want to take anything away

851
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,892
from those results.

852
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:51,950
They're very powerful
and important results

853
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,870
that really point over
and over to the fact

854
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,990
that people's happiness does not
necessarily scale with income.

855
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,610
In fact, it tends not
to past a certain level,

856
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,173
and yet I think
we'd be remiss, I

857
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:05,840
think actually it
would be inappropriate

858
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,870
for me to say that the amount
of income that one makes

859
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,890
is not important.

860
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,430
Because if the amount of
money that you happen to have

861
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,880
or are making does
not allow you to meet

862
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,560
your basic needs of shelter,
health care, et cetera.

863
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,810
And/or doesn't
allow you to access

864
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,310
the kind of social interactions
that can renew and reset

865
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,620
or, I would say,
directly enhance

866
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,020
the kind of neurotransmitter
systems and hormones

867
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,780
that lead us to feel that
we are happy in our life

868
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,870
and we're having quality
social connections, well then

869
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,057
that's very stressful.

870
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:42,390
And this brings me back to
the statement I made earlier,

871
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,390
which is, indeed, money
cannot buy happiness,

872
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,520
but it certainly
can buffer stress.

873
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,400
And one of the ways
that it buffers stress

874
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,160
is by allowing options
of different kinds

875
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,690
of social interactions.

876
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,630
Options of different
types of recreation

877
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,200
that one can engage in to access
new forms of social interaction

878
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,590
and so on and so on.

879
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,435
So we need to be a little bit
careful or at least nuanced

880
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,560
about this statement that
money can't buy happiness

881
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,477
and that the data support
the fact that wealth

882
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:10,190
doesn't determine happiness.

883
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,440
I think there is a truth
to that but there's

884
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,130
another side to that, I think
is less often acknowledged

885
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,833
and that certainly
I've experienced

886
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,000
and that I think many of
you out there have probably

887
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,240
experienced as well.

888
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,390
One other major finding of
the Harvard longitudinal

889
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,210
study on happiness, as well
as shorter-term studies

890
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,270
on happiness, is
that much as you've

891
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,630
heard, perhaps that no
one on their deathbed

892
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,050
says they wish they had
worked more, well indeed,

893
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,510
the total amount of time
that one spends working

894
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,360
does not seem to
determine one's happiness.

895
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,800
And yet I also want to earmark
that result as one that we need

896
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,840
to parse a bit more carefully.

897
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,080
Because work, last
time I checked

898
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,540
and certainly for me,
is the way typically

899
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,020
that people earn an income.

900
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,380
And as we just talked
about a moment ago,

901
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,890
income is often a way
that people have access

902
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,590
to or provide access
for their family

903
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,920
to things like
recreation that opens up

904
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,560
the opportunity for more
social connection, right.

905
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,890
So we have to be careful with
how we interpret these blanket

906
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,220
statements that have become
very popular that money doesn't

907
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,190
determine happiness and that
the amount that you work

908
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,350
isn't going to
determine happiness.

909
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,650
It certainly is the case
that if you earn more money

910
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,370
from working more and
that money is devoted

911
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,170
to things that bring
more opportunities

912
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,630
for social connection
or for buffering stress

913
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,890
in other areas of your
life, including health care,

914
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,640
care for your children,
care for yourself,

915
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,210
recreation, other things
that you enjoy, well then

916
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,680
I think it's a little bit naive
to assume that work itself is

917
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,210
somehow counter to happiness.

918
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,910
Which, of course, it isn't.

919
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,710
And it especially isn't if we
combine that feature of work

920
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,500
with another important feature
of the human psyche, which

921
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,130
is this notion of meaning.

922
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,600
Now in the
not-too-distant future,

923
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,470
we will do an episode of
this podcast on meaning

924
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,080
and what constitutes meaning
in a given endeavor, work

925
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,220
or otherwise.

926
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,780
But much of the psychology of
the last century, and still

927
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,360
today, focuses on this
feature of meaning

928
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,690
as a critical one in terms
of what makes us happy

929
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,480
and what doesn't make us happy,
certainly in the long term.

930
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,240
And I can certainly
say for myself

931
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,300
that learning and teaching, and
doing research in my laboratory

932
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,190
brings me tremendous feeling
of meaning and happiness.

933
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,680
Some people consider
their work simply

934
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,230
a way to gain a paycheck,
and other people

935
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,890
find that they would do the
very work they do regardless of

936
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,140
whether or not they were paid.

937
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,680
In fact, many people will do
volunteer work and other forms

938
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,670
of work for zero money.

939
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,240
So this idea that
money isn't important

940
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,020
or that work is not as
important as we deem it to be,

941
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,360
that also needs to be
considered from a number

942
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,600
of different perspectives.

943
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,150
And again, by no
means am I trying

944
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,670
to undermine the data of
these impressive studies, both

945
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,410
the longitudinal and
short-term studies,

946
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,770
but I think we do have to be
cautious in our discussion

947
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,340
of results like these
because the internet is

948
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:13,080
replete with conversations
about the big factors that

949
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,980
determine happiness.

950
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,350
It's going to be social
connection, not income.

951
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,140
It's going to be
the amount of time

952
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,370
that you are able to have open
thinking and creativity, which

953
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,770
I think is an essential feature
of happiness, by the way.

954
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,180
Physical health.

955
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,050
In particular, one's
ability to stay mobile

956
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,870
and to be able to access
the kind of daily activities

957
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,450
that one needs to
accomplish unassisted

958
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,110
is a strong correlate of
happiness and so on and so on.

959
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,130
And, of course, there are
the basic physiology factors.

960
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,010
The things that feed back
onto our overall feelings

961
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,700
of well-being.

962
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,560
And I've talked
about these before,

963
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,780
and we'll just put these
quickly into a bin.

964
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,970
You can think of this
as a toolkit of things

965
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,820
that you and everyone really
should be constantly trying

966
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,450
to access, if not optimize, on
a regular basis because they

967
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,160
raise the tide or
what I would call

968
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,623
the buoyancy of
your overall system,

969
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:05,790
meaning your brain and body.

970
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,480
And that would be getting
sufficient deep sleep at least

971
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,010
80% of the nights of your life.

972
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,350
And ideally, the remaining
20% you're not getting deep

973
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,340
sleep or as much of it
because of positive events.

974
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,170
Quality nutrition.

975
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,760
Quality social interactions.

976
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,602
And we will define that
a little bit better.

977
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:24,810
In fact, we will define that
in a lot of detail later

978
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,940
in this episode and
actually how to get better

979
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,830
at creating quality
social interactions,

980
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,840
even very brief
social interactions.

981
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,190
So we have sleep,
we have nutrition,

982
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,810
we have social interactions.

983
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,730
We have purposeful
work, whether or not

984
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,650
it's paid work or non-paid work.

985
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,980
And, of course, there
are things like exercise

986
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,070
and maybe relationships to
pets and things of that sort.

987
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,060
And there are a
few others as well.

988
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,660
All of those are known to
increase your overall state

989
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,120
of well-being, that
puts you in a position

990
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,910
to access more meaning
and happiness, et cetera.

991
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,980
But for most
people, I think it's

992
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,200
fair to say that
earning a living.

993
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,490
And earning a living by working
is the typical way in which

994
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,120
we spend most of our time.

995
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,480
So I think we need to
put a special bracket

996
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,560
around those activities.

997
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,602
And it's something we will
return to a little bit

998
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:15,450
later in terms of trying to
understand how periods of life

999
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,200
in which there are big
or extensive work demands

1000
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,450
or extensive family
demands on us

1001
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,030
are indeed compatible
with states of happiness

1002
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:27,090
or frequent states of happiness
and how better to access those.

1003
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,270
Rather than simply say
money isn't important

1004
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,952
or the amount of time at
work really isn't important.

1005
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:35,160
That's not what people are
going to pay attention to.

1006
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,770
In fact, I don't know how
I will feel on my deathbed.

1007
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,180
How could I?

1008
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,730
Human beings are pretty
good about understanding

1009
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,050
how they feel in the present.

1010
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,320
If not describing it, they
are pretty good at feeling it

1011
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,200
if they have any sense
of internal state.

1012
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,280
That is interception.

1013
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,430
And you could have some idea
of how you feel in a moment.

1014
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,180
We're pretty good about
describing our past feelings,

1015
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,270
at least in broad
contour, but we are not

1016
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,890
very good at projecting how
we will feel in the future.

1017
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,307
And in fact, that's
a theme that's

1018
00:43:04,307 --> 00:43:06,540
going to come up
again and again today.

1019
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,580
Nonetheless, what we do know on
the basis of really solid data

1020
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,700
are that certain aspects
of our well-being

1021
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,040
tend to change
across our lifespan.

1022
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,130
Now lifespan is
something that we

1023
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,830
need to consider from
also a bit of nuance

1024
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,870
because humans are indeed
living longer and longer.

1025
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,840
And if we look at
the data on happiness

1026
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,430
across the lifespan dated maybe
30 or 40 years back or even

1027
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,790
20 years ago, it is
consistently described

1028
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,640
in that literature as a
so-called u-shaped function.

1029
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,090
Where people in their 20s
report being very, very happy,

1030
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,210
but as time goes on and they
acquire more responsibility.

1031
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,150
So typically, getting
married and having

1032
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,920
children in their mid to late
20s and 30s and into their 40s.

1033
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,020
Having more work
demands, et cetera,

1034
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,370
happiness tends to be
rated lower and lower,

1035
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,830
at least in those
previous studies.

1036
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:05,790
And then happiness tended
to increase as people

1037
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,500
approach their 50s and 60s.

1038
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,653
And they tended to retire,
and their work demands

1039
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:11,070
were shed from
them, and they were

1040
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,800
able to enjoy the small things
of life despite the fact

1041
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,280
that, in general, I
would say almost always

1042
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,160
people's health is not as
vigorous when they're 70

1043
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,750
as it is when they're 20.

1044
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,700
There are exceptions
to that, of course.

1045
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,650
Of course, you can adjust the
rate of cognitive and physical

1046
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,150
decline.

1047
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,850
But in general,
people in their 20s

1048
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,600
feel more physically
and mentally vigorous

1049
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,390
than they do in their
60s and 70s, in general.

1050
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,780
That u-shaped function
that I just described still

1051
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,910
holds true today,
but of course, there

1052
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,740
have been some major shifts
to the general life stages

1053
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,985
and when people undergo
those life stages.

1054
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:48,360
For instance, many people are
getting married much later.

1055
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,620
Many people are opting
to not have children.

1056
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,120
In fact, if you look at the data
on whether or not people have

1057
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,115
children or not and how
that relates to happiness,

1058
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:59,490
everyone will tell you that
their kids are their greatest

1059
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,800
source of joy, at least most
people will tell you that

1060
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,040
and are a tremendous
source of happiness.

1061
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,640
It's obvious.

1062
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,700
Kids are delightful, and
raising kids while hard

1063
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,930
is a wonderful experience.

1064
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,620
If you look at the
ratings of happiness

1065
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,600
among people that elected to not
have children versus those that

1066
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,300
had, most people
who have children

1067
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,250
report their overall
levels of happiness

1068
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,170
as lower than that of people
who opt not to have children.

1069
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,080
Now there are a lot of ways
to interpret those findings.

1070
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,800
And by no means am I encouraging
people to not have children.

1071
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,920
That's a issue that you have
to resolve for yourself,

1072
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,000
of course.

1073
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,710
But we could imagine,
for instance,

1074
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,160
that people who opt
not to have children

1075
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,890
have more income to devote
to things more focused

1076
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,500
on themselves or their partner
or other aspects of their life.

1077
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,650
We don't know if that's
the underlying reason.

1078
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,200
We could perhaps
conclude that people

1079
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,900
who opt not to have children
are getting more sleep

1080
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,260
on a regular basis or have
more time for exercise

1081
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,300
or the other sorts of
things that elevate

1082
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,250
states of mood and well-being.

1083
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,380
Again we do not know
what the underlying

1084
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,760
reasons are for this finding.

1085
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,540
But it does seem that
despite most every parent

1086
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,030
reporting that their kids are
their greatest source of joy

1087
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,920
and quote-unquote
happiness in life

1088
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,430
that people who opt not to have
children are at least as happy

1089
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,000
or report being at least
as happy or even happier

1090
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
than those that opt
to have children.

1091
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,220
And, of course, I
want to be very clear

1092
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,087
that I'm not trying to
settle any arguments about

1093
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:34,170
whether or not people
should have children or not.

1094
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,170
I happen to find children
and animals delightful.

1095
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,830
And I'm always happy when
people opt to have children

1096
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,278
provided they are taking
good care of their children

1097
00:46:43,278 --> 00:46:45,820
or doing their very best to take
good care of their children.

1098
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,340
So that's my stance.

1099
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,080
But of course,
you're all entitled

1100
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,680
to your own stance on this.

1101
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,275
There are also the
general arguments

1102
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:54,150
that people like to have
about whether or not

1103
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:57,073
the population of the Earth will
be sustained or not sustained

1104
00:46:57,073 --> 00:46:58,740
based on current birth
rates, et cetera.

1105
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,040
Indeed many areas of the world,
birth rates are going down.

1106
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,260
It is actually
something that just

1107
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,820
as a perhaps point
of interest has

1108
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,280
been studied from the somewhat
unusual but logical perspective

1109
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,420
of whether or not child diapers
are selling at the same rate

1110
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,960
as they were some years ago and
whether or not adult diapers

1111
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,380
for the elderly are being sold
at the same rate or greater.

1112
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,820
If you think about it is one
indirect measure of whether

1113
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,840
or not people are living longer
and/or opting to have children.

1114
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,590
Definitely in discussion
for another time,

1115
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,870
probably for another
podcast entirely.

1116
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,090
I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge

1117
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,250
one of our sponsors
Athletic Greens.

1118
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:41,040
Athletic Greens,
now called AG1, is

1119
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,110
a vitamin-mineral
probiotic drink

1120
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,900
that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.

1121
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,690
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,

1122
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,970
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

1123
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,803
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,

1124
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,530
and the reason I still take
Athletic Greens once or usually

1125
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,560
twice a day, is that it
gets me the probiotics

1126
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,180
that I need for gut health.

1127
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,320
Our gut is very important.

1128
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,830
It's populated by
gut microbiota that

1129
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,330
communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically

1130
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,070
all the biological
systems of our body

1131
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,610
to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health.

1132
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,530
And those probiotics
and Athletic Greens

1133
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,313
are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.

1134
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:19,230
In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number

1135
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,850
of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals

1136
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,490
that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs

1137
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:24,120
are met.

1138
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,088
And it tastes great.

1139
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:27,630
If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,

1140
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,840
you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

1141
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,390
and they'll give you five
free travel packs that make it

1142
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,377
really easy to mix up
Athletic Greens while

1143
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:37,710
you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera.

1144
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,310
And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3K2.

1145
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,920
Again that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman

1146
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,490
to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply

1147
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,200
of vitamin D3K2.

1148
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,310
So this u-shaped function
of people being happier

1149
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,740
earlier in life
and then reporting

1150
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,630
feeling far less happy
and then happiness

1151
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,480
returning to them, that is,
the rising of the u again

1152
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,390
in their later years, is
something that I do believe

1153
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,180
should be repeated
in modern times.

1154
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,600
And repeated in a way that
takes into account that you

1155
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,820
might be shifted to the right.

1156
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,140
That is, I am certainly
aware that people are

1157
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,850
tending to get married later.

1158
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,570
Many are opting to
not have children.

1159
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:20,980
So, for instance, the
question arises whether or not

1160
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,170
that u-shaped curve
should have a bump down

1161
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,860
at the bottom of
the u among those

1162
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,110
that opt not to have children.

1163
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,770
Because the argument was made in
the discussion of those papers

1164
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,260
that the reason why
happiness is lower

1165
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,390
when people are in
their 30s, 40s, and 50s

1166
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,330
is because they're devoting more
time to raising their children

1167
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,008
and devoting more time to work.

1168
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:41,800
I would hope people
would enjoy their work,

1169
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,600
but not everybody really
enjoys their work.

1170
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,083
And many people, even if
they do enjoy their work

1171
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,500
and they find
meaning in it, still

1172
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,570
find it stressful,
which certainly

1173
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,990
can run counter to happiness.

1174
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,410
Nowadays, you could imagine
that because a number of people

1175
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,260
are opting perhaps to work
less or to not have children

1176
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,312
or both, where they
find tremendous meaning

1177
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:02,770
from their work
that there would be

1178
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:07,420
a bump at the bottom of that
u among those that decided to

1179
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,113
simply not take on these
additional responsibilities.

1180
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:11,530
That would be an
interesting test,

1181
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:16,030
I think, of whether or not the
total load of responsibility

1182
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,440
is really what's correlating
with reported happiness or not.

1183
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,380
Now one very consistent
finding that has absolutely

1184
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,880
stood the test of time, and
it's kind of an interesting one.

1185
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,490
It's a little bit of a
pop psychology finding,

1186
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,980
but I think it points to
something interesting that we

1187
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,360
will return to
again and again is

1188
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,660
that people tend
to report feeling

1189
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,130
lower levels of happiness,
believe it or not,

1190
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,710
on their birthday.

1191
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:43,330
And the argument for why
this is the following.

1192
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,870
That typically, we
go through our year

1193
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:50,500
not comparing ourselves to
our peers terribly much.

1194
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,257
We might do that
a little bit more

1195
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,590
when we're in elementary
school, high school, et cetera.

1196
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,950
We're sort of age match,
maybe even college as well.

1197
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,310
But an evaluation of ourselves
to our age-match peers

1198
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,030
is not typically something
that we do on a daily basis.

1199
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,910
Whereas on our birthday,
we get a snapshot

1200
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,510
of where we are in the arc of
time, or at least in our life.

1201
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,350
And many people report feeling
rather low on their birthday

1202
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,980
because they use that as
a benchmark or a window

1203
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,530
into the things that they
have not accomplished.

1204
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,710
The things that,
despite being age blank,

1205
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,480
they still haven't accomplished.

1206
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,610
And so that's interesting
because what it really

1207
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:28,910
points to is two things.

1208
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,170
One the extent to which much
of our feelings of happiness

1209
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,910
are relative, in particular,
relative to our peers.

1210
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,570
So there's that
social aspect again.

1211
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,660
And the fact that
most of the time, we

1212
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,150
are not very good at
orienting ourselves

1213
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,253
in the longer arc of time.

1214
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:45,670
We're pretty good
at knowing where

1215
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,712
we are in the arc of a
day, or the arc of a week,

1216
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:50,680
or the arc of a month, or even
a year, but that most of us

1217
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,510
are not very good at
reflecting on where

1218
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,968
we are in our life arc.

1219
00:51:53,968 --> 00:51:55,510
And, of course, most
of us don't know

1220
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,550
how long we will
live anyway, but we

1221
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,960
do have some general sense.

1222
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,290
I mean, very few people
live past the age of 100.

1223
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,020
Many people live to be 70 or 80.

1224
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,950
And again, life span
is extending as far

1225
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,080
as we know from year to year.

1226
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,440
But, in general, people report
that on their birthdays.

1227
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,210
And I should say these
are for birthdays

1228
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:20,050
aged 25 or later, at
least in the studies

1229
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,798
I was able to access.

1230
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:23,590
I don't think that a
lot of three-year-olds

1231
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,923
sit around comparing themselves
to other three-year-olds

1232
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:27,820
and how well they're
doing or 12-year-olds.

1233
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,550
You can imagine some people
might do that at 18, et cetera.

1234
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,890
But it's really by the
mid-20s that people

1235
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,050
start evaluating
themselves to their peers

1236
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,050
in terms of life progression
and so-called milestones.

1237
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,660
It's been argued that that's
one of the reasons why people

1238
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,790
report lower affect,
lower levels of happiness

1239
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,540
on their birthday.

1240
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,498
Something that's a little
bit counterintuitive.

1241
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:47,207
And, of course, there
are things that are

1242
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:48,730
anti-correlated with happiness.

1243
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,040
I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention a few of these.

1244
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,850
That's longitudinal study,
the Harvard happiness project

1245
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,820
has reported, for
instance, that people that

1246
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,940
are chronic smokers of
nicotine and chronic

1247
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,850
consumers of alcohol, in
particular alcoholics.

1248
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,620
That is, people who
suffer from alcoholism

1249
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,950
or what sometimes is called
alcohol use disorder that

1250
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,260
is strongly anti-correlated
with happiness.

1251
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,390
And I should also mention
that the family members,

1252
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,130
and in particular,
the romantic partners

1253
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:19,720
of people who are chronic
smokers and the partners

1254
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,200
of people who are chronic
alcohol users, often

1255
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,790
will report lower
levels of happiness.

1256
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,830
Especially if they
themselves are not

1257
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:31,300
chronic smokers or regular
consumers of alcohol.

1258
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,020
So we've done episodes on
nicotine in particular,

1259
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,730
and that touched on
smoking, of course.

1260
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,370
And we've done an
episode on alcohol

1261
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,740
and the effects of
alcohol on health.

1262
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,810
Again, you can find
those at hubermanlab.com.

1263
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,990
This study from the
Harvard happiness project

1264
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,690
really has strong
data supporting

1265
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,810
the fact that avoiding
being a nicotine smoker.

1266
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,888
There are positive health
effects of nicotine

1267
00:53:54,888 --> 00:53:56,680
that are discussed in
the episode nicotine.

1268
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,440
But being a-- but smoking
nicotine, in particular,

1269
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,460
is counterproductive for
people's at least self-reported

1270
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,530
happiness and certainly
overall health.

1271
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,140
I think there's zero question
that smoking increases

1272
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,730
cancers of different kinds.

1273
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,650
And that alcohol consumption.

1274
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,440
And in particular, alcohol
consumption beyond two

1275
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,390
drinks per week.

1276
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,850
Two drinks being the
typical volume of a beer,

1277
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,920
a glass of wine or
cocktail, et cetera,

1278
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,087
is detrimental for
various aspects of health.

1279
00:54:23,087 --> 00:54:24,670
And, of course, there
are other things

1280
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,150
that you could imagine would
relate to a lack of happiness.

1281
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,230
For instance, a major trauma.

1282
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,500
Physical or emotional trauma.

1283
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,690
That could include the loss
of a major relationship,

1284
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,000
a death of a close one.

1285
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,210
Being the victim of a violent
crime and things of that sort.

1286
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:45,070
And yet it's been argued, in
fact, strongly argued that when

1287
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:49,420
you look at people's levels
of happiness after a trauma,

1288
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,070
that if you wait
about a year or so,

1289
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,230
sometimes is even as
short as three months

1290
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,380
after a trauma, that
people self-reported levels

1291
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,830
of happiness are not
significantly lower than they

1292
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,360
were prior to the trauma.

1293
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,830
Now I very much want to
highlight, underline, and bold

1294
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:11,322
and asterisks that
statement as one

1295
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:13,030
that we really need
to explore carefully.

1296
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:17,230
Because there are other data
that strongly point to the fact

1297
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,080
that major life
traumas can severely

1298
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,270
disrupt one sense of
happiness and well-being.

1299
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,728
And I think as long as we're
going to have this discussion,

1300
00:55:24,728 --> 00:55:27,790
we should point to a useful
definition of trauma.

1301
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,830
And the definition
that I'll paraphrase

1302
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,940
is one that was supplied by a
former guest on the Huberman

1303
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,330
Lab podcast, Dr. Paul Conti,
who's a psychiatrist who's

1304
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,710
written a book called Trauma.

1305
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,492
I personally think it's the
best book on trauma and tools

1306
00:55:42,492 --> 00:55:43,450
for alleviating trauma.

1307
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:47,350
It's incredibly thorough, easy
to read, and well-informed.

1308
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,897
And here again,
I'm paraphrasing,

1309
00:55:49,897 --> 00:55:52,480
but Dr. Conti describes trauma
as something that fundamentally

1310
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,440
changes the way that our
brain and body function

1311
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,990
in a way that makes
other aspects of living

1312
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,580
more challenging.

1313
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,520
Again, an event, either
emotional or physical,

1314
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,560
or both, that fundamentally
changes the way

1315
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,000
that our brain and/or
body, our nervous system,

1316
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,420
and other organs function
in a way that prevents us

1317
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,910
from enjoying daily activities.

1318
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,830
And that could even be
ongoing distraction.

1319
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:20,110
Traumas can create
rumination, or they

1320
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,870
can create obsessive thought,
or they can create dissociation.

1321
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,200
Any number of different things.

1322
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,830
Again check out that
episode with Dr. Paul Conti

1323
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,570
if you'd like to learn
more about trauma

1324
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,470
and how it manifests.

1325
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,020
But the idea that's
been put forth

1326
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,750
by a number of researchers
in the field of happiness

1327
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,450
that three months after
a major trauma, people

1328
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,870
aren't reported that they
are feeling any less happy

1329
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,270
than before the trauma,
that was surprising to me.

1330
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,220
So I went into this
literature a bit more deeply.

1331
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,480
One of the basis of that
general line of thinking

1332
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,290
is a-- what I consider a now
classic and very important

1333
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,270
and frankly excellent
talk that was

1334
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:58,750
given by Professor Dan Gilbert
on the science of happiness.

1335
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,780
You can find this on YouTube.

1336
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,840
I say a classic one because
it was done some years ago.

1337
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,850
It's received millions of views.

1338
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,100
And one of the points that
he makes in that talk which

1339
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,140
is grounded in
research carried out

1340
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,530
by his laboratory and other
laboratories is that--

1341
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,250
he poses a question.

1342
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,790
He says you know,
let's do a quiz.

1343
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,260
Would you rather be someone
who wins the lottery

1344
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,260
and he shows a picture
of somebody who just won,

1345
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,510
I think it was several
hundreds of millions of dollars

1346
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,140
in the lottery, or was
recently made paraplegic lost

1347
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,950
use of their legs?

1348
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,280
And then goes on to
state that one year

1349
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,210
after people have
won the lottery,

1350
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,860
this major monetary windfall
versus have become paraplegic

1351
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,680
is that their self-reported
levels of happiness

1352
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,770
are the same.

1353
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,030
Which I think is
incredibly surprising.

1354
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,900
I heard this, and I immediately
thought of an experience

1355
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,560
that I've had where I
teach a course at Stanford

1356
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,020
School of Medicine on
neural regeneration.

1357
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,510
And it's actually a course
that I attended some years

1358
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,170
ago when I was a
post-doc at Stanford,

1359
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,000
so well over a decade ago.

1360
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,630
And we had-- excuse me.

1361
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:09,180
We had an individual
come into the course.

1362
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,030
This was an older gentleman.

1363
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:13,550
So older meaning he
was in his early 70s.

1364
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,370
And he had become paraplegic
fairly late in life

1365
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,020
from a cycling accident.

1366
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:23,610
And he was and is
an expert in what

1367
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,410
it is to become a
paraplegic, of course,

1368
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,827
because he had that experience,
but also because he spends

1369
00:58:27,827 --> 00:58:30,120
a lot of his time doing
volunteer work with people who

1370
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,670
have become paraplegic
and have become paraplegic

1371
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:33,540
at different ages.

1372
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,470
And what he described to me
was that the overall outcomes

1373
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,990
for people that are
rendered paraplegic

1374
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,760
in terms of their mental health
and their physical well-being

1375
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,110
and their management
of general life skills

1376
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,400
scales with how early
they had that injury

1377
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,570
and how long they had
the use of their limbs.

1378
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,300
So it's not straightforward.

1379
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,190
When I heard this result
described by Dr. Dan Gilbert,

1380
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,440
that winning the lottery
and becoming paraplegic

1381
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,230
basically don't impact
your levels of happiness

1382
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:10,220
to any different degree when
people look back a year later,

1383
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,150
I was pretty surprised
given my experience

1384
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,170
of hearing this
lecture at Stanford.

1385
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:17,140
So I thought, wow,
from what I understand.

1386
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,360
Indeed, there are people
who are rendered paraplegic

1387
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,000
and manage that
transition very easily.

1388
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,592
It doesn't seem to disrupt
their feelings of well-being,

1389
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:26,050
et cetera, but for
other people, it

1390
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:30,610
can be severely disrupting
to their sense of well-being

1391
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,230
and so on and so forth.

1392
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:35,290
I went back and
examined these data.

1393
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:37,690
And in fact, a
subsequent talk, it's

1394
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:40,390
actually a podcast that
was given by Dr. Dan

1395
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,167
Gilbert some years later.

1396
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,750
So this would be
just a few years ago.

1397
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,180
I think in 2019-- there
is a specific date

1398
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,430
in which it was recorded
but just a few years ago.

1399
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:53,050
And indeed, he corrects
himself in that podcast.

1400
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:57,040
What he says is that he
misspoke in that earlier talk.

1401
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,550
That the difference in
self-reported levels

1402
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,760
of happiness for those that
have been rendered paraplegic

1403
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,860
for versus those who've won the
lottery is not as great as one

1404
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,445
would expect.

1405
01:00:09,445 --> 01:00:12,070
I think most people would expect
that being rendered paraplegic

1406
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,200
would make people
far less happy.

1407
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,210
That's the expectation,
I think, anyway.

1408
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,890
And that people would
win the lottery,

1409
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,360
at least for some
period of time,

1410
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,190
would be far happier
than they were

1411
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,770
prior to winning the lottery.

1412
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:26,510
And especially given the
tremendous amount of money.

1413
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,600
And again, the fact that
money can't buy happiness,

1414
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,410
but that money does
indeed enable the ability

1415
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,990
to buffer stress
provided people were

1416
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,490
responsible with
that money and just

1417
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,320
didn't blow it or spend
it all right away.

1418
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,120
That they could start
to afford things

1419
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,730
that they couldn't afford, not
just in terms of luxury items

1420
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,700
but also the
ability to hire help

1421
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,200
that would free up time that
would allow them to do anything

1422
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,997
from travel that they couldn't
access before to meditate

1423
01:00:49,997 --> 01:00:52,580
if that was something that they
didn't have time to do before.

1424
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,020
And so on and so forth.

1425
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:58,120
So the result quote
unquote that winners

1426
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,710
of the lottery and
recent paraplegics

1427
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:02,350
have the same levels of
happiness is actually not true.

1428
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,440
At least according to the
author of the original study.

1429
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,950
Now what he did not point to is
the degree to which that is not

1430
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,377
true, but he did point to
the direction of the result.

1431
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,960
And the fact that people who are
rendered paraplegic, in fact,

1432
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,850
are reporting
themselves as less happy

1433
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,560
than they were prior
to their injury.

1434
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,200
And certainly that their
levels of happiness

1435
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,753
are lower than those that
simply won the lottery

1436
01:01:24,753 --> 01:01:26,670
hundreds of millions of
dollars, which I think

1437
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,960
is the more intuitive result.

1438
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,830
And so I think it's important
to be aware of that discrepancy

1439
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,330
because it's something
that was lost

1440
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,270
in the communication
around those results

1441
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,390
the first time around.

1442
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,530
And indeed, Dan Gilbert
is an excellent scientist

1443
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,280
and was quite good about trying
to correct the narrative.

1444
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,178
I myself, as a podcaster
who puts information

1445
01:01:47,178 --> 01:01:49,470
on the internet, know that
the challenges of correcting

1446
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:52,945
narratives, especially of things
that came out some time ago,

1447
01:01:52,945 --> 01:01:54,570
we always attempt to
do this as best we

1448
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,090
can, but not everyone that
saw that first video will

1449
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:00,240
necessarily hear the discussion
that has happened subsequently.

1450
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,280
So my hope is that Dr. Gilbert
will interpret me communicating

1451
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,260
this now not as an
attempt to criticize him

1452
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,510
but rather as an attempt
to praise his willingness

1453
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,100
to try and correct the
narrative to be more accurate.

1454
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,090
So to be very clear about what
this study did and didn't show.

1455
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:18,720
And here, I'm going to
combine these results

1456
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,030
with other studies
that I was able to find

1457
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,890
that explored
similar phenomenon.

1458
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,050
So major trauma, for instance.

1459
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,050
Not necessarily becoming
paraplegic but traumas

1460
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,630
of a different sort,
emotional traumas.

1461
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,060
When you look at the whole
of those data, at least,

1462
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:38,340
my read is that when people win
the lottery or acquire wealth

1463
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,220
through inheritance, some
form of wealth acquisition

1464
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,670
that is sudden and that wasn't
preceded by a specific effort

1465
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:45,900
to gain that wealth, right.

1466
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,330
Buying a lottery ticket
is a pretty quick thing.

1467
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,640
Inheritance is something
that you simply

1468
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,390
get by virtue of who you are,
not necessarily by effort.

1469
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:59,460
Well, that led to increases
in self-reported happiness

1470
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,430
compared to prior to the
inheritance of the lottery win,

1471
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,800
but it wasn't as
substantial as you

1472
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,440
might imagine if
you are approaching

1473
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,900
the notion of
happiness simply from,

1474
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,000
well, more money
equals more happiness.

1475
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,290
And while it is true that people
who are rendered paraplegic

1476
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:20,940
or who undergo psychological
traumas or physical traumas

1477
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,690
of any various kind
are, and frankly,

1478
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:28,200
are remarkably
resilient in many cases.

1479
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,380
They can still manage to
go about life and work

1480
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,870
and engage in
relationships, et cetera.

1481
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:38,100
There is a visible decrease
in overall levels of happiness

1482
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,470
and well-being,
in particular, if

1483
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,690
the psychological
and physical trauma

1484
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:47,580
renders their nervous system
different in a way that

1485
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,810
impacts other major areas of
life and enjoyment for them.

1486
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,850
And that's certainly true
one year out from the trauma.

1487
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,118
So the point is that
we do need to reframe

1488
01:03:57,118 --> 01:03:59,160
this idea that whether or
not you win the lottery

1489
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,463
or become paraplegic or
suffer some major trauma,

1490
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:02,880
your levels of
happiness are going

1491
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,130
to be the same three
months or a year later.

1492
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,910
I don't think that's accurate.

1493
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:09,510
And in fact, Dr. Dan
Gilbert emphasized

1494
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:13,260
that that's not accurate
even in that initial study.

1495
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,060
And I think it's
an important thing

1496
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,730
to frame because that's
such a popular notion.

1497
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,980
Or that that idea
combined with the idea

1498
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,530
that increased earnings
don't make us happy

1499
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,910
combined with the idea that
we are happy early in life

1500
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:30,270
but then as more demands arise
in life, we become less happy,

1501
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,770
and then we become happy again.

1502
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,750
And that idea is
we already explored

1503
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,785
is not necessarily true.

1504
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:36,660
Frankly, I knew a lot
of teenagers and people

1505
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,235
in their early 20s that
are pretty unhappy who

1506
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:41,610
then become happier later as
they acquire more resources.

1507
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,740
Sometimes distance,
let's be honest,

1508
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,260
sometimes distance from
our family of origin

1509
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,510
makes us more happy,
sometimes less so.

1510
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,990
It's highly individual.

1511
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:53,400
So I think those general themes
that we've heard over and over,

1512
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,500
while they have merit and
they certainly stand up

1513
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,870
in some of the more
powerful longitudinal

1514
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:01,350
and short-term studies, there
is nuance, and in some cases,

1515
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,420
there are now additional
data that are causing us

1516
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,430
to revise those understandings.

1517
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:06,990
Now there is an
important point, or I

1518
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,740
should say the important
point, that we can really

1519
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,640
credit Dan Gilbert and others
in the field of psychology with

1520
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,950
and that we owe them a
great debt of gratitude

1521
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:21,390
for is that we do
have far more control

1522
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:24,180
over our levels of happiness
than we might think.

1523
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,420
And many of the
things that reside

1524
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,070
at that level of control.

1525
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,870
That is, the things that we can
do and think and say and access

1526
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,870
don't come from external things.

1527
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:40,380
They don't come necessarily
from the acquisition of material

1528
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,900
goods, but rather
there are things

1529
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:47,400
that we can do that can allow
us to so-called synthesize

1530
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,040
happiness.

1531
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,010
And I think this is
one of the great gifts

1532
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:52,950
of modern psychology is that--

1533
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,620
Dan Gilbert and others, the
Harvard happiness project,

1534
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,690
work at Yale and elsewhere.

1535
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:01,380
There are excellent labs working
on happiness all over the US

1536
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,580
and all over the world, frankly.

1537
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,550
One of the great gifts
that they've supplied us

1538
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:07,920
in the form of data
is that there really

1539
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,070
are things that we can all
do and think and access

1540
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:14,400
to allow ourselves to
so-called synthesize happiness.

1541
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,190
Now, this notion of
synthesizing happiness,

1542
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:20,070
or synthetic happiness
as it's sometimes called,

1543
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,200
can sometimes ruffle
people's feathers a bit.

1544
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,620
Because people immediately
flip to the idea

1545
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,270
that, oh, you're
just going to tell

1546
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,720
me to be grateful for what
I have or to just navel

1547
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,763
gaze or just to
imagine that I'm happy.

1548
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:34,680
But that's really not
what synthetic happiness

1549
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,587
is about at all.

1550
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:37,170
Synthetic happiness
actually has to do

1551
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:41,250
with some really important
larger principles about the way

1552
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,980
that our emotional
system and the way

1553
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,330
that the reward systems of
our brain really function.

1554
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:50,550
And they point to
important concepts

1555
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,260
that we're going to now discuss.

1556
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:55,270
Things like the hedonic
set point, for instance.

1557
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,960
Or the dopamine
system of anticipation

1558
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,350
of rewards versus receiving
words just as a brief insight

1559
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,550
into that.

1560
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:05,190
Our anticipation of
something positive

1561
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:08,100
oftentimes leads to
greater increases

1562
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,870
in the sorts of
neurochemicals that

1563
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,390
support a state of
happiness and well-being

1564
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:15,780
then the actual
acquisition of the thing

1565
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,040
that we're trying to obtain.

1566
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,457
And this goes back
to a theme I've

1567
01:07:18,457 --> 01:07:21,040
discussed a few times
before in this podcast,

1568
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,820
in particular with my colleague
at Stanford School of Medicine,

1569
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,940
Dr. Anna Lembke, who wrote the
fabulous book Dopamine Nation.

1570
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,160
If you're interested in
dopamine and addiction,

1571
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,100
in particular, that's
a wonderful clear,

1572
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,830
and extremely informative read.

1573
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:36,750
And if you're interested
in dopamine more

1574
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,580
generally, not just in
the states of addiction

1575
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,390
but in everyday life and
in pursuit and motivation,

1576
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:45,432
The Molecule of More is an
excellent book related to that.

1577
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:46,890
And as I mentioned
earlier, we have

1578
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:49,680
this episode on dopamine
motivation and drive.

1579
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,700
The notion of
synthetic happiness

1580
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,760
is not simply about
imagining happiness,

1581
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,310
or thinking about happiness
or anticipating happiness.

1582
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,950
To some extent, it is,
but it relates to a number

1583
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,330
of other important themes.

1584
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:05,670
But it is grounded
very thoroughly

1585
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:09,030
in the neurobiology
of dopamine rewards.

1586
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:12,070
And I'll talk about some of that
neurobiology in a few moments.

1587
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,700
But I want to take
a couple of minutes

1588
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,920
and talk about what
synthetic happiness is

1589
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,660
and what some of
the conditions are

1590
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,729
for allowing us to
access the state

1591
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,479
of so-called
synthetic happiness.

1592
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,600
And I want to point
out at the outset

1593
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,979
that synthetic happiness, while
it might sound synthetic A.K.A.

1594
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,080
false, it's anything but.

1595
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,990
It actually turns out to be
among the more and perhaps

1596
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:35,850
the more potent
form of happiness

1597
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,109
that we can all access.

1598
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:41,069
And this is where themes
related to our control

1599
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:43,170
over our own
internal state really

1600
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:46,010
become not only valid
but very powerful.

1601
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:50,380
So, for instance, Dr.
Dan Gilbert and others

1602
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:55,420
have explored how opportunity
and choice, that is, freedom

1603
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,729
can and can't lead to
states of happiness.

1604
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:01,640
And the results of those studies
are very solid and, frankly,

1605
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,950
very surprising.

1606
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:05,830
Until you understand the
results, and once you do,

1607
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:08,800
I think you will immediately
see areas of your own life

1608
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,800
that you can start to
access more happiness, again

1609
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,620
genuine happiness,
simply by framing

1610
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,359
certain choices in
a particular way

1611
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:18,729
and maybe even by
eliminating choices.

1612
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:20,649
Now I'd like to focus
on the research aimed

1613
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:24,250
at understanding what increases
our levels of happiness.

1614
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,010
And I'd like to frame this
under the umbrella of two

1615
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:27,830
major themes.

1616
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,729
The first theme is
so-called natural happiness.

1617
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:33,430
Natural happiness is the sort
of happiness that most of us

1618
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:34,760
are familiar with.

1619
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,700
So the kind of
happiness that we expect

1620
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,479
to have if we, for
instance, complete a degree.

1621
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,149
Hopefully, a degree in a topic
meaningful and interesting

1622
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:45,430
to us but a degree nonetheless.

1623
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,590
Or we find a mate.

1624
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,990
Hopefully, a mate that we
enjoy spending time with.

1625
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,020
Or, for instance, making a
certain income or finding

1626
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,450
work that we enjoy
on a regular basis.

1627
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,980
All of those are
forms of happiness

1628
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:59,440
that, from a very early
time in development,

1629
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,830
we are taught exist.

1630
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,580
For instance, even
when we are very young,

1631
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,230
we are told that our
birthday is coming

1632
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:06,550
and that we are going
to get presents,

1633
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:07,967
and those presents
are going to be

1634
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:11,012
focused on knowledge of
things that we already enjoy.

1635
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,970
So if you're a little
kid, and you like trucks,

1636
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:15,100
or you're a little kid
and you like dolls,

1637
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,920
you can sort of expect that
those gifts will bring you

1638
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,690
some level of joy or happiness.

1639
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:22,540
And while that's a
small child example,

1640
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,850
that general notion
of natural happiness

1641
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:28,960
is, of course, one that
persists into adolescence,

1642
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,580
into young adulthood,
and into adulthood.

1643
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:35,020
And we quite understandably
come to associate

1644
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:39,280
this feeling of joy or happiness
with the receiving of things

1645
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,830
or the acquisition of
things, whether by effort,

1646
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:44,390
by gift, by inheritance,
or some other form.

1647
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,680
So that's natural happiness.

1648
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,520
And yet, as I mentioned
a little bit earlier,

1649
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,250
there's also this notion
of synthetic happiness.

1650
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,800
And some of the more interesting
and exciting research

1651
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,470
in the fields of psychology
and, in fact, neuroscience

1652
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:59,800
point to this idea of
synthetic happiness

1653
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,700
as at least as powerful
a source of happiness

1654
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,380
as natural happiness.

1655
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:09,250
Again, at least as powerful
and perhaps even more powerful.

1656
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:12,340
And of course, one has to take a
slightly different view of what

1657
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,430
happiness is in order to accept
this idea that we can create

1658
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:19,090
happiness for ourselves,
but that doesn't mean

1659
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:21,370
that the whole notion
of synthetic happiness

1660
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:23,230
is merely a passive
one where all we

1661
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,710
do is sit back and imagine being
happy and then we are happy.

1662
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:28,930
For better or for worse,
our nervous systems

1663
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:32,210
and our neurochemistry
simply don't work that way.

1664
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:34,600
In fact, synthetic
happiness has almost always

1665
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,430
been understood as
something that we

1666
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:38,980
have to put some effort
toward achieving.

1667
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:42,280
But, and this is an
important thing to point out,

1668
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,710
synthetic happiness
also requires

1669
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:48,520
that certain situational
or environmental conditions

1670
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,990
be met.

1671
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:53,590
A good example of this is some
of the work by Gillian Mandich,

1672
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,930
or I should say Dr.
Gillian Mandich, who's

1673
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:59,230
done some interesting work on
the conditions for creating

1674
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:03,370
happiness within our mind and
in our overall state of being.

1675
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:06,250
And she's been involved in a
number of different studies.

1676
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,890
But one of the ones that I
found particularly interesting

1677
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:13,030
is one in which they explored
different types of music

1678
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:15,430
and other aspects of
environmental settings.

1679
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:17,260
So you bring subjects
to the laboratory

1680
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,850
play them different
types of music.

1681
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:22,120
There are, in fact,
certain aspects of music

1682
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,950
that can create different
states of mind sadness,

1683
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,830
happiness, anticipation.

1684
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,930
In fact, there are
certain patterns of music

1685
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:32,770
that can reliably induce
anticipation of the fear

1686
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,360
and anxiety base type.

1687
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,120
So, for instance,
think the movie Jaws.

1688
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,460
If you recall, for those
of you who have seen Jaws,

1689
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,790
there's this ongoing
theme music any time

1690
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:46,690
the shark might be present in
the water or in a given scene.

1691
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:49,300
That essentially goes [HUMMING]

1692
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,100
Now for the musicians
out there, this

1693
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,350
has basis in things
like tritones and things

1694
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,420
that are understood
from the mathematics

1695
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,100
and the musical side.

1696
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,810
And from the
neuroscience side, are

1697
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:02,860
known to create a neural
state of anticipation.

1698
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,840
Yeah, a neural state
of anticipation

1699
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,880
and not necessarily
a positive one.

1700
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,120
And indeed, there are
other patterns of music

1701
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,670
that involve up tones.

1702
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:16,750
Think some of the music
that's typically been used

1703
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,210
in cartoons of various sorts.

1704
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:20,590
There's a long history of this.

1705
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,180
Indeed there's a
whole literature

1706
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,410
of psychological and now even
a smaller but still interesting

1707
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,570
literature on the
neuroscience of how

1708
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,820
certain patterns
of music can induce

1709
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:34,210
a state of joy and joyful
anticipation, in particular.

1710
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,760
A lot of those patterns
of music are incorporated

1711
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,760
into so-called happy
cartoons and Disney movies

1712
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,230
and things of that sort.

1713
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:46,290
In any case, Dr. Mandich and
others have explored how music,

1714
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,590
in particular, but other
features of the environment can

1715
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,210
or cannot induce
states of happiness.

1716
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,160
And the basic takeaway
from those studies

1717
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:58,890
is that while having a
certain environmental sound,

1718
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:05,130
musical tone, or visual feature
to a given space, a room,

1719
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:08,080
is necessary for a
state of happiness,

1720
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,750
it is not alone sufficient.

1721
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:13,500
What is required is that
individuals not only

1722
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,300
be placed into an
environment that

1723
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:20,220
contains music or visual items
or a combination of music

1724
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,620
and visual items that
can induce states

1725
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,560
of joy or happiness or
positive anticipation,

1726
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,550
but that they also are given
some sort of instruction

1727
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:33,180
or instruction manual as
how to synthesize happiness

1728
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,650
inside of that environment.

1729
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,530
This is important
because what this

1730
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:40,950
says is that our ability to
create states of happiness

1731
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:44,610
is dependent on our environment
but also requires effort

1732
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:46,080
from us.

1733
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,320
That also makes sense as to why
when we are under conditions

1734
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,315
of deprivation.

1735
01:14:50,315 --> 01:14:51,690
So it could be
social deprivation

1736
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,280
or financial deprivation.

1737
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,310
Or even for people that are
very sensitive to whether.

1738
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:59,550
There are a certain number
of individuals, about 30%

1739
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:03,300
of people, who report feeling
very, very low under conditions

1740
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,550
where the sky is overcast.

1741
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:07,890
Especially if it's been
overcast for a number of days.

1742
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,770
The so-called seasonal
affective depression.

1743
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,960
Those individuals,
by the way, can often

1744
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,820
receive tremendous
benefits in terms

1745
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,470
of elevating their mood if they
make an effort to get sunlight.

1746
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,970
And if they can't get sunlight,
artificial light of the sort

1747
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,490
that we talked about earlier.

1748
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:24,360
But in any case,
there are a number

1749
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,380
of people that are profoundly
negatively influenced

1750
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:33,060
by the lack of positive
visual and auditory cues

1751
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,050
in their environment.

1752
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:37,380
But for most people,
we are in what

1753
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,270
I would call a
dynamic relationship

1754
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,400
with our environment.

1755
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,150
Our environment has
an effect on our mood.

1756
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,130
But the research
indicates that we also

1757
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:47,460
need to make some sort of
effort toward being happy.

1758
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,890
Now effort toward being
happy is a very vague term.

1759
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:53,010
So let's better
define what that is.

1760
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:55,530
In the case of Dr.
Mandich's work,

1761
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:58,290
this took the form of
doing so-called happiness

1762
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:00,000
inventories, right.

1763
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,270
That can be focusing on things
that one is grateful for,

1764
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:05,850
things that they
particularly enjoy.

1765
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,390
This is somewhat of a
gratitude-type practice

1766
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:11,220
but includes some
other features as well

1767
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,930
that are more focused
on the things that

1768
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:15,372
bring you meaning and actually
engaging in the things

1769
01:16:15,372 --> 01:16:16,330
that bring you meaning.

1770
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:17,913
So if you're trying
to think about how

1771
01:16:17,913 --> 01:16:20,370
to improve your levels
of happiness, what

1772
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:23,340
this research essentially
says is that you would

1773
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,640
be smart to try and adjust
your home environment,

1774
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,288
adjust your work environment
so that it is cheerful to you.

1775
01:16:29,288 --> 01:16:30,330
Maybe that means a plant.

1776
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:33,180
For me, in my laboratory,
one of the things

1777
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,400
that was really critical
that I had as a postdoc

1778
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,110
and in my own laboratory when
I first started my lab was I

1779
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:40,950
love aquaria.

1780
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,360
So I had multiple fish tanks.

1781
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,370
In fact, people in my laboratory
were always rolling their eyes.

1782
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:46,870
Why do we have to have all these
fish tanks with all these--

1783
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:50,022
I like freshwater tanks,
not saltwater tanks,

1784
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,480
for reasons that
aren't interesting

1785
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,313
for this discussion.

1786
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:56,268
But freshwater tanks with discus
fish, for instance, to me,

1787
01:16:56,268 --> 01:16:57,060
are just beautiful.

1788
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:57,910
They make me happy.

1789
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,370
I just enjoy them.

1790
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:01,260
Music is a complicated
thing in laboratories

1791
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,560
because it's a shared space.

1792
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,040
So headphones are the
general requirement.

1793
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,945
But having either silence
if you love silence.

1794
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:09,570
And I happen to like
working in silence

1795
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:11,195
or listening to
certain forms of music.

1796
01:17:11,195 --> 01:17:14,580
I do also use the 40
Hertz binaural beats.

1797
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:19,320
Or I particularly like listening
to Glenn Gould while I work

1798
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,340
or listening to whale
song, believe it or not,

1799
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,040
while I work because it doesn't
have any structure that I

1800
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,740
can follow.

1801
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,920
I don't speak whale,
and so I can't follow.

1802
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,530
But it sort of fills the space
in a way that I find pleasant.

1803
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,780
And I've put substantial
amounts of effort

1804
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,690
into making my laboratory
spaces and my office

1805
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:37,200
spaces, my workspaces,
nice places to be.

1806
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,180
Now I had no
knowledge of this work

1807
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:42,092
from Dr. Mandich and others
at the time when I did that.

1808
01:17:42,092 --> 01:17:43,800
But what I found was
that over the years,

1809
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,117
I was challenged in maintaining
a kind of elevated mood

1810
01:17:48,117 --> 01:17:50,700
while working in a laboratory,
not because I didn't thoroughly

1811
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,992
enjoy the work, I love doing
experiments with my hands,

1812
01:17:52,992 --> 01:17:55,988
and I loved being in lab, but
at least the labs that I was

1813
01:17:55,988 --> 01:17:57,780
in as a graduate student
and post-doc there

1814
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:00,390
were no windows so I wasn't
getting adequate sunshine.

1815
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,910
The windows that we
didn't open, so I

1816
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:05,590
wasn't getting a lot of fresh
air, and so on and so forth.

1817
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:07,680
So I've personally
found it very valuable

1818
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,770
to create an environment
both at work and at home

1819
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:14,660
that I find aesthetically
pleasant, at least in some way

1820
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,160
or another.

1821
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,827
And I realize people
have varying levels

1822
01:18:16,827 --> 01:18:19,740
of control over their
aesthetic environment.

1823
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,457
Certainly, the
auditory environment

1824
01:18:21,457 --> 01:18:23,790
can be controlled nowadays
through the use of headphones

1825
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,082
if you're allowed to use those.

1826
01:18:25,082 --> 01:18:28,380
So, for instance, using music
or using background sound

1827
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,930
that you find very
pleasant combined

1828
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:33,450
with a concerted
effort on your part

1829
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:38,940
to create states of happiness
by hopefully doing work that's

1830
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,340
meaningful to you or at least is
leading to meaningful outcomes.

1831
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,380
We'll talk a little
bit more about that.

1832
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,530
But these happiness
inventories also

1833
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:49,740
turn out to be interesting and
important sources of creating

1834
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,300
so-called synthetic happiness.

1835
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,800
And we'll also talk
about other ways

1836
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,830
that one can create elevated
levels of synthetic happiness.

1837
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,600
And I realize the word
synthetic probably

1838
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,420
draws up connotations
of false happiness

1839
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,770
or contrived happiness.

1840
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,900
I wish instead of calling
it synthetic happiness.

1841
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,665
They had called it
self-created or self-directed

1842
01:19:06,665 --> 01:19:08,790
happiness or something of
that sort because then it

1843
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,560
wouldn't sound as false.

1844
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,050
Because it's simply not false.

1845
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,480
It leads to the
same, as far as we

1846
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,730
know, identical neurochemical
and psychological states

1847
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:19,147
of happiness as
natural happiness.

1848
01:19:19,147 --> 01:19:21,090
And might even be
more persistent

1849
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,440
than natural happiness.

1850
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,630
It certainly, is more
under our control.

1851
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:26,430
But the key point
is that environment

1852
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:31,560
and self-directed work at
being happy are both important,

1853
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,400
and they interact
with one another.

1854
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,000
So if you're somebody who
has a hard time synthesizing

1855
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,160
happiness through
any of the methods

1856
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:42,353
that we talk about today, don't
consider yourself deficient.

1857
01:19:42,353 --> 01:19:44,770
It could very well be that the
environment that you're in,

1858
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,562
social environment or
physical environment,

1859
01:19:46,562 --> 01:19:48,250
or auditory environment,
is simply not

1860
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,118
conducive to
synthesizing happiness.

1861
01:19:51,118 --> 01:19:52,660
And for that reason,
I think the work

1862
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,120
of Gillian Mandich and
colleagues and others

1863
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,910
in the field is tremendously
important because it removes us

1864
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:01,120
from this pressure to
just synthesize happiness

1865
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,340
from within despite
our circumstances.

1866
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,820
I think many of us have heard
of the incredible stories

1867
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:10,120
of people like Viktor
Frankl or Nelson Mandela who

1868
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,280
were stripped of
their freedom and yet

1869
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,160
managed to maintain some
sense of positive anticipation

1870
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,460
or at least some
sense of identity

1871
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,490
that allowed them to still
access forms of happiness.

1872
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,620
Those are highly unique
situations, of course.

1873
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,920
And they speak to the
power of the human psyche

1874
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,860
for synthesizing happiness
and certainly for synthesizing

1875
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,620
a sense that there might
be a future and to live

1876
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,670
into that future.

1877
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:36,228
In their cases, incredibly
impressive ways.

1878
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:38,770
But I think for most everybody,
the environment that we're in

1879
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,930
has a powerful
impact on our mood.

1880
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:43,337
And some people
more than others.

1881
01:20:43,337 --> 01:20:45,670
I know people that are perfectly
happy with blank walls.

1882
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:46,712
No pictures on the walls.

1883
01:20:46,712 --> 01:20:48,460
Other people
benefit tremendously

1884
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,800
from having photos or plants
in their environment and so on.

1885
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,160
You really have to determine
what's needed for you

1886
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,552
and do your best
to try and place

1887
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,010
those things into
your environment,

1888
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:59,260
or rather, place yourself
into an environment that

1889
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,420
is conducive to you
synthesizing your happiness.

1890
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,180
In fact, the
powerful interaction

1891
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,820
between our environment
and our own ability

1892
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,850
to generate certain
kinds of emotions

1893
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:11,810
is well established
not just for happiness

1894
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,060
but for things like gratitude.

1895
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:16,450
So, for instance, there's a
classic study from AMES A-M-E-S

1896
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:20,590
in 2004 that was
focused on gratitude.

1897
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,230
And we've had an episode
on gratitude before.

1898
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,820
The basic takeaway
of that episode

1899
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:28,270
is that it turns out
receiving gratitude

1900
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:33,010
is a more powerful
stimulus for the release

1901
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,680
of neurochemicals and activation
of brain areas associated

1902
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,240
with so-called
prosocial behaviors

1903
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,300
and feelings of well-being,
including happiness.

1904
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,860
But also observing stories in
the form of movies or books

1905
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:47,140
or other narratives of
other people receiving help

1906
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,570
is also a very powerful
stimulus for gratitude.

1907
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:52,930
Also, giving gratitude
is very powerful but not

1908
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,060
as powerful as receiving
gratitude, at least

1909
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,010
that's what the research
says, or observing

1910
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:00,370
powerful exchanges of gratitude
between other individuals.

1911
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,260
What the study
from AMES showed is

1912
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:06,550
that gratitude as a state
of mind and as an emotion

1913
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:08,390
does not exist in a vacuum.

1914
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:11,602
It's not independent
of our surroundings.

1915
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:13,060
So, for instance,
just writing down

1916
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,852
all the things you're
grateful for while it

1917
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:17,440
has some positive impact,
the impact of that

1918
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,960
or receiving gratitude
or observing gratitude

1919
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,420
is far more potent, right.

1920
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,940
Bigger increases in
happiness and feelings

1921
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,190
of well-being and indeed
neurochemicals and activation

1922
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:30,160
of brain areas associated
with happiness and well-being

1923
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,020
when there's a reciprocity.

1924
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,147
When the person receiving
understands something

1925
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:36,730
about the person
that's giving to them

1926
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,897
and understands that the
person is giving genuinely,

1927
01:22:38,897 --> 01:22:39,439
for instance.

1928
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:41,105
So there's an
environmental interaction.

1929
01:22:41,105 --> 01:22:42,700
It's not just about
receiving, it's

1930
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:46,210
receiving from somebody that you
know genuinely wants to give.

1931
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:49,450
And likewise, for the
giver in that equation,

1932
01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:51,970
the feelings of
well-being are far greater

1933
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:54,550
when the person
receiving whatever

1934
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:58,390
it is money, food, assistance
in some form or another.

1935
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,970
Could be physical
assistance, et cetera.

1936
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:04,030
When the giver has knowledge
that the person receiving it

1937
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:06,187
genuinely needed the thing
that they are receiving.

1938
01:23:06,187 --> 01:23:08,770
So the important finding within
the research, again and again,

1939
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:12,020
is that happiness doesn't
exist in a vacuum.

1940
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,990
It's partially our
own responsibility

1941
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,990
to synthesize happiness.

1942
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,407
You know, I was told that many
times you're like happiness

1943
01:23:17,407 --> 01:23:18,100
is in your head.

1944
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,080
Well, yes, indeed,
it's in your head,

1945
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,500
but it's also dependent
on interactions

1946
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,440
with your environment.

1947
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,140
Physical environment and
social environment, and so on.

1948
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:31,210
Likewise, gratitude is something
that we can create inside of us

1949
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:33,280
right through gratitude
lists and appreciation,

1950
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,190
or we can give both
powerful sources

1951
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:40,360
of evoking neurochemical changes
associated with gratitude

1952
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,340
and happiness and well-being.

1953
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:45,230
But it, too, doesn't
exist in a vacuum.

1954
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,560
There's a much greater
positive effect

1955
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,557
when we have knowledge about
why the giver is giving us

1956
01:23:51,557 --> 01:23:53,140
something or that
the person receiving

1957
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,210
something is going to benefit
tremendously from receiving it.

1958
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,660
So I'm highlighting
this because I

1959
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:01,570
think that when we hear
about synthetic happiness,

1960
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,650
there's a kind of automatic
erasing of context

1961
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,850
that tends to occur.

1962
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:10,600
And in fact, if you were to
peruse the various videos

1963
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,680
online or papers that exist
on PubMed around happiness

1964
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,450
and synthetic happiness,
in particular,

1965
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,330
you would come away
with the impression

1966
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,080
that synthetic happiness
is just something

1967
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,210
that we're supposed to
snap our fingers in access

1968
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,880
or perhaps do very
specific things in access.

1969
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,760
But while that is true,
context really matters.

1970
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,370
And I think that's
an important point.

1971
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:33,160
Much in the same way
that the point needs

1972
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,280
to be made that while money
doesn't buy happiness,

1973
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,350
money can buffer stress
and certainly offer

1974
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:41,090
opportunities that can
provide opportunities

1975
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:42,180
for more happiness.

1976
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,150
So I think we are starting to
arrive at a general theme here,

1977
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:49,130
which is that nothing related
to our mood exists in isolation.

1978
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:51,350
And in fact, that leads
me to a discussion

1979
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:54,770
of one of the major
scientific findings

1980
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:58,310
in the realm of what sorts
of mindsets and behaviors

1981
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:00,110
can, in fact, lead to happiness.

1982
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:02,705
And this is a paper that
was published in 2008.

1983
01:25:02,705 --> 01:25:04,580
Even though that might
seem like a while ago,

1984
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:07,100
it forms the basis for a
large amount of literature

1985
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:07,892
that followed.

1986
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:09,350
It's a very
interesting literature.

1987
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:13,040
This is work from Elizabeth
Dunn and colleagues

1988
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,970
and was published in
the Journal Science.

1989
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:18,110
Which, again, is one of the sort
of three apex journals, Nature,

1990
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:21,735
Science, Cell, I always say
is sort of the Super Bowl, NBA

1991
01:25:21,735 --> 01:25:24,110
championships, and Stanley
Cup of scientific publishing--

1992
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:27,320
very, very stringent in
terms of the number of papers

1993
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,010
they let in.

1994
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,000
Very few, that is.

1995
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And the title of this
paper makes fairly obvious

1996
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,210
what the paper is about.

1997
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:35,540
The title of the paper
is "spending money

1998
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,490
on others promotes happiness".

1999
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:40,010
And I know a number of you
probably hear that title

2000
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,390
and think, oh boy, here we go.

2001
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:44,000
He's going to tell us that
giving away all our money

2002
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,443
is going to make us happier
than receiving money.

2003
01:25:46,443 --> 01:25:48,860
And I promise you, that is not
what I'm going to tell you.

2004
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:51,080
But nonetheless, this is
a very interesting study,

2005
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,747
and it's one that I
think that we really

2006
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,410
ought to pay attention to.

2007
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:56,780
Because what the
study is based on

2008
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:01,040
is the fact that income,
provided one's income

2009
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,470
meets a certain
level of basic needs,

2010
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:07,760
indeed has been shown to
have only a weak effect

2011
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,110
on overall happiness.

2012
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:10,610
OK?

2013
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:13,040
So quoting from the paper
in the first paragraph,

2014
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,890
quote "income has a reliable
but surprisingly weak

2015
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,140
effect on happiness
within nations".

2016
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,640
Within nations just
mean they looked

2017
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,440
at this in not just
the United States,

2018
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,090
but a number of other
places, as well.

2019
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:26,300
"Particularly once
basic needs are met."

2020
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,630
OK, so if that's the
case, then what aspects

2021
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:32,048
of money and having money
are related to happiness?

2022
01:26:32,048 --> 01:26:34,340
Certainly, there are people
who have a lot of money who

2023
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:35,210
are very happy.

2024
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,890
Certainly, there are people
who have very little money

2025
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:37,760
who are very happy.

2026
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,645
And of course, the
reverse is also true.

2027
01:26:39,645 --> 01:26:42,020
There are plenty of people
who don't have very much money

2028
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:44,060
who are unhappy,
and in fact, there

2029
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:47,360
are people who have a lot of
money who are very unhappy.

2030
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,330
A point that whenever
it's made often

2031
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,720
leads those with less money
to kind of roll their eyes,

2032
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,160
because the assumption is more
money does increase happiness.

2033
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,160
And in fact, it doesn't.

2034
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:03,980
And later, we'll get back to
this idea of whether or how one

2035
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:08,600
acquired their money has
any impact on whether

2036
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,170
or not that money increases
their happiness or not.

2037
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:13,745
Let's kind of earmark
that for later.

2038
01:27:13,745 --> 01:27:15,620
In the meantime, let's
talk a little bit more

2039
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,300
about the findings
in this paper.

2040
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,940
This paper is
interesting, because what

2041
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:23,570
it did is it explored something
called prosocial spending.

2042
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:26,390
Prosocial spending
is a phenomenon

2043
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:28,670
where people are taking
a certain portion

2044
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:32,150
of their income, and they
are giving it to others.

2045
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:35,870
Often for causes or for
things that they think

2046
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,762
are important to see
happen in the world

2047
01:27:37,762 --> 01:27:38,720
or change in the world.

2048
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,510
That could be a hungry
individual having access

2049
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:43,580
to food or medical care.

2050
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,350
It could be for
environmental causes.

2051
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:46,942
It could be for animal wellness.

2052
01:27:46,942 --> 01:27:48,900
It could be for any number
of different things.

2053
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,840
It could even be
giving somebody money

2054
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,780
so that they can buy themselves
a gift or giving somebody money

2055
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:57,620
and not having any understanding
or expectation of what they're

2056
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,270
going to do with the money.

2057
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:02,240
Again, one of the central
themes around gratitude

2058
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:06,680
is that while
receiving is great,

2059
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,700
giving is also great in terms of
increasing sense of well-being.

2060
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,790
And one of the more
important features to that

2061
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:17,720
is when we give, either
in the form of words

2062
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,890
or in the form of
resources, knowledge

2063
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:24,320
that the person
receiving benefits

2064
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,450
from that in some
real way, greatly

2065
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:29,030
increases the
chance that there's

2066
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:33,098
an increase in happiness for the
giver, as well as the receiver.

2067
01:28:33,098 --> 01:28:34,640
Again, that's a note
about gratitude,

2068
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,530
but not an insignificant one
as it relates to the study.

2069
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:40,850
So what the study found was
that higher prosocial spending

2070
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:42,500
was associated
with significantly

2071
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,340
greater happiness.

2072
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:46,160
This was a very statistically
significant effect.

2073
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:49,430
And they found that the
effects of income and prosocial

2074
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:54,398
spending were independent
and similar in magnitude.

2075
01:28:54,398 --> 01:28:55,940
Independent and
similar in magnitude.

2076
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:57,523
I'll explain what
that means for those

2077
01:28:57,523 --> 01:29:00,020
of you that might be confused
by that statement in just

2078
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:00,710
a moment.

2079
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,560
Whereas, quote, "personal
spending remained

2080
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,220
unrelated to happiness".

2081
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:06,770
So what this study
basically found

2082
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:11,240
was if people are allotted
a certain amount of money

2083
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:16,483
to give away, and one
adjusts for overall income,

2084
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:17,900
and this is
important, because you

2085
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:22,430
could imagine that for some
individual giving away $2,000

2086
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:24,620
might represent a
significant portion

2087
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,630
of their yearly
or monthly income.

2088
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:30,110
And for another individual it
might represent a tiny fraction

2089
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,190
of their income.

2090
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:35,540
But when you adjust for
income level, what you find

2091
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,460
is that people who
gave away money

2092
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,970
benefited tremendously in
terms of their own increase

2093
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:44,480
in happiness.

2094
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,890
In fact, quote, "employees who
devoted more of their bonuses

2095
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,810
to prosocial spending,
that is giving way

2096
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:52,540
more money, experience greater
happiness after receiving

2097
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:55,750
the bonus, and the manner in
which they spent that bonus was

2098
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,640
a more important predictor
of their happiness

2099
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,770
than the size of
the bonus itself".

2100
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,360
This was an actual
experiment they ran

2101
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,065
with real income, real money.

2102
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,440
I'm going to read
that again just

2103
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,190
to make sure it hits
home, because I found

2104
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:10,130
this to be really impactful.

2105
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:14,000
"Employees who devoted a
greater fraction of their bonus

2106
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,560
to prosocial spending, that is
giving away money to others,

2107
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,800
experienced greater happiness
after receiving the bonus.

2108
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,390
And the manner in
which they spent

2109
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:26,150
that bonus was a more important
predictor of their happiness

2110
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:27,870
than the size of
the bonus itself."

2111
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:30,740
So the actual bonus, the
receiving of the money,

2112
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:35,630
led to greater increases in
happiness if they gave it away.

2113
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:39,080
And the act of giving
it away itself,

2114
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,360
led to greater
increases in happiness

2115
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,440
than receiving the bonus.

2116
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,620
So it's a twofer,
as you might say.

2117
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,650
So the takeaway from this
study and studies like it,

2118
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:51,780
I think is pretty obvious that
to the extent that we can.

2119
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,990
And again, when I say to
the extent that we can,

2120
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:57,590
this means whatever
percentage of our own income

2121
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:00,960
that we can afford to give away,
or if we don't have income,

2122
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,990
the percentage of our effort.

2123
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:05,390
I mean this is about money,
but it's also about effort.

2124
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:06,740
We can help others, right?

2125
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:11,990
You can serve in food kitchens,
you can do community gardening,

2126
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:15,200
you can pick up trash, you
can do any number of things.

2127
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,540
You can assist a
neighbor with child care

2128
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:20,360
or you can assist a neighbor
who is physically less

2129
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,910
able to retrieve their
paper, et cetera, et cetera.

2130
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,660
The point is that
giving resources,

2131
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:30,680
certainly in the form of money,
but also in the form of effort

2132
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:34,910
and time, is immensely
beneficial for synthesizing

2133
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:36,230
our own happiness.

2134
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:38,990
That is for the
giver, us, to increase

2135
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,250
our levels of happiness.

2136
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,670
But the degree of increase
in our own happiness

2137
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:47,360
is proportional in
some way to the extent

2138
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,080
to which the person receiving
actually needed that help

2139
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,670
and registers that help.

2140
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:55,220
Excellent research
also points to the fact

2141
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:58,130
that another potent
way to synthesize

2142
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:01,250
happiness, that is to create
genuine states of happiness

2143
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:05,660
in ourselves, is to leverage
the so-called focus system.

2144
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:09,320
Or rather, I should say to
de-emphasize the tendency

2145
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,107
of our minds to wander.

2146
01:32:11,107 --> 01:32:13,190
There's an excellent paper
on this, also published

2147
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,148
in the Journal Science.

2148
01:32:14,148 --> 01:32:15,380
This is now a classic paper.

2149
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:17,880
I talked a little bit about it
in the episode on meditation,

2150
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,910
but for those of you
that did or perhaps

2151
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:22,820
didn't hear that episode, I
just want to briefly touch

2152
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:25,310
on a few aspects of the paper.

2153
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:29,102
And in particular, a few aspects
of the paper that I didn't talk

2154
01:32:29,102 --> 01:32:29,810
about previously.

2155
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:31,640
And the title of
this paper, again,

2156
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,140
is a very
straightforward in terms

2157
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:34,550
of telling you what it's about.

2158
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:38,570
And that is, "A wandering
mind is an unhappy mind"

2159
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:40,640
by Killingsworth and Gilbert.

2160
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,663
This paper was published
in Science in 2010,

2161
01:32:42,663 --> 01:32:44,330
and we will provide
a link to the paper.

2162
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:46,550
This is frankly, a
very interesting paper.

2163
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,920
This paper involved
several subjects,

2164
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:52,340
or I should say,
2,250 adult subjects.

2165
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,230
And what they were
able to do was

2166
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:55,730
to contact these
subjects while they

2167
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:58,070
were going about living
their daily lives

2168
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,170
and ask them both
what they were doing

2169
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:01,602
and what they were feeling.

2170
01:33:01,602 --> 01:33:03,560
Some additional questions
that they asked them,

2171
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,500
but they were able to
establish whether or not

2172
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:10,550
people were watching television
or doing housework or working

2173
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:14,600
on a home computer or resting or
listening to music, et cetera,

2174
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,930
in their natural environment.

2175
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:17,510
So this is outside
the laboratory.

2176
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:21,080
And they were able to
assess to what extent

2177
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:25,490
those people were happy
or unhappy or neutral,

2178
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,977
or had some other
emotional state at the time

2179
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:30,560
when they were engaging in any
number of different activities.

2180
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,880
And they assessed whether or
not those individuals were also

2181
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,000
focused on or focused away
from whatever activity they

2182
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,960
were engaging in.

2183
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,030
And the takeaways from
this study are many,

2184
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:44,180
but for sake of today's
discussion, what

2185
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:46,340
I think is especially
interesting

2186
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:49,280
is that regardless
of whether or not

2187
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,460
people were engaging in
activities that they enjoyed

2188
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:57,770
or not, the tendency for their
mind to wander from an activity

2189
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,990
predicted lower
levels of happiness

2190
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:02,180
than if they tended to be
focused on the activity

2191
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,710
they were engaged in.

2192
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:06,480
Now that itself
should be surprising.

2193
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,200
I mean, what that says
is that even if somebody

2194
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,600
was engaged in activity
like cleaning their house

2195
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,600
or doing homework or reading
something that they weren't

2196
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,090
enjoying, if they were focused
on what they were doing,

2197
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:22,730
they tended to report as happier
than if their mind was drifting

2198
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:23,610
elsewhere.

2199
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,570
Now this also points to the
idea that perhaps our minds

2200
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:29,090
drift to unpleasant thoughts
more than pleasant thoughts.

2201
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:31,430
But they also addressed
that in the study.

2202
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:32,930
Point I'd like to
make here is quote

2203
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:34,430
"although people's
minds were more

2204
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:37,430
likely to wander
to pleasant topics

2205
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:39,753
than to unpleasant topics"
and there the difference

2206
01:34:39,753 --> 01:34:40,670
is pretty significant.

2207
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:44,180
People's minds tended to
wander to pleasant topics

2208
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:48,080
about 43% of the time as
opposed to unpleasant topics

2209
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,910
about 27% of the time.

2210
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:54,020
Or to neutral topics and the
remaining 31% of samples.

2211
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:56,300
"People were no
happier when thinking

2212
01:34:56,300 --> 01:35:00,600
about pleasant topics than
about their current activity".

2213
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,620
Think about that.

2214
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:03,180
"People were no
happier than when

2215
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:06,250
thinking about pleasant things
then their current activity".

2216
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:09,600
In fact, the mere focus
on what they were doing

2217
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,970
was more powerful
than anything else,

2218
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:15,310
even if they didn't enjoy
what they were doing.

2219
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:17,970
So they go on here to say, quote
"although negative moods are

2220
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:20,400
known to cause mind
wandering, I now

2221
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,280
see strongly suggested that
mind wandering was generally

2222
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,920
the cause, the
cause, and not merely

2223
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,090
the consequence of unhappiness."

2224
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:30,090
So there are a lot of
aspects of this study that

2225
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:31,320
are worth going into.

2226
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:35,100
But the major takeaway, or the
one that perhaps we should all

2227
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,980
be most concerned with,
is that when we are not

2228
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:39,660
focused on what we
are doing, we tend

2229
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:41,880
to be far less happy
than when we are

2230
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,237
focused on what we are doing.

2231
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,820
Even if what we are
doing is something

2232
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,395
that we don't deem
very pleasant.

2233
01:35:46,395 --> 01:35:48,270
And certainly, if we
are engaged in something

2234
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:50,837
that we consider very pleasant
and we are very focused on,

2235
01:35:50,837 --> 01:35:52,920
well then our levels of
happiness are the highest.

2236
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,120
That's sort of obvious.

2237
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,630
But what this really speaks
to is the tremendous power

2238
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:01,620
of building our ability to
focus on what we're doing.

2239
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:03,493
And to stay present
to what we are doing.

2240
01:36:03,493 --> 01:36:05,160
Now this whole notion
of staying present

2241
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,390
is one that itself is a
little bit complicated.

2242
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:09,930
And in the episode on meditation
I talked a little bit about

2243
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,850
whether or not it's
beneficial to be

2244
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:15,180
present to our
internal state, or that

2245
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:17,340
is our inter receptive state.

2246
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:21,600
Our feelings of our heart
rate and how full or empty

2247
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,350
our gut feels or our state of
being from our skin inward,

2248
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:26,965
or whether or not
we should focus

2249
01:36:26,965 --> 01:36:29,340
on being present to things in
our immediate surroundings.

2250
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,750
Both our versions
of being quote,

2251
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:33,100
unquote "present"
as you can imagine.

2252
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,940
But in the one case,
we're focused internally,

2253
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,710
in the other we're
focused externally,

2254
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:39,210
and of course, most
of the time it's

2255
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,493
some combination of the two.

2256
01:36:40,493 --> 01:36:41,910
But what this study
really says is

2257
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:45,630
that any practice that can
powerfully impact our ability

2258
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:49,955
to remain present in the
activity we are engaged in,

2259
01:36:49,955 --> 01:36:51,330
could even be a
phone call, could

2260
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:54,032
be texting for that matter,
could be social media

2261
01:36:54,032 --> 01:36:54,990
for that matter, right?

2262
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:57,100
We're not placing judgment
on the activity here.

2263
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,767
In fact, what we're
really talking about

2264
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:02,040
is the enormous happiness
increasing value

2265
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,680
of being present to what
we're doing regardless

2266
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,880
of what we are doing.

2267
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,940
And a practice that's known to
be beneficial for increasing

2268
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:12,760
our ability to focus
is, among other things,

2269
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,310
a short meditation practice.

2270
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:18,120
In fact, work from Wendy
Suzuki's lab at NYU,

2271
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,130
again, Wendy's been a
guest on this podcast.

2272
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:22,020
Her laboratory has
shown that even

2273
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:25,110
a very brief meditation
of about 13 minutes,

2274
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:26,970
and this would be the
sort of quote unquote

2275
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:29,070
"classic" type of
meditation of eyes

2276
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:31,020
closed, focusing
on one's breathing.

2277
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,750
Even a very brief meditation
of just 13 minutes

2278
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:38,310
or so done consistently,
so ideally, every day.

2279
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,900
But I have to imagine that
even if you skip a day,

2280
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,120
there are still benefits.

2281
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,370
That sort of
meditation can greatly

2282
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:45,990
enhance one's ability to focus.

2283
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:48,060
In her studies,
that was also shown

2284
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:52,020
that sort of brief meditation
could also greatly enhance

2285
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,698
mood and sleep and
various aspects

2286
01:37:54,698 --> 01:37:55,740
of cognitive performance.

2287
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:58,500
And work from my laboratory,
in collaboration with Dr. David

2288
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,990
Spiegel at Stanford,
department of psychiatry

2289
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:04,210
has shown that even briefer
meditations of even just five

2290
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:07,620
minutes per day can have fairly
outsized positive effects

2291
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,660
on a number of different
parameters, as well.

2292
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:12,360
Those very brief
types of meditations,

2293
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,960
because they really are
focusing and more accurately,

2294
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,240
I should say,
refocusing exercises.

2295
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,090
When you do that sort of
activity of closing your eyes

2296
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:23,610
and forcing yourself
to focus and refocus

2297
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:25,560
on your breath and
internal state,

2298
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,360
that is directing your
perception inward.

2299
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,390
Or if you choose, you
could deliberately

2300
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:32,790
focus your perception
on some external object

2301
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:36,060
or sound, for that matter.

2302
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:39,720
When one does that, the circuits
of the brain involved in focus

2303
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,490
dramatically improve.

2304
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:45,300
That is they rewire and
increase their ability for you

2305
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,370
to achieve focus.

2306
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:49,770
Many of us have heard about
meditation, many of us

2307
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:53,130
think about meditation as
a "mindfulness" exercise.

2308
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:55,710
Mindfulness in quotes, because
that itself needs definition.

2309
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:59,550
But I prefer to view
meditations of the sort

2310
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:02,700
that I just described
as perceptual or focus

2311
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:06,480
based training, which is
really what the data point to.

2312
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,460
Notions around consciousness
and states of mind

2313
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:12,030
are very hard to define, but
it's very clear that even

2314
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,300
a 5 minute a day or ideally,
an up to a 13 minute a day

2315
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:18,600
meditation can greatly
increase our ability to focus.

2316
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,090
And based on the
findings in this paper,

2317
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:24,720
"A wandering mind is an unhappy
mind" also make it very clear

2318
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,260
that the ability to
refocus again and again

2319
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:31,260
and again on what we're
doing throughout our day,

2320
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,240
regardless of what
we're doing, can

2321
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:37,530
have a very dramatic, in fact,
a statistically significant

2322
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:40,057
increase on our levels
of overall happiness.

2323
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,640
So what else does
the research tell us

2324
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,360
we can do to increase our
levels of genuine happiness?

2325
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,660
Well, it's very clear based
on the longitudinal study

2326
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:51,780
from Harvard, as well
as the Yale happiness

2327
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:55,230
project and the work of
numerous laboratories in the US

2328
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:59,410
and elsewhere, that
quality social connection

2329
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,860
is extremely powerful
in terms of its ability

2330
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:05,560
to increase our
levels of happiness.

2331
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,780
What is quality
social connection?

2332
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:10,750
Quality social connection
falls into a number

2333
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,740
of different bins.

2334
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:14,770
This can be romantic connection,
this can be friendship,

2335
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,990
this can even be
coworker or just

2336
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:20,470
daily superficial
interaction type connections.

2337
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:22,447
That's surprising
to a lot of people,

2338
01:40:22,447 --> 01:40:25,030
because I think a lot of people
hear quality social connection

2339
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:27,100
and they think
deep conversation.

2340
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,500
But it's very clear
from the research

2341
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:33,040
that oftentimes our
conversations with people

2342
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,163
that we are closest to are
actually quite shallow.

2343
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:38,830
If you think about it, if you've
been in a romantic relationship

2344
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:40,670
or a friendship for a
long period of time,

2345
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:42,880
or maybe even a sibling
relationship or other family

2346
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,790
relationship, much of
what you talk about

2347
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:49,730
is fairly superficial
or fairly trivial.

2348
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:52,330
In fact, it's often a
sharing of the trivial day

2349
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:55,780
to day things between two
people or through groups

2350
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:58,300
of people that
leads to the feeling

2351
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,460
that people are really
connected to one another.

2352
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:03,820
In particular, if it's involving
shared experiences of any kind,

2353
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:05,480
good or bad.

2354
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:08,320
So there's an extensive
literature on social connection

2355
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,910
and how to build
social connection.

2356
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:11,530
This certainly
should be the topic

2357
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:13,520
of a full episode
of this podcast

2358
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,050
in the not too distant future.

2359
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:18,340
But because social connection
can have such a powerful impact

2360
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:21,790
on our states of happiness
and overall well-being,

2361
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:25,150
I want to emphasize a few
features of social connection

2362
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,400
that I think most people
might not appreciate.

2363
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,140
Once again, when we hear
quality social connection,

2364
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:32,860
I think most of us tend to
think about deep, meaningful

2365
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:36,160
conversation or long walks
on the beach or camping trips

2366
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,520
together or travel together.

2367
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,460
And while all of those
certainly qualify

2368
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:43,240
as wonderful opportunities
for social connection,

2369
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,490
opportunities for
quality social connection

2370
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:48,530
are certainly not limited to
those kinds of interactions.

2371
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:52,250
In fact, I can recall times
in my graduate career,

2372
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,880
so this would be times when I
was living in the laboratory.

2373
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,790
Because that was a significant
portion of my graduate years.

2374
01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:01,030
And one of the more important
social connections for me

2375
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:04,960
was the staff that worked there
in the wee hours of the night

2376
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,890
and that came in very
early in the morning.

2377
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:09,940
So one of the more regular
social connections I had is I

2378
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:13,180
would brush my teeth in
the hallway bathroom.

2379
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:16,040
And there was no one else
really around at that time,

2380
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,830
except for the
janitors that tended

2381
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:19,480
to leave early in the morning.

2382
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,370
They had worked a good
portion of the night.

2383
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:23,662
Or that were arriving
very early in the day.

2384
01:42:23,662 --> 01:42:25,870
And the fact that I would
see them on a regular basis

2385
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:27,670
and maybe exchange a few
words about their work

2386
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:29,920
or their families or the
holidays, actually for me,

2387
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,420
became very meaningful.

2388
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,820
In part, because my social
connections at the time

2389
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,160
were really limited to
only social connections

2390
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,380
that I had in the
context of work.

2391
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:41,290
Now some people might look
at my schedule at that time

2392
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:43,310
and look at my life at
that time and say, well,

2393
01:42:43,310 --> 01:42:44,680
that was very unhealthy.

2394
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,350
You were lacking in
certain number of ways.

2395
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:49,870
But frankly, looking
back, and at the time,

2396
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:52,030
and I know this because
I journaled at the time,

2397
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:53,860
I was exceedingly
happy, at least

2398
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:55,270
for that stage of my life.

2399
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,860
At that stage of
my life, I wanted

2400
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:01,600
to be focused primarily on
doing experiments and immersing

2401
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,940
myself in my
scientific training.

2402
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:07,930
And for me, the even seemingly
insignificant interactions

2403
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:11,030
of talking to the
janitor in the morning

2404
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:13,850
or some of the other regular
staff was not insignificant.

2405
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:15,680
In fact, for me it
was very significant.

2406
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,990
And over the holidays when
their hours were reduced,

2407
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:19,580
I actually missed
them quite a lot.

2408
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,080
And even as I talk
about this, I can

2409
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:22,700
recall the feelings
of well-being

2410
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:24,377
of just seeing familiar faces.

2411
01:43:24,377 --> 01:43:26,210
And that brings up an
important point, which

2412
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:30,200
is there's quite extensive
literature pointing to the fact

2413
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:34,370
that when we see faces,
especially faces in the morning

2414
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:38,750
and in the late afternoon,
there is a positive impact

2415
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,290
on the emotional circuitry.

2416
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:42,290
Or I should say, the
circuitry of the brain that

2417
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:44,390
underlies emotional well-being.

2418
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:46,430
And that shouldn't
come as surprising.

2419
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:50,150
We as old world primates,
much like other primates,

2420
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:53,810
are very dependent on faces
and facial expressions

2421
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:57,330
in terms of registering
our own place in life

2422
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:59,210
and our emotional state.

2423
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:00,950
Now the origins
of this are many.

2424
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:03,440
In particular, we
have a brain area,

2425
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,425
it's actually called
the fusiform face gyrus.

2426
01:44:05,425 --> 01:44:06,800
This is an area
of the brain that

2427
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,380
was largely
discovered by a woman

2428
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:11,510
by Nancy Kanwisher at MIT.

2429
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:14,360
And the Kanwisher lab
has done extensive work

2430
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:16,760
showing that this
brain area that's

2431
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:21,410
dedicated to the processing
of faces, and not just faces

2432
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:24,470
in real life, but faces
on computer screens

2433
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:27,200
and elsewhere, are
intimately tied

2434
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,780
to areas of the brain that are
associated with emotionality.

2435
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,738
That's actually a work
from another laboratory,

2436
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:34,190
Dorsal's laboratory at
Caltech, now at Uc Berkeley,

2437
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,380
has shown that this
face processing

2438
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:41,240
area in the brain in both
non-human primates and primates

2439
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:44,660
is directly linked to
the areas of our brain

2440
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,180
that associate with
anxiety and fear.

2441
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:48,590
But also, areas
of the brain that

2442
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:50,030
are associated with well-being.

2443
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:51,770
So it comes as no
surprise that when

2444
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:53,990
we see faces, in
particular, friendly faces,

2445
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:56,780
even if we have just brief
interactions with those faces,

2446
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,970
and even if no
words are exchanged,

2447
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:01,430
that creates the
sense of social bond.

2448
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:03,650
And it creates a sense
of predictability.

2449
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:05,900
And I raise this again because
I think a lot of people

2450
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,610
think that social
connection always

2451
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:10,630
has to come in the form of
close friendships, which

2452
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:11,630
of course are wonderful.

2453
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:14,030
Or close romantic relationships,
which of course, are wonderful.

2454
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:16,770
Or close family relationships,
which of course, are wonderful.

2455
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:20,480
But as we'll soon discuss
in our model of happiness,

2456
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,070
or how to achieve
happiness based

2457
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:25,790
on the scientific
literature in a few minutes,

2458
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:29,720
social connection can and
should come in various forms.

2459
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,640
And when I say
various forms, I mean

2460
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:35,480
forms of brief interaction,
more superficial interaction,

2461
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,060
and forms of deeper interaction.

2462
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:40,520
All of those are relevant
to our states of happiness.

2463
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:43,850
And there's research to
support that daily interactions

2464
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:47,900
with somebody at a cafe or
just a brief hello or a smile.

2465
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,060
Provided that we
are both present,

2466
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:53,070
or we make the effort to be
present to those interactions,

2467
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:55,940
however brief they are,
can have a positive effect

2468
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,260
on people's overall well-being.

2469
01:45:57,260 --> 01:46:00,470
And not just in that
moment, but consistently.

2470
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:02,210
Evidenced by the
fact, I think, that

2471
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:04,340
when I look back on
those years of working

2472
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:08,270
long hours in the laboratory and
essentially restricting myself

2473
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:12,680
either to exercising,
sleeping, eating or working.

2474
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,170
Again, that's what I wanted
at that stage of my life.

2475
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,920
Certainly, not the way
I live my life now.

2476
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,080
But that's what I wanted
that stage of my life.

2477
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,410
That even those
seemingly insignificant

2478
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:24,230
social interactions
were important to me

2479
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:26,690
and had a potent
impact on increasing

2480
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:27,620
my level of happiness.

2481
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:28,770
And frankly, still do.

2482
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:30,380
And I feel that right now.

2483
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,980
That said, I think all of us
can appreciate the immense value

2484
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:38,090
of social connection that is of
the more long lasting, and for

2485
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:39,930
lack of a better
word, richer type,

2486
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:43,250
whether or not that is with
siblings or with parents

2487
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:45,920
or with friends or
with romantic partners.

2488
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,320
For that reason, I want
to emphasize a little bit

2489
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,780
about what
constitutes connection

2490
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:52,430
and what constitutes
social connection.

2491
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:54,560
There are basically two
forms of social connection

2492
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,110
that have been studied
and I'll review both,

2493
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:59,600
as it relates to increasing
our levels of happiness.

2494
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,480
And the first one is
presence and eye contact,

2495
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,680
and the second is
physical contact.

2496
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:06,710
So in terms of presence
and eye contact

2497
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:08,840
there's been a lot
of studies about

2498
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:11,900
whether or not people
exchange direct eye contact

2499
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:15,230
during conversation or not,
dictating whether or not

2500
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:18,380
each individual in
that interaction

2501
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:21,050
feels as if they
had a connection.

2502
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:24,230
Now again, keep in mind that
while we think of connection

2503
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:26,870
as relating to some deep
or meaningful conversation,

2504
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:28,370
and oftentimes that
can be the case.

2505
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:32,990
Think for instance, an excellent
therapist patient relationship.

2506
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:35,180
Or an excellent
romantic relationship.

2507
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:38,300
Or an excellent friendship
where you really feel

2508
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,460
heard and understood, or
at least to the extent

2509
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,190
that people are
willing to explore

2510
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:43,190
certain topics with you.

2511
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:45,065
You're willing to hear
them and listen really

2512
01:47:45,065 --> 01:47:46,482
carefully for what
they're saying,

2513
01:47:46,482 --> 01:47:49,040
and they're willing to hear and
listen to what you're saying

2514
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,570
in an attempt to understand.

2515
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:53,060
That certainly can enhance
the sense of social connection

2516
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:55,940
leading to what people would
call social bonds leading

2517
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:57,410
to increased happiness.

2518
01:47:57,410 --> 01:48:02,030
But eye contact is also known
to be an important feature.

2519
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:04,130
The thing about eye
contact is that most people

2520
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:06,440
assume that a lot
of eye contact,

2521
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,420
and in fact,
ongoing eye contact,

2522
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:11,570
is critical to a
sense of connection.

2523
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:13,250
And in fact, that's
not the case.

2524
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:16,577
There's a recent paper that I
find really interesting that

2525
01:48:16,577 --> 01:48:18,410
was published in
Proceedings of the National

2526
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:21,140
Academy of Sciences in 2021.

2527
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:23,330
The title of this
paper is "Eye contact

2528
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:25,640
marks the rise and fall
of shared attention

2529
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:26,670
in conversation".

2530
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:28,920
I find this paper interesting
for a number of reasons.

2531
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,790
First of all, my laboratory
works on internal states

2532
01:48:31,790 --> 01:48:33,380
and vision, so it
relates directly

2533
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,210
to the work that
my laboratory does.

2534
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:37,970
But also, that it
violates what I thought

2535
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:40,490
was a general rule of
social connection, which

2536
01:48:40,490 --> 01:48:42,980
is this idea that two people
needed to be focused on one

2537
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:45,230
another, that is
looking at one another

2538
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:48,740
directly and fairly consistently
throughout a conversation

2539
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,170
in order for the feeling
of connection to emerge.

2540
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:53,335
But it turns out
that's not the case.

2541
01:48:53,335 --> 01:48:55,460
And in fact, just to give
you the takeaway and then

2542
01:48:55,460 --> 01:49:00,290
I'll flesh it out a little bit
with some data, eye contact,

2543
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:03,448
or I should say mutual
eye contact, so two people

2544
01:49:03,448 --> 01:49:05,990
registering the presence of the
other person looking at them.

2545
01:49:05,990 --> 01:49:07,640
You're looking at me
and I'm looking at you.

2546
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,098
If you're watching
this on YouTube,

2547
01:49:09,098 --> 01:49:12,223
then perhaps we are actually
doing this at that moment.

2548
01:49:12,223 --> 01:49:13,640
And if you're
listening, just know

2549
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,050
that I'm looking
directly into the camera

2550
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,467
as I'm saying this
at this moment.

2551
01:49:16,467 --> 01:49:19,820
If we were to be looking
directly at one another,

2552
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:23,640
that, it turns out,
signals the next step,

2553
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:27,290
which is that it's very likely
that we will each both look

2554
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,350
away.

2555
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:31,490
And that turns out to
be a way in which we set

2556
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:35,083
and reset attention continually
during conversation.

2557
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:36,500
So again, I really
like this study

2558
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,730
because of the high fidelity.

2559
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:40,520
The high temporal precision.

2560
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,770
That is, the precision
over time at which they

2561
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:48,020
looked at eye contact and
engagement of attention

2562
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,340
between individuals.

2563
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,955
And they did this by looking
at things like pupil size

2564
01:49:51,955 --> 01:49:53,330
and of course
where the eyes were

2565
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:54,665
looking and so on and so forth.

2566
01:49:54,665 --> 01:49:56,790
The basic takeaway of this
study was the following.

2567
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:58,290
And here I'm quoting
from the study.

2568
01:49:58,290 --> 01:50:01,490
Quote "Rather than
maximizing shared attention,

2569
01:50:01,490 --> 01:50:03,770
good conversation
may require shifts

2570
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:07,520
in and out of shared states
accompanied by eye contact".

2571
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:10,610
So what this basically
says is that when

2572
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:13,125
two people are
involved in a very,

2573
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:14,750
let's call it an
intimate conversation,

2574
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:17,690
but the word intimate
should not be misconstrued

2575
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:20,330
to mean something about
intimacy or sexual intimacy

2576
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:21,710
or physical intimacy.

2577
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:23,990
Just a conversation
in which both people

2578
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:27,320
feel present to the
conversation and focused

2579
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:30,020
on that conversation and that
conversation and its contents

2580
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:30,950
only.

2581
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:33,840
The tendency is for people
to take turns talking,

2582
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,840
although sometimes,
depending on the individuals

2583
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:37,580
they might interrupt
more or less.

2584
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:40,370
Again, interrupting can
be a sign of interest,

2585
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:42,630
it doesn't always have
to be rude, by the way.

2586
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:45,290
But they're sharing information.

2587
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:48,500
Hopefully, about a common
topic or set of topics.

2588
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:51,503
They will at some moment
look at one another.

2589
01:50:51,503 --> 01:50:52,670
That's what the study shows.

2590
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:55,700
And that after briefly
gazing directly at one

2591
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:59,810
another, attention peaks,
and then they will look away,

2592
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:01,670
and attention will get reduced.

2593
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:03,740
And then the
conversation consists

2594
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:08,510
of a series of focusing back
on one another with their eyes,

2595
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:10,940
and then focusing off,
focusing on and focusing off.

2596
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:13,940
And those mutual
eye contact moments

2597
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:16,730
actually predict the
breaking of attention.

2598
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:18,858
So it's this ramping up
of attention and braking

2599
01:51:18,858 --> 01:51:19,400
of attention.

2600
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,560
Ramping of attention and
braking of attention.

2601
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:23,960
I think these are important
results because they violate

2602
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,680
this stereotype or assumption
that deep social connection

2603
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:31,040
of the sort leading
to happiness always

2604
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,180
involves ongoing eye
contact or ongoing focus.

2605
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:39,650
Just as with meditation, just
as with any activity, frankly,

2606
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:43,580
we undergo shifts in
attention and focus.

2607
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:46,550
That is focus ramps up and
then it breaks, and then

2608
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:47,240
it re-engages.

2609
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,880
It ramps up it breaks,
and then it re-engages.

2610
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:52,280
And that, it turns
out, is the basis

2611
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:55,170
of in-depth connected
conversation.

2612
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:57,650
So for those of you that
are interested in creating

2613
01:51:57,650 --> 01:52:01,110
social connection
in any context,

2614
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:04,020
and in particular for sake
of increasing happiness,

2615
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,750
because it's very clear
that social connections,

2616
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:09,390
even if they are fairly
superficial social connections,

2617
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,340
can increase our
sense of happiness.

2618
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:13,290
Seeing faces is important.

2619
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:16,080
Ideally, faces in person,
although I suppose these days,

2620
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,530
over Zoom or over other
screen type medium

2621
01:52:19,530 --> 01:52:21,610
would be a close second.

2622
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:25,470
But the point is that if you
want to increase happiness

2623
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:27,303
you need to have quality
social connections.

2624
01:52:27,303 --> 01:52:29,387
And if you want to have
quality social connections

2625
01:52:29,387 --> 01:52:31,053
you need to be
present and engage

2626
01:52:31,053 --> 01:52:32,220
in those social connections.

2627
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:36,330
And that requires a viewing
of each other's faces,

2628
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:39,420
ideally, which is not to say
that a phone call or text

2629
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,140
exchange can't be meaningful.

2630
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:44,070
But that faces are really
the most powerful way

2631
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:45,990
to engage in social contact.

2632
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:49,560
And that eye contact, not
consistent eye contact,

2633
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,080
but eye contact of the sort
that builds up and then breaks

2634
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,090
and builds up and breaks
across the interaction

2635
01:52:54,090 --> 01:52:59,460
is going to be the best way
that we are aware of to feel

2636
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,410
that one had a real connection.

2637
01:53:01,410 --> 01:53:02,910
This should also
remove any pressure

2638
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,580
that you might feel to
constantly look at somebody

2639
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:08,095
or to be completely eyes
open staring at them

2640
01:53:08,095 --> 01:53:10,470
without blinking or diverting
your attention at any point

2641
01:53:10,470 --> 01:53:11,850
during a conversation.

2642
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:14,070
This also frankly,
is an opportunity

2643
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:17,610
where if somebody says, hey,
you're not paying attention

2644
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:20,670
because you look away,
that you may actually

2645
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:22,860
be engaging in what is
the more typical form

2646
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:23,910
of healthy connection.

2647
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:26,693
I talked about this long ago
on an episode about focus.

2648
01:53:26,693 --> 01:53:28,110
It turns out when
we are listening

2649
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:29,872
very intently to
somebody and trying

2650
01:53:29,872 --> 01:53:31,830
to remember the information
they're telling us,

2651
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:33,332
we will often close our eyes.

2652
01:53:33,332 --> 01:53:35,790
And that's not a form of lack
of attention, that's actually

2653
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:37,050
a form of attending in.

2654
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:40,410
Because we have so much of
our brain devoted to vision.

2655
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:42,870
When 40% of our brain
is devoted to vision

2656
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:44,890
in some way or another,
when we close our eyes,

2657
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:47,280
we can actually devote
more attentional resources

2658
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:50,250
to remembering the specifics
of what people are telling us.

2659
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:52,620
But again, please don't
go through conversations

2660
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:54,310
with your eyes closed
the entire time.

2661
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:57,390
I think that would certainly
not be conducive to building

2662
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:58,330
social connection.

2663
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:01,710
So we know that faces are
important for social connection

2664
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,290
as it relates to
synthetic happiness.

2665
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:07,320
And we know that eye contact is
really important for building

2666
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,670
social connection.

2667
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:12,520
Physical contact
is also important

2668
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:13,540
for social connection.

2669
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:17,000
And not just romantic or
sexual type connection.

2670
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,480
In fact, there is a form
of physical connection

2671
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:22,840
that is present
in other primates.

2672
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,960
In fact, it's present as far
as we know, in all mammals.

2673
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:31,060
And is also very much a feature
of the human nervous system.

2674
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:32,868
And that's something
called allogrooming.

2675
01:54:32,868 --> 01:54:34,660
I have to imagine that
most people probably

2676
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:36,077
haven't heard of allogrooming.

2677
01:54:36,077 --> 01:54:37,660
The reason I'm
bringing up alogrooming

2678
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:41,080
is that it stems from a
fairly extensive literature

2679
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:45,310
about the prosocial,
pro happiness

2680
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:47,783
effects of pets on humans.

2681
01:54:47,783 --> 01:54:49,450
In fact, if you want
to read up on this,

2682
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:52,810
there is a paper out of Yale
University on this topic

2683
01:54:52,810 --> 01:54:53,980
that was published in 2018.

2684
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:56,313
The title of the paper is
"The influence of interactions

2685
01:54:56,313 --> 01:55:00,368
with dogs on affect", OK
emotion, "anxety and arousal

2686
01:55:00,368 --> 01:55:00,910
in children".

2687
01:55:00,910 --> 01:55:02,570
And it references
some other studies

2688
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:03,820
that were performed on humans.

2689
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:07,270
And the basic takeaway is
that these so-called AAAs,

2690
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:12,010
animal assisted activities,
represent a really potent way

2691
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:15,430
to increase people,
including children's feelings

2692
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:16,210
of well-being.

2693
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:18,580
Now what's interesting
about this to me

2694
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:22,000
is that dogs
themselves don't really

2695
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,990
have to do much except be
present in the room in order

2696
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:29,860
for these positive effects, that
is, the reductions in anxiety,

2697
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:32,200
increases in happiness,
et cetera, to occur.

2698
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,317
And in fact, they can
be very, very brief.

2699
01:55:34,317 --> 01:55:36,400
As they describe in the
paper, "brief unstructured

2700
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,140
interactions with
an unfamiliar dog",

2701
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:40,030
so you don't even
need to know this dog,

2702
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:43,300
"after exposure to a moderate
stressor showed higher positive

2703
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:46,690
affect relevant to participants
who received a soothing object

2704
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,530
or waited for the
same amount of time."

2705
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:52,240
So just even seeing a dog
for a brief amount of time

2706
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:56,260
has been shown to reduce
stress and improve happiness,

2707
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:57,910
or I should say,
increase feelings

2708
01:55:57,910 --> 01:56:01,660
of happiness
overall then a child

2709
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:03,293
receiving a soothing object.

2710
01:56:03,293 --> 01:56:05,710
Which was, at least for me, a
little bit counterintuitive.

2711
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:07,030
I would have thought
that children receiving

2712
01:56:07,030 --> 01:56:08,405
a soothing object
would have been

2713
01:56:08,405 --> 01:56:10,760
the more powerful stimulus.

2714
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:13,198
But in fact, it wasn't, at
least not in this study.

2715
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:15,490
The real question I think we
should be asking ourselves

2716
01:56:15,490 --> 01:56:18,520
is, what is it about
interactions with others

2717
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:21,220
and with other animals
that could potentially

2718
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:24,950
have this prosocial
happiness enhancing effect?

2719
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:27,100
And the reason I
raise this is also

2720
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:31,660
because I think many people
are interested in either owning

2721
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:33,992
or having interactions with
pets as a way to improve

2722
01:56:33,992 --> 01:56:35,200
their feelings of well-being.

2723
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,350
And I say having
interactions with because I

2724
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:40,840
myself am a good example
of somebody who wasn't

2725
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:43,183
always able to have pets.

2726
01:56:43,183 --> 01:56:45,100
So when I was a graduate
student in a postdoc,

2727
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,672
I very much wanted a dog.

2728
01:56:46,672 --> 01:56:48,130
Very, very, very
much wanted a dog.

2729
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:50,297
In fact, there was a rule
in my family at some point

2730
01:56:50,297 --> 01:56:53,172
that I wasn't allowed to talk
about dogs anymore because I

2731
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:54,880
was talking about all
the breeds of dogs.

2732
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,270
Going to dog breeders,
examining different breeds,

2733
01:56:58,270 --> 01:57:00,310
going to the pound, et cetera.

2734
01:57:00,310 --> 01:57:03,430
The point was that I was
obsessed with getting a dog,

2735
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:05,800
but I knew I wasn't in a good
position to own a dog yet.

2736
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:08,300
I didn't have the finances, I
didn't have the correct living

2737
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:10,270
situation and so on.

2738
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:12,335
Eventually, I did
own a dog, of course.

2739
01:57:12,335 --> 01:57:13,460
But at the time I couldn't.

2740
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,952
So what I would do is every
Sunday I would go to a place

2741
01:57:15,952 --> 01:57:18,160
where they fostered dogs
and they needed dog walkers.

2742
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,285
And I would walk their dog.

2743
01:57:19,285 --> 01:57:22,330
I would also walk
my neighbor's dogs.

2744
01:57:22,330 --> 01:57:23,540
I didn't charge them for it.

2745
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:26,140
In fact, I felt like I was
being paid by getting time

2746
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:27,040
with those dogs.

2747
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,500
And in fact, I put an ad
at that time on Craigslist

2748
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,570
that I would walk
people's dogs for free,

2749
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:33,490
and only a few people
took that seriously.

2750
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:36,400
But of the ones that did,
I had a great little cadre

2751
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,920
of dog owners that would allow
me to take their dogs out

2752
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,030
and I was super happy.

2753
01:57:40,030 --> 01:57:41,930
It just made me
very, very happy.

2754
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:44,170
And I really enjoyed it.

2755
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:47,230
And frankly, it was a
great opportunity for me

2756
01:57:47,230 --> 01:57:50,080
to also get to the various dog
breeds and the different dog

2757
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,990
temperaments and to learn a bit
about my ability to interact

2758
01:57:52,990 --> 01:57:54,613
with dogs in a certain way.

2759
01:57:54,613 --> 01:57:56,530
I actually got to be a
pretty good dog walker.

2760
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:57,910
Unfortunately, later
I got a bulldog.

2761
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:58,960
And it turns out
no matter how good

2762
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,940
a dog walker you are, Bulldogs
just simply don't like to walk.

2763
01:58:01,940 --> 01:58:04,000
In fact, if you've ever
walked up to a bulldog

2764
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,550
and you've offered to
scratch or pet that dog,

2765
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:08,600
you'll notice that
Bulldogs love that.

2766
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:11,800
And I would argue, having
been a bulldog owner,

2767
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,410
that they like it because it's
an opportunity for them to stop

2768
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:14,988
moving.

2769
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:16,780
But that's more about
the bulldog than what

2770
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:18,155
I'm about to tell
you next, which

2771
01:58:18,155 --> 01:58:21,190
is this principle of
so-called allogrooming.

2772
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:23,140
Allogrooming is a
pattern of behavior

2773
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:26,980
that's observed in essentially
all mammals but very strongly

2774
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:29,980
in nonhuman primates
and primates,

2775
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:36,260
where individuals within a
species touch one another.

2776
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,930
And this is non-sexual touch.

2777
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:42,250
So this would be someone
brushing somebody else's hair

2778
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,680
or combing their hair or even
using a lint roller on them,

2779
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:46,580
for instance.

2780
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:49,660
Or someone grooming
somebody else.

2781
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:52,330
Now typically, one needs
to have an established

2782
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:53,660
relationship with this person.

2783
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,420
So it could be a professional
type relationship

2784
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:57,128
where this is a barber
cutting somebody's

2785
01:58:57,128 --> 01:59:01,612
hair or a hairdresser cutting
or styling somebody's hair.

2786
01:59:01,612 --> 01:59:03,070
It could be somebody
giving someone

2787
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:04,510
a manicure or a pedicure.

2788
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:06,940
Could be somebody doing skin
care or massage for somebody

2789
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,440
in a professional context.

2790
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,810
Or it could be two
people who have agreed

2791
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:13,205
that it is appropriate
for the context

2792
01:59:13,205 --> 01:59:14,830
and for the relationship
for one person

2793
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:17,110
to be grooming somebody else.

2794
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:19,600
Can even, believe it or not
there's literature on this,

2795
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,930
can even extend into
the realm of people

2796
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:25,210
sort of cleaning and
picking off other people.

2797
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:27,580
Now when we see
this in primates,

2798
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:31,820
it seems like a very cute and
sort of almost understandable

2799
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:32,320
behavior.

2800
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,850
We can see these
pictures online.

2801
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:36,100
If you look them up, you can
just look up allogrooming

2802
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,380
and you'll see vast
number of pictures

2803
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:40,660
of for instance, baboons
picking little things out

2804
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:42,520
of each other's hair.

2805
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:46,610
Or grooming and kind of
perusing one another,

2806
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:49,530
to find things,
presumably parasites

2807
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:51,280
or like little bits
of plants or something

2808
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,947
like that they want
to remove from them.

2809
01:59:52,947 --> 01:59:55,870
Allogrooming is
known to stimulate

2810
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:59,510
a certain category of neurons
called the C tactile fibers.

2811
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:02,620
These are a particular category
of so-called sensory neurons

2812
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:03,890
that innervate our skin.

2813
02:00:03,890 --> 02:00:06,880
So these are literally like
little endings of neurons,

2814
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,010
little wires that
end up in the skin,

2815
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:11,470
that when they are
touched lightly

2816
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:14,302
tend to create a
feeling of well-being

2817
02:00:14,302 --> 02:00:15,760
in the person that's
being touched.

2818
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,710
Again, this is
consensual touch that's

2819
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,300
very context appropriate.

2820
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:22,360
But it's known to
increase levels

2821
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:26,210
of oxytocin, a kind of hormone
slash neurotransmitter.

2822
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:27,460
It's both, really.

2823
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:31,060
That is known to evoke
feelings of bond.

2824
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:34,240
Or of feeling bonded to
somebody or something.

2825
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:36,610
And for many people
we hear about oxytocin

2826
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:40,050
and we think about the bond
between parent and child,

2827
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,800
in particular mother
and infant where it's

2828
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,060
been most extensively studied.

2829
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:45,580
Or between two members
of a romantic couple.

2830
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:47,840
But if you look at the
literature on allogrooming,

2831
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,950
what you find is that when
humans groom one another,

2832
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:54,430
the increases in oxytocin
that are experienced

2833
02:00:54,430 --> 02:01:00,430
are at least on par with and in
fact, more often, more dramatic

2834
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:02,920
in response to allogrooming
than in response

2835
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,700
to other forms of touch.

2836
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:07,690
So the point here
is that allogrooming

2837
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:10,240
is a prosocial
behavior that tends

2838
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:13,300
to associate with
and promote feelings

2839
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:15,280
of well-being and happiness.

2840
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,150
And this is not
a trivial effect.

2841
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:20,170
If you look at the brain imaging
data or other forms of data

2842
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:23,170
on this, allogrooming
is a very powerful form

2843
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:26,590
of bonding between individuals
that's completely nonverbal.

2844
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:28,833
In fact, most often it
doesn't involve eye contact.

2845
02:01:28,833 --> 02:01:31,000
I suppose two people could
be looking at one another

2846
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,800
grooming one another,
but typically, this

2847
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:36,010
is done from the
side or from behind.

2848
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:38,830
Why did I bring up
the paper on pets?

2849
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:43,150
Well it turns out that
when humans stroke dogs,

2850
02:01:43,150 --> 02:01:45,610
or brush their
dogs or stroke cats

2851
02:01:45,610 --> 02:01:48,490
or brush their cats,
et cetera, that

2852
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:50,800
is a form of human to
animal allogrooming.

2853
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:55,670
And it's one in which
both the pet and the human

2854
02:01:55,670 --> 02:01:58,790
receive huge
increases in oxytocin

2855
02:01:58,790 --> 02:02:01,910
and other related neurochemicals
that make us feel bonded.

2856
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:04,490
I bring this up because
the Harvard longitudinal

2857
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:06,920
study on happiness,
and many, many others,

2858
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:09,110
if not hundreds of other
studies on happiness,

2859
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:12,163
point to the importance of
quality social connection.

2860
02:02:12,163 --> 02:02:13,580
You hear this over
and over again.

2861
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:15,110
People on their
deathbeds don't say

2862
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:16,490
they wish they had worked more.

2863
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:19,070
People on their deathbeds
talk about the richness

2864
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:20,750
of social connections
or the wish

2865
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:23,270
that they had invested
more in social connections.

2866
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:25,610
I think a lot of people
think of social connections

2867
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:30,680
only in terms of travel with
or conversation with others.

2868
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:35,090
But much of what we perceive
as deep social connections

2869
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:38,060
also involves physical contact.

2870
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:40,520
And that's something
that's deeply rooted

2871
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,990
in our evolutionary biology.

2872
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:44,690
And it's present both in us
and in non-human primates.

2873
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:48,200
And it's clear
that we can engage

2874
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:52,490
in these kinds of pro-social,
non verbal, non eye contact

2875
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:56,150
type behaviors through things
like non-sexual tactile

2876
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:57,500
touch, a.k.a.

2877
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,220
allogrooming.

2878
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:00,720
So we've been talking about a
number of the different things

2879
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:03,530
that one can do in order to
increase levels of happiness.

2880
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:05,480
And certainly,
before we conclude

2881
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:08,270
today, I'm going to
touch back into not just

2882
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:10,740
synthetic happiness and the
various things we can do,

2883
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:13,640
such as prosocial
spending, allogrooming,

2884
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:16,250
social connection, et cetera.

2885
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:19,040
But also things
related to happiness

2886
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:24,650
that involve focus on vocation
and work and pursuit of goals.

2887
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:26,450
Because as I mentioned
at the beginning,

2888
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:29,348
those are also
critical to increasing

2889
02:03:29,348 --> 02:03:30,890
our state of happiness,
and certainly

2890
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:32,690
our state of security
and the feeling

2891
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:34,790
that we can provide for
ourselves and perhaps

2892
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:35,940
for others, as well.

2893
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:38,010
So we will talk about that.

2894
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:40,370
But I think it's also
important to talk

2895
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:43,460
about this notion of
choice and choices,

2896
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:46,730
and whether or not having
a lot of freedom to choose

2897
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:50,900
or limited freedom in choosing
what we do and what we get,

2898
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:53,160
and what we are able
to pursue in life,

2899
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:56,420
how that relates to
both natural happiness

2900
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,130
and synthetic happiness.

2901
02:03:58,130 --> 02:04:00,710
Dan Gilbert and
others have explored

2902
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:03,140
this issue of freedom
of choice and how

2903
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:04,980
it relates to happiness.

2904
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:07,520
And there I must
say, the findings

2905
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:10,700
are incredibly counterintuitive.

2906
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:15,210
But very, very well supported
by all of their data.

2907
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:18,720
I'm going to summarize a large
amount of those studies at once

2908
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,640
by saying the following.

2909
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:22,557
Dan's laboratory and
other laboratories

2910
02:04:22,557 --> 02:04:24,390
have done experiments
where they give people

2911
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:26,080
a series of options.

2912
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:28,200
And one of the more
classic examples, they

2913
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,540
give people the opportunity
to rate a number

2914
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:32,490
of different
paintings or pictures

2915
02:04:32,490 --> 02:04:36,427
in ascending or descending
order of preference.

2916
02:04:36,427 --> 02:04:38,010
In other words,
they're deciding which

2917
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,680
ones they like most which
ones they like least.

2918
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:43,440
Then what's interesting
is the experimenter

2919
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,360
will vary the
extent to which they

2920
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,080
have to stick to that choice.

2921
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:48,810
So this could be
sticking to the choice

2922
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:51,150
by receiving that
painting to take home.

2923
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:53,790
Or in another
experiment, it was having

2924
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,380
to make a choice
between giving up

2925
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:58,800
one photograph that they,
the research subject took,

2926
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,480
or another photograph
that they took.

2927
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,310
One of the photographs
was going to go off

2928
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:05,250
to a publication, another one
they could keep for themselves.

2929
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:07,590
And the conditions
in that experiment

2930
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:10,930
were either that you
had to make the decision

2931
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:13,980
and it was final, that is,
you could keep one and rate

2932
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:16,470
your decision, or
you could keep one

2933
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:18,870
and then you had the
opportunity to swap out

2934
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:21,340
that picture for the other
one at some later time.

2935
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,460
In other words, these
experiments really

2936
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:25,920
weren't about rating pictures,
they were really about

2937
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,760
whether or not constraining
your choice, meaning

2938
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,500
forcing somebody
to make a choice

2939
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:34,830
and stick to that choice, led
to greater levels or lesser

2940
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:38,040
levels of happiness and
satisfaction with that choice.

2941
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:41,010
And what they find
consistently is

2942
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:45,840
that when people have an
ongoing set of choices

2943
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,418
it leads to reduced
levels of happiness.

2944
02:05:48,418 --> 02:05:50,460
Now that might come as
surprising to many of you,

2945
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,410
but I want to be clear
about what this means.

2946
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:56,460
This is not to say that having a
lot of choices of what you like

2947
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:59,790
most leads to lesser happiness.

2948
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:02,850
And that having fewer
choices about things

2949
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:06,270
you do, or objects you
acquire, et cetera,

2950
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:08,910
leads to greater happiness.

2951
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:11,820
What this set of
experiments really points to

2952
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:15,510
is that when we make a
choice, if we are forced

2953
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:18,060
to stick to that
choice we tend to be

2954
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:21,060
far happier with that
choice than if we maintain

2955
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:23,710
the option to change our mind.

2956
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:26,430
The results of these experiments
are extremely informative,

2957
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:30,130
I believe, in terms of
understanding our real life

2958
02:06:30,130 --> 02:06:30,630
happiness.

2959
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:33,240
That is, happiness
outside the laboratory.

2960
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:35,550
But I think they are
often misunderstood

2961
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:37,590
as meaning that if we
have a lot of choices

2962
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:40,260
we tend to be less happy than
if we have fewer choices.

2963
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:41,340
That is not the case.

2964
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:44,310
Having freedom of
choice is terrific.

2965
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:47,940
And actually, correlates with
elevated levels of happiness.

2966
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:50,910
But once we make
our choice, it's

2967
02:06:50,910 --> 02:06:53,910
clearly the case that
killing all other choices

2968
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,740
or having all other
options killed

2969
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:59,010
for us increases our
satisfaction with the choice

2970
02:06:59,010 --> 02:06:59,970
that we've made.

2971
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:03,960
Whereas, leaving doors open,
leaving options open greatly

2972
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,110
diminishes our sense
of satisfaction.

2973
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:10,570
This has been exported to any
number of different domains.

2974
02:07:10,570 --> 02:07:14,430
So this has been exported to
the domain of making choices

2975
02:07:14,430 --> 02:07:19,800
about what college to go to or
what partner to select in life.

2976
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,990
In every one of
those instances, we

2977
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:23,760
see that our happiness
with our choice

2978
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,680
is very much related
to that choice

2979
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:30,558
being either the only one or
one of very few other options.

2980
02:07:30,558 --> 02:07:32,850
There are a number of different
ways to interpret this.

2981
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:34,920
Through the lens
of neuroscience we

2982
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:38,400
might say that the
prefrontal cortex,

2983
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:41,850
the area of the brain that's
involved in decision making

2984
02:07:41,850 --> 02:07:44,700
and evaluating
different options,

2985
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:48,420
is an area of the brain
that's vital, frankly,

2986
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:51,240
to our evolution as human
beings and to our daily life

2987
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,915
and to our whole life.

2988
02:07:52,915 --> 02:07:54,540
It is, of course,
the thing that allows

2989
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:57,780
us to evaluate different rule
sets, to change rule sets,

2990
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,780
to switch contexts and to
create meaning, et cetera.

2991
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,730
To interpret what's
good what's bad.

2992
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:04,990
But it's also a
fairly costly process,

2993
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:06,900
meaning it's very
metabolically demanding.

2994
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:09,300
And there's an entire
literature related

2995
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:10,830
to what's called ego depletion.

2996
02:08:10,830 --> 02:08:12,990
This is certainly a topic
for a future podcast.

2997
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:15,510
But ego depletion essentially
says that if I have you

2998
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:21,220
attend very intensely to a
given task, for instance,

2999
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:23,580
asking you to count
backwards from 1,000 to 0

3000
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:25,470
in increments of 13.

3001
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:28,230
And then have you
switch about halfway

3002
02:08:28,230 --> 02:08:30,510
through, that's hard
for a lot of people.

3003
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:32,580
If I have you do that,
then your ability

3004
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:37,680
to suppress impulsive behavior
and to do a hard cognitive

3005
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:40,410
or physical task immediately
after that is actually

3006
02:08:40,410 --> 02:08:40,920
suppressed.

3007
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,090
This so-called ego depletion.

3008
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:43,882
It relates to a number
of different things,

3009
02:08:43,882 --> 02:08:46,770
but it certainly
relates to engagement

3010
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:48,240
of the prefrontal
cortex, which is

3011
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:49,830
very metabolically demanding.

3012
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:53,910
So evaluating choices and
doing computation of numbers

3013
02:08:53,910 --> 02:08:56,160
or attending to
things with your mind

3014
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:58,200
and forcing yourself
to focus intensely

3015
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,360
is metabolically demanding.

3016
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,280
And that's a limited
resource that

3017
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:05,010
can be reset by things like
sleep and non sleep deep rest

3018
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:06,900
or idle time or letting
your mind wander.

3019
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:08,730
In that case a
positive mind wandering

3020
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:11,920
to allow your brain to
reset its ability to focus.

3021
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:15,250
But the other thing
that it does is

3022
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:18,520
it impacts the reward
circuitry of the brain,

3023
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,980
the so-called dopamine reward
circuitry and other reward

3024
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:23,262
circuitry of the brain.

3025
02:09:23,262 --> 02:09:24,970
And here I'm painting
with a broad brush.

3026
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:29,060
But it essentially divides
them such that for instance,

3027
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:32,260
if a given choice of
a let's say a partner

3028
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:34,900
or maybe buying ourselves
an article of clothing,

3029
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:37,535
not that I want to compare
selection of a life partner

3030
02:09:37,535 --> 02:09:39,160
to selection of an
article of clothing.

3031
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,810
But just to give
multiple examples.

3032
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:44,980
Might give us, and here
it's arbitrary units, x

3033
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:47,950
units of dopamine increase.

3034
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:50,470
Well, if we buy that
article of clothing or we

3035
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:52,300
select that life
partner, and then

3036
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:55,240
we emerge from the
store or the wedding

3037
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:58,970
and we are focused on what
we purchased for ourselves,

3038
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:03,610
our choice, or our life partner
choice, and only that, well

3039
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:07,370
then there's a certain amount of
neurochemical reward associated

3040
02:10:07,370 --> 02:10:07,870
with that.

3041
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:09,460
And happiness and well-being.

3042
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:13,970
But it's also very
clear that if we

3043
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:18,300
leave those choices, the store
or our wedding for instance,

3044
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:20,960
or a life with somebody for
a moment, even just mentally,

3045
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:23,150
and start thinking
about the other options

3046
02:10:23,150 --> 02:10:25,670
that we might
entertain as possible.

3047
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:28,790
If those are still open to
us in reality or in our mind,

3048
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:32,630
well then our reward circuitry
becomes fractured in a way.

3049
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:35,420
Not physically fractured,
but less attention

3050
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:38,420
is devoted to the reward
circuitry associated

3051
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:40,100
with our choice.

3052
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:43,820
And as a consequence, instead
of it being x units of dopamine,

3053
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:48,320
it's x divided by however
many other choices

3054
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:51,500
we might have available to
us in our mind or in reality.

3055
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,840
So instead of, and again,
these are arbitrary units,

3056
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,905
but instead of a certain
amount of reward,

3057
02:10:55,905 --> 02:10:57,530
it's a certain amount
of reward divided

3058
02:10:57,530 --> 02:10:59,480
by the number of
other options that we

3059
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:03,990
might be considering as
alternatives to what we chose.

3060
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:06,950
And I think this is a
very important aspect

3061
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:11,510
of understanding how limiting
our choices after we've

3062
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:14,690
made them is a
vital part of what

3063
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:16,320
we call synthetic happiness.

3064
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:18,080
In fact, we could
even go so far as

3065
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:20,720
to say that focusing on
the choices we've made

3066
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:24,470
and really investing in
those choices as good ones,

3067
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:26,847
or great ones, and
really trying to limit

3068
02:11:26,847 --> 02:11:28,430
our thinking to the
choices that we've

3069
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:31,490
made once we've
made them is perhaps

3070
02:11:31,490 --> 02:11:34,340
also important to our
natural happiness.

3071
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:38,810
Because it's so inextricably
entwined with what

3072
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:41,070
we think of as a good life.

3073
02:11:41,070 --> 02:11:44,150
And what I mean by that
is if we are constantly

3074
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:46,350
in a mode of evaluative
decision making,

3075
02:11:46,350 --> 02:11:48,080
even after we've
made a decision,

3076
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:52,070
we are not neurochemically
nor psychologically able

3077
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:54,762
to extract the feelings
of happiness associated

3078
02:11:54,762 --> 02:11:55,970
with the choice that we made.

3079
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:57,680
So we've talked about a
number of different dimensions

3080
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:00,230
of happiness, both in synthetic
and natural happiness.

3081
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:02,900
And some of the more
counterintuitive aspects

3082
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:04,490
of happiness.

3083
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:06,470
For instance, that
people tend to adjust

3084
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:11,620
their levels of happiness not
regardless but often in spite

3085
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:13,700
of their life circumstances.

3086
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:17,140
But as we emphasized earlier
in the episode, that is not

3087
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:20,020
to say, at least the
research does not directly

3088
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:23,710
support the idea that
a major trauma or loss

3089
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:25,340
won't impact our happiness.

3090
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,950
In fact, it tends to.

3091
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:29,320
And that's why it's
important that people access

3092
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:31,990
resources and work devoted
to overcoming trauma, which

3093
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:34,430
certainly exists out there.

3094
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:37,540
And of course, there are
the longitudinal studies

3095
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:41,650
in short term studies showing
that income level and material

3096
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:46,030
things don't necessarily scale
with happiness, and vise versa.

3097
02:12:46,030 --> 02:12:49,240
And yet, we also acknowledged
early in the episode

3098
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:51,760
that while indeed money
can't buy happiness,

3099
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,110
it can buffer stress.

3100
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:56,470
And while work doesn't
necessarily bring happiness,

3101
02:12:56,470 --> 02:13:00,190
per se, work can bring
a tremendous feeling

3102
02:13:00,190 --> 02:13:03,400
of meaning and resources
which can then put you

3103
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:07,030
into context in which things
like prosocial contact

3104
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:12,160
and enhanced bonds and
caretaking of others and of you

3105
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:13,210
can be enhanced.

3106
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:16,390
So it would be unfair
and in fact, inaccurate,

3107
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:19,450
to simply view happiness
through the lens of money

3108
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:21,980
doesn't matter, it's all
about social connection.

3109
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,890
And so on and so forth.

3110
02:13:23,890 --> 02:13:26,600
Absolutely, social
connection is important,

3111
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:29,093
which is why we spent some
minutes talking about some

3112
02:13:29,093 --> 02:13:30,760
of the ways to enhance
social connection

3113
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:33,010
both with other human
beings and other animals,

3114
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:35,680
and them with us.

3115
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:39,280
I think there's a opportunity
here to take the research

3116
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:43,150
on happiness, the research
on the neuroscience of what

3117
02:13:43,150 --> 02:13:47,440
happiness and gratitude and
prosocial connection tells us,

3118
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:50,870
and to combine it into a
bit of a model or a toolkit,

3119
02:13:50,870 --> 02:13:51,470
if you will.

3120
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:53,860
And I think indeed, this
will be a toolkit in one

3121
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:56,650
of our future toolkit episodes,
likely merged with the toolkit

3122
02:13:56,650 --> 02:13:59,450
on gratitude, which
we haven't done yet.

3123
02:13:59,450 --> 02:14:04,390
And perhaps even we will do an
entire episode on social bonds

3124
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:06,790
and how to enhance or
build social bonds.

3125
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:10,413
Or at least what the
science tells us about that.

3126
02:14:10,413 --> 02:14:11,830
If we take a step
back and we look

3127
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:15,250
at the concept of happiness,
we can make a couple

3128
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:17,050
of absolute statements.

3129
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:19,490
That is, statements that I
think very few people, if any,

3130
02:14:19,490 --> 02:14:20,110
would contest.

3131
02:14:20,110 --> 02:14:22,690
First of all, there's no
single molecule or chemical

3132
02:14:22,690 --> 02:14:25,330
associated with happiness,
but that the chemical milieu

3133
02:14:25,330 --> 02:14:29,650
of the brain and body
is important for setting

3134
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:33,470
the stage or the
opportunity for happiness.

3135
02:14:33,470 --> 02:14:37,160
Hence, why there are treatments
aimed at alleviating depression

3136
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:40,280
or mania that target certain
neurochemical systems

3137
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:41,990
and hormone systems.

3138
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:45,380
Happiness, at least the
way I'm framing it today,

3139
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:46,830
has essentially two components.

3140
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:49,190
One is meaning.

3141
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:54,470
That is, what sort of meaning
do certain types of interactions

3142
02:14:54,470 --> 02:14:58,310
or behaviors, could be work,
could be social interactions,

3143
02:14:58,310 --> 02:15:01,280
et cetera, carry for us?

3144
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:04,035
And nested in that is this
concept of connection.

3145
02:15:04,035 --> 02:15:06,410
And we talked a bit about
tools for enhancing connection.

3146
02:15:06,410 --> 02:15:08,930
Things like eye contact, but
not constant eye contact.

3147
02:15:08,930 --> 02:15:12,500
Things like being very
present to a conversation

3148
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:15,050
or an activity that
you're engaging in.

3149
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:16,850
Remember, we talked
about the paper,

3150
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:19,218
"A Distracted Mind
is an Unhappy Mind"?

3151
02:15:19,218 --> 02:15:20,510
The paper published in Science.

3152
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:22,843
And we talked about the study,
also published in Science

3153
02:15:22,843 --> 02:15:28,380
in which giving money, but
also knowing how that money has

3154
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:30,570
positively impacted
others, leads

3155
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:33,090
to this feeling of pro-social
connection and happiness

3156
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:35,430
in the giver and
in the receiver.

3157
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,680
And I should mention
again that it's not

3158
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:40,560
just the giving of money but
also the giving of effort

3159
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:44,170
and time and attention that
can have similar effects.

3160
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:45,840
So we have meaning
and connection,

3161
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:48,310
and a number of different
ways to access those.

3162
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:50,640
And then we have
this access that I'm

3163
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,990
referring to as
performance and resources.

3164
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:56,130
And I'm talking about
performance and resources

3165
02:15:56,130 --> 02:15:59,708
as it relates to
natural happiness, not

3166
02:15:59,708 --> 02:16:01,500
synthetic happiness,
but natural happiness.

3167
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:05,340
Because we would be
wrong, I believe,

3168
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:08,250
if we were to say that
income doesn't matter.

3169
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:11,190
I think it's fair to say,
based on the research,

3170
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:13,290
that income matters.

3171
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:16,620
And income that can cover
costs of living plus that

3172
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:18,702
includes some buffer.

3173
02:16:18,702 --> 02:16:19,910
And what do I mean by buffer?

3174
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:23,870
I mean buffer to the anxiety
that circumstances might change

3175
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:24,950
is important.

3176
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:28,520
Now that's going to vary
from person to person.

3177
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:31,190
Meaning some people
will be perfectly happy

3178
02:16:31,190 --> 02:16:37,610
making $1 more than their
absolute cost of living

3179
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:38,900
every month.

3180
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:41,808
Other people will require
a more substantial buffer

3181
02:16:41,808 --> 02:16:45,888
in order to protect them against
the negative psychological

3182
02:16:45,888 --> 02:16:48,447
effects of worrying about
for instance, inflation.

3183
02:16:48,448 --> 02:16:50,240
Or worrying that they
might lose their job.

3184
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:52,459
And this is why I think
most people recommend

3185
02:16:52,459 --> 02:16:56,209
having, if possible, some
buffer in their bank account

3186
02:16:56,209 --> 02:16:59,920
that could cover two or
three or maybe even six

3187
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:02,650
or maybe even 12 months
of living expenses

3188
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:04,388
were they to lose
their job or something

3189
02:17:04,388 --> 02:17:06,319
catastrophic happened to them.

3190
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:08,950
So if we're going to
talk about happiness,

3191
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:12,308
I think it's only fair, only
accurate, and frankly, only

3192
02:17:12,308 --> 02:17:17,439
respectful to talk about
living requirements and cost

3193
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:18,459
of living requirements.

3194
02:17:18,459 --> 02:17:20,350
That includes this
sort of buffer.

3195
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:22,180
And that buffer to
anxiety is going

3196
02:17:22,180 --> 02:17:25,030
to vary depending on how
anxious somebody gets

3197
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:27,308
about the possibility
of catastrophic things

3198
02:17:27,308 --> 02:17:29,558
happening to them, like
losing their job or their rent

3199
02:17:29,558 --> 02:17:30,569
going up or doubling.

3200
02:17:30,570 --> 02:17:32,320
And here, I'm talking
about hypotheticals.

3201
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:34,900
But I think we all know
people and perhaps ourselves

3202
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:37,459
have experienced those
kinds of circumstances.

3203
02:17:37,459 --> 02:17:39,760
So when we talk about
happiness we absolutely

3204
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:41,230
need to think about resources.

3205
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:43,209
And we also need to
think about performance.

3206
02:17:43,209 --> 02:17:46,780
I think we would be completely
inaccurate if we simply

3207
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:51,218
said, oh, any work
leading to any outcomes.

3208
02:17:51,218 --> 02:17:53,378
Any effort, regardless
of whether or not

3209
02:17:53,379 --> 02:17:56,020
it gets you an A in
school or an F in school

3210
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:58,420
isn't going to impact
your happiness.

3211
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:00,709
I don't think anyone
would agree with that.

3212
02:18:00,709 --> 02:18:02,950
And yet if you look at
the major takeaways,

3213
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:06,459
at least as they are
communicated typically

3214
02:18:06,459 --> 02:18:10,808
in the public sphere around
the longitudinal and short term

3215
02:18:10,808 --> 02:18:14,019
studies of happiness,
the takeaway generally

3216
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:17,530
is more focused on
social connection

3217
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:19,299
and how money is not important.

3218
02:18:19,299 --> 02:18:22,420
I don't think anyone that's
saying that actually means

3219
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:26,860
that income that can cover
your expenses plus some buffer

3220
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:27,580
isn't important.

3221
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:29,270
But it's often not stated.

3222
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:32,020
So if we were to come up with a
general model of happiness that

3223
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:34,570
includes various tools
for how to increase

3224
02:18:34,570 --> 02:18:36,790
our levels of happiness,
I think it's only

3225
02:18:36,790 --> 02:18:40,388
fair to include both natural
and synthetic forms of happiness

3226
02:18:40,388 --> 02:18:43,899
and to pursue both natural
and synthetic happiness.

3227
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,058
Just to remind you,
natural happiness

3228
02:18:46,058 --> 02:18:48,369
is the kind of happiness
that we associate

3229
02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:50,980
with obtaining something,
either by effort

3230
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:52,330
or because it was given to us.

3231
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:54,850
Although, I definitely want
to highlight the fact that

3232
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:59,888
receiving things that don't
require much reward in order

3233
02:18:59,888 --> 02:19:02,439
to receive them over
time can be detrimental

3234
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:03,638
to our dopamine system.

3235
02:19:03,638 --> 02:19:04,958
That's an important aside.

3236
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:08,290
The other form of happiness
is the form of happiness

3237
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:10,030
that we call
synthetic happiness.

3238
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:13,570
Which is, for instance,
focusing on social connection.

3239
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:16,270
And we talked about ways
to do that as a means

3240
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:17,770
to enhance your happiness.

3241
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:20,998
Again, the language, the
name synthetic happiness

3242
02:19:20,998 --> 02:19:22,540
implies something
kind of artificial.

3243
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:25,941
But frankly, genuine social
connection is genuine.

3244
02:19:25,941 --> 02:19:27,399
There's nothing
artificial about it

3245
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:29,740
or synthetic about it, is
that you can synthesize it

3246
02:19:29,740 --> 02:19:31,990
through action, through
deliberate action.

3247
02:19:31,990 --> 02:19:36,400
Likewise, being focused
or encouraging yourself.

3248
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:39,129
Working on being focused on
whatever activities you happen

3249
02:19:39,129 --> 02:19:41,260
to be engaged in,
positive or negative,

3250
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:43,629
is known to increase
your levels of happiness.

3251
02:19:43,629 --> 02:19:46,240
Again, this is a form
of synthetic happiness.

3252
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:49,480
You're not obtaining
anything new or additional

3253
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:50,710
as a consequence of this.

3254
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:52,930
It's entirely internal.

3255
02:19:52,930 --> 02:19:54,400
There's no external reward.

3256
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,260
There isn't more
money that arrives

3257
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,820
with this or a better grade.

3258
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,410
Although, I would
make the argument

3259
02:19:59,410 --> 02:20:01,360
that if you are
present to the work

3260
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:05,140
you're doing in any context,
physical or mental work,

3261
02:20:05,140 --> 02:20:06,970
it's very likely
that you are going

3262
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:08,710
to perform better at that work.

3263
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:11,620
So we have natural happiness
and synthetic happiness.

3264
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:15,100
And both of them require
our attention and effort.

3265
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:18,490
And in fact, if we
were to draw a link

3266
02:20:18,490 --> 02:20:20,740
between natural and
synthetic happiness,

3267
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:22,810
it really is this
concept of presence,

3268
02:20:22,810 --> 02:20:24,910
of really being focused
on what we're doing,

3269
02:20:24,910 --> 02:20:28,600
that's most likely to lead
to the outcomes that we want.

3270
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:31,840
Both externally, in terms of
receiving monetary rewards

3271
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:33,662
or grades, or
praise, or whatever

3272
02:20:33,662 --> 02:20:35,620
it is that you happen to
be pursuing out there,

3273
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:37,180
resources of some kind.

3274
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:41,020
And presence, and
striving to be present

3275
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:44,680
when in the pursuit of so-called
synthetic happiness in the form

3276
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:48,492
of social connection or in
the form of really focusing

3277
02:20:48,492 --> 02:20:50,200
on the choice that
you've made and making

3278
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:52,300
the best of that choice,
especially since you

3279
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:56,530
made that choice in a way that
you deemed best at the time.

3280
02:20:56,530 --> 02:21:00,400
Well, that also is known to
increase your overall levels

3281
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:01,280
of happiness.

3282
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,300
So if an ability to focus
and attend to things deeply

3283
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:08,290
is really what's most important,
and really acts as the greatest

3284
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:10,750
lever for both natural
and synthetic happiness,

3285
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:14,860
well then, tools like a 5 minute
daily meditation or a 13 minute

3286
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:18,070
day meditation, as
well as tools that

3287
02:21:18,070 --> 02:21:20,980
allow us to get excellent
sleep every night.

3288
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:24,247
Which, of course, sets the basis
for attention during the day.

3289
02:21:24,247 --> 02:21:26,080
If you've ever had a
poor night's sleep then

3290
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:28,480
you are very familiar
with how hard it

3291
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:31,090
is to focus the following day.

3292
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:33,110
At least for long
periods of time.

3293
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:35,500
But building our
capacity to focus

3294
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:38,140
through a focusing exercise,
which again, is often

3295
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:40,390
called meditation, but
is really simply just

3296
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:43,150
a focusing and
perceptual exercise.

3297
02:21:43,150 --> 02:21:45,370
That's going to create
an outsized effect

3298
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:47,920
on all the aspects,
all the behaviors

3299
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:50,590
that we know feed into
creating natural and synthetic

3300
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:51,430
happiness.

3301
02:21:51,430 --> 02:21:53,800
And so it's really fair
to say that our ability

3302
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:57,780
to attend and focus really
equates to happiness.

3303
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:59,810
So as is often typical
of this podcast,

3304
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:02,403
today we've talked a lot
about the various aspects

3305
02:22:02,403 --> 02:22:04,820
of the science of happiness,
including the different forms

3306
02:22:04,820 --> 02:22:07,790
of happiness and tools to
access those different forms

3307
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:08,720
of happiness.

and performance.

3342
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:20,510
Some of which overlap
with information

3343
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:22,190
covered on the
Huberman Lab podcast.

3344
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:24,950
But often, which is distinct
from information covered

3345
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:26,150
on the Huberman Lab podcast.

3346
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:28,500
So again, that's Huberman
Lab on Instagram, Twitter,

3347
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:29,330
