00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,070
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,920
where we discuss science
and science based tools

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,973
for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,290
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,120
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,220
Today we are discussing nicotine.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,890
Nicotine is one of the most
commonly consumed substances

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,660
on the entire planet.

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,760
There are literally billions of people

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,670
that ingest nicotine on a daily basis.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,700
Most of those people consume
nicotine via smoking,

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,890
and in particular smoking tobacco.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,660
Tobacco contains nicotine and it

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,940
contains a bunch of other things as well,

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,230
which we will talk about.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,960
And the burning of tobacco
liberates nicotine and makes it

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,200
accessible to the various
cells and tissues of the body.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,720
But of course, there are other
sources of nicotine as well.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,270
Some people consume nicotine through dip,

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,340
that is placing tobacco on the inside

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,860
of the lip or in the cheek.

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,470
Some people consume nicotine via snuff,

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,750
which is literally the
shoving of tobacco leaves

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,510
up the nostrils and allowing the tobacco

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,240
to access the nervous
system and other areas

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,400
of the body by permeating into the

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,740
mucosal membranes, that is the lining,

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,900
the soft lining of the nasal passages.

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,720
And of course there are
nicotine patches, nicotine gum,

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,370
there's nicotine in pill form,

32
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,190
there are toothpicks dipped
in nicotine, et cetera.

33
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,890
Today we are going to separate
our discussion of nicotine

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,260
from a discussion of smoking and vaping

35
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,570
and the other forms of
delivery for nicotine.

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,120
We will be talking
about smoking and vaping

37
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,520
and other routes of
nicotine administration,

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,840
both for sake of highlighting
their detriments to health

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,560
and, believe it or not, in certain cases,

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,080
keep in mind very specific certain cases,

41
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,080
the possible health benefits
of delivering nicotine

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,600
through specific modalities.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,550
Turns out those modalities do not

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,820
include smoking cigarettes or vaping.

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,730
And we are going to pay particular
attention to vaping today

46
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,340
because vaping use is on the rise,

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,390
in particular in young
people, and vaping use,

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,660
and the fact that most
tobacco that's consumed

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,810
through vaping includes
quite amount of nicotine

50
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,090
has created a scenario where nicotine

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,590
because of its ability to change

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,770
certain chemicals in the
brain can actually lead to

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,785
addiction for a number of other
substances related to vaping

54
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,560
and vaping associated behaviors.

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,900
If all of that seems like
a lot to get your arms

56
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,660
and your mind around right here
at the outset, don't worry,

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,430
I'll walk you through this,

58
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,870
regardless of whether or
not you have a background

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,980
in biology or not.

60
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,990
I promise that you'll come
through at the end of this

61
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,320
episode with a deep understanding
of how nicotine works

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,690
in the brain and body,
some of its benefits,

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,340
some of its potential drawbacks,

64
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,450
and you'll have clear optics
as to why smoking and vaping

65
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,970
and other forms of nicotine
delivery have the effects

66
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,880
that they do on your
biology and psychology.

67
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,770
I'm pleased to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast

68
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,080
is now partnered with
Momentous supplements.

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,330
We partnered with Momentous
for several important reasons.

70
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,586
First of all,

71
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,360
they ship internationally
because we know that many of you

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,430
are located outside of the United States.

73
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,440
Second of all, and perhaps most important,

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,990
the quality of their
supplements is second to none,

75
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,640
both in terms of purity and precision

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,590
of the amounts of the ingredients.

77
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,230
Third, we've really emphasized supplements

78
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,450
that are single ingredient supplements,

79
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,210
and that are supplied in
dosages that allow you

80
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,460
to build a supplementation protocol

81
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,290
that's optimized for cost,

82
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,210
that's optimized for effectiveness,

83
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,580
and that you can add things
and remove things from your

84
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,430
protocol in a way that's really
systematic and scientific.

85
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,600
If you'd like to see the supplements

86
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,950
that we've partnered with Momentous on,

87
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,040
you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.

88
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,180
There you'll see those supplements.

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,640
And just keep in mind that
we are constantly expanding

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,340
the library of supplements
available through Momentous

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,270
on a regular basis.

92
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,880
Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.

93
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,930
Before we go any further,

94
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,180
I just want to highlight a key takeaway

95
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,960
from a previous episode,
which is our episode on focus.

96
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,840
And in fact was a toolkit for focus.

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,580
So during the toolkit for focus episode,

98
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,920
we talked about a large number
of behavioral, pharmacologic,

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,770
and another interventions
that you can use to increase

100
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,560
your level of concentration
and focus for whatever purpose,

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,200
cognitive endeavors, learning languages,

102
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,630
focusing in school, on work, et cetera,

103
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,220
or physical pursuits.

104
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,500
Now one of the key takeaways is that

105
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,540
there are really two key

106
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,000
protocols that I believe
everyone should understand

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,130
and know about and why they work

108
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,540
because they are so effective,

109
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,269
and also because they dovetail
nicely with some of the

110
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,400
information that we're
going to talk about today,

111
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,110
which will explain why nicotine

112
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,170
is so effective in increasing focus.

113
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,660
And these two protocols are as follows.

114
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,810
Data based on studies
done in Wendy Suzuki's lab

115
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,430
at New York University.

116
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,980
And of course, Wendy was
a guest on this podcast.

117
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,780
So you can check out
that episode if you like,

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,030
but studies done in her laboratory point

119
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,760
to the fact that a daily,
very brief, in fact,

120
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,780
only 13 minute meditation
can vastly increase

121
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,460
focus and focus ability,

122
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,610
not just immediately after
the meditation practice,

123
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,680
but at all other times as well.

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,513
So again,

125
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,620
this is a meditation practice done daily

126
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,700
for just 13 minutes.

127
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,230
It's a very simple meditation practice

128
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,700
where one sits or lies down,

129
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,450
closes your eyes and
directs your attention

130
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,780
to a place just between your
two eyes and right above it.

131
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,613
So on your forehead.

132
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:11,820
But just inside of that,

133
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,590
and please understand that your brain

134
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,850
does not have sensory receptors.

135
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,740
So unlike focusing on your fingertips

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,590
and the sensations there,
if you focus on your brain,

137
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,970
you can't actually sense anything

138
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,230
in your brain except your thoughts.

139
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,410
So the idea then is that you
continually bring your focus

140
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,110
back to that location just about an inch

141
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,180
behind your forehead over and over again.

142
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,610
And it's the refocusing of your attention

143
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,290
to that location after it drifts

144
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,320
that succeeds in increasing
your focus ability, again,

145
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,300
not just during the
meditation and afterward,

146
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,920
but at other times as well.

147
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,680
So this 13 minute a day
meditation is exceedingly simple

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,510
and exceedingly effective.

149
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,950
It should be performed every day,

150
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,050
but if you miss a day,
just go back to doing it.

151
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,430
Don't despair too much.

152
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,800
And you will see these
positive effects, say the data.

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,110
Also increase effects on mood and other

154
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,390
positive aspects of mental
health and performance.

155
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,160
So that's the first tool in protocol.

156
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,860
The second tool in protocol
relates to the general

157
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,710
what I called arrow model of focus.

158
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,470
This was a model that I created
in order to simplify the

159
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,020
vast amounts of data on
focus and concentration

160
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,100
and how they are created

161
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,070
by the various chemical
systems within your brain.

162
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,110
We're going to hear a lot about
these chemical systems again

163
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,440
today in the context of nicotine
and they are as follows.

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,970
You can think about focus

165
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,000
on any goal or any endeavor as an arrow.

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,130
So just imagine an arrow
which has an arrow head

167
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,810
and a shaft, and we'll
add a third component

168
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,713
to it in a moment.

169
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,170
The head of the arrow,

170
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,700
meaning the direction of your focus,

171
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,190
is largely set by acetylcholine,

172
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,690
which is a chemical in the brain.

173
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,780
The shaft of the arrow
is set by a chemical

174
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,600
called adrenaline, also
called epinephrine.

175
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,470
Those are the same thing.

176
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,260
In the brain typically it's
referred to as epinephrine,

177
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,280
and in the body,

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,140
it's more commonly
referred to as adrenaline,

179
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,060
but those are the same neurochemical.

180
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,300
Epinephrine slash adrenaline
represents the shaft

181
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,510
of the arrow and it's providing the energy

182
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,220
for which to focus.

183
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,600
And then we can put behind that arrow

184
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,150
a little propeller or
a motor, if you like,

185
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,950
and the propeller or motor in the context

186
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,470
of this neurochemistry model is dopamine,

187
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,180
which provides ongoing motivation.

188
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,670
It pushes that arrow forward continually

189
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,180
as you strive to focus
on a particular thing.

190
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,740
This particular arrow model,

191
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,680
that is your ability
to increase your focus,

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,070
can be enhanced therefore
by increasing acetylcholine,

193
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,700
epinephrine, and dopamine simultaneously.

194
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,410
And there are a lot of
different ways to do that.

195
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,910
But one of the more effective ways to do

196
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,200
that via supplement protocols
is so-called Alpha GPC.

197
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,820
Alpha GPC taken in 300
milligram form 10 to 30 minutes

198
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,850
before a about of cognitive
work or a about of physical work

199
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,760
will increase your focus by way
of increasing acetylcholine,

200
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,033
and to some extent, increasing
epinephrine as well.

201
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,210
The dopamine increase will
have to be achieved either

202
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,190
through cognitive processing,

203
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,870
that is telling yourself
you're doing a good job

204
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,520
and moving forward because thoughts really

205
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,590
do impact your levels of dopamine,

206
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,680
or some other sort of
pro dopamine or dopamine

207
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,160
increasing protocol also
discussed in the toolkit for focus

208
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,070
and our episode on dopamine
for motivation and drive.

209
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,410
So the key thing here to
understand is that the 13 minute

210
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,480
a day meditation is a very effective way

211
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,220
to increase focus capacity.

212
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,480
And then in the short term,

213
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,630
if you want to provide a
boost now and again to focus,

214
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,390
300 milligrams of Alpha
GPC can be very effective.

215
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,413
There are various sources for that

216
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:26,070
that we'll link to one of them
in the show note captions.

217
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,770
By no means am I saying that
you need to take alpha GPC.

218
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,780
A number of people will
certainly opt not to.

219
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,210
And a number of people
might be saying, well,

220
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,820
I've heard that Alpha GPC
can increase focus by way of

221
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,090
increasing acetylcholine and
norepinephrine or epinephrine,

222
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,100
but it can also increase TMAO,

223
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,190
which is a kind of a negative
marker of cardiac health

224
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,690
and cardiovascular health.

225
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,020
For that reason, I and many
others will take 600 milligrams

226
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,370
of a garlic capsule, which
can offset that TMAO increase.

227
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,140
It remains uncertain as to how much

228
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,620
Alpha GPC one needs to
take before increasing TMAO

229
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,690
levels to a point where it's of concern

230
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,790
that you would even need
to take the garlic capsule.

231
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,560
But I just mention it in any case,

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,330
because it's a pretty simple fix.

233
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,760
Garlic has other health
benefits too, of course,

234
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200
and for most people,

235
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,260
300 milligrams of Alpha GPC
taken every once in a while.

236
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,660
I certainly don't encourage people

237
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,349
to take Alpha GPC every
time they want to focus.

238
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,610
I always emphasize behavioral tools first,

239
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,300
then focusing on nutritional
tools and on occasion using

240
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,910
supplement based tools to encourage

241
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,040
increased levels of focus.

242
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,260
And then of course there are a various

243
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,930
number of different prescription compounds

244
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,150
that if you're working with
a board certified physician,

245
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,983
they could prescribe you

246
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:40,080
if you need additional tools
for focus, things like Ritalin,

247
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,170
Adderall, Modafinil,
Armodafinil, Vyvanse, et cetera,

248
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,510
for many people are going to
be important and maybe even

249
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,120
necessary for people with ADHD, et cetera,

250
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,467
but that's a category into itself.

251
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:50,460
And as I always say,

252
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,740
I'm not a physician, so I
don't prescribe anything.

253
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,503
I'm a professor, so I profess many things.

254
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,470
And today I just wanted to
pass along or redirect your

255
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,530
attention to that episode on focus

256
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,850
and highlight those two tools,

257
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,770
the 13 minute a day meditation,

258
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,760
and 300 milligram Alpha GPC
for increasing focus capacity

259
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,320
and for acutely,

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,900
that is temporarily
giving an additional boost

261
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,490
for a about of focus.

262
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,100
And of course, if you choose
not to use those protocols,

263
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
that's perfectly fine too,
there's certainly no obligation.

264
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,790
They are simply available to you

265
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,950
should you choose to try them.

266
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,860
And if nothing else you now have in mind

267
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,110
the neurochemistry of acetylcholine,

268
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,480
epinephrine slash
adrenaline, and dopamine,

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,390
and that will really set the
stage for understanding just

270
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,170
how effective and why nicotine

271
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,060
is so effective at
increasing focus, motivation,

272
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,740
and even as you'll soon hear,

273
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,840
working memory and cognitive capacity.

274
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,800
Before we begin,

275
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,990
I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate

276
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,270
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

277
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,580
It is however part of my desire and effort

278
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,500
to bring zero cost to consumer information

279
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,660
about science and science related tools

280
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,970
to the general public, and
keeping with that theme,

281
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,610
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

282
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,620
Our first sponsor is Thesis.

283
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,040
Thesis makes custom nootropics,
and to be quite direct,

284
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,100
I do not like the word
nootropics because it translates

285
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,850
to smart drugs, and to be direct again,

286
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,890
there is no such thing as a smart drug.

287
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,990
That is there's no such thing as a drug

288
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,720
that can make you smarter
because there is no circuit

289
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,980
in the brain for being smart.

290
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,360
There are circuits in the brain for focus.

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,730
There are circuits in the
brain for task switching.

292
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,070
There are circuits in the
brain related to creativity

293
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,330
and so on and so forth.

294
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,640
So the idea that there
would be a single smart drug

295
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
or nootropic is simply foolish.

296
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,240
And fortunately Thesis
understands this and therefore has

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,540
created custom notropics that
are designed to get you into

298
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,720
the states of mind and body
that are optimal for your goals.

299
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,120
I've been taking Thesis
nootropics for quite a while now,

300
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,820
and I've been extremely
pleased with the results.

301
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,400
I take a clarity formula
that's specifically designed

302
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
for me prior to long
bouts of cognitive work.

303
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,950
And I take an energy formula
prior to particularly

304
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,690
challenging physical workouts.

305
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,910
To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,

306
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,420
you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.

307
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,090
Take a three minute quiz and
Thesis will send you four

308
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,190
different formulas to
try in your first month.

309
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,950
Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

310
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,810
and use the code Huberman at checkout

311
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,760
to get 10% off your first box.

312
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,359
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

313
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:20,070
InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition platform that

314
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,040
analyzes data from your blood
and DNA to help you better

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,630
reach your health goals.

316
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,970
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

317
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,160
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

318
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,080
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

319
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,690
can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.

320
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,560
One of the major issues

321
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,476
with blood tests or DNA tests, however,

322
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,610
is that typically you'll
get your data back

323
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,710
and you won't know what
to do with those data.

324
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,140
InsideTracker has solved
this problem by creating a

325
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,840
personalized platform where
when you get numbers back

326
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,480
about your hormones,
metabolic factors, et cetera,

327
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,520
it will direct you to specific protocols

328
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,580
in the realms of nutrition,
exercise, supplementation.

329
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,580
And that includes things
to do, things to consider,

330
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,070
and things not to do in
order to bring those numbers

331
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,620
into the ranges that are
optimal for your immediate

332
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,700
and long-term goals.

333
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,080
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

334
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,810
you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

337
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,200
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

338
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,030
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

339
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,010
that are the absolute highest quality.

340
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,020
The company was founded by
two all American swimmers

341
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,030
from Stanford, and everything about ROKA

342
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,950
eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed

343
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,330
with performance in mind.

344
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,790
I've spent a lifetime
working on the biology

345
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,730
of the visual system.

346
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,040
And I can tell you that your
visual system has to contend

347
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,050
with a number of important
challenges in order for you

348
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,310
to be able to see clearly.

349
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,930
Now ROKA understands this and everything

350
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,390
about their eyeglasses were
designed in order for you

351
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,180
to see with optimal clarity
regardless of activities.

352
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,760
ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses are superb

353
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,860
for wearing while you run or cycle.

354
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,900
In fact, they were originally
designed for that purpose.

355
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,100
They're extremely lightweight.

356
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,933
In fact, most of the time,

357
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:53,370
I can't even remember
that they're on my face,

358
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,250
and they won't fall off if you get sweaty.

359
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,980
In addition, ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses

360
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,360
have a terrific aesthetic.

361
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,820
So while a lot of so-called
performance eyeglasses out there

362
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,650
will make you look like
a cyborg if you want to,

363
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,030
and they do have those varieties,

364
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,510
they also have varieties of
aesthetic choices that you would

365
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,940
be very comfortable wearing
to work or to school

366
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,674
or just out and about.

367
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:14,507
And that's one of the reasons I like them.

368
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:15,390
I don't really have to think about having

369
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,550
too many pairs of
sunglasses or eyeglasses.

370
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,340
I can just have one or two of
each pair and I'm good to go

371
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,600
no matter where I go.

372
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,210
If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses,

373
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,700

Again, that's roka.com and
enter the code Huberman

377
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,860
at checkout.

378
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,440
Let's talk about nicotine
and how nicotine impacts

379
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
our brains, our bodies,
our mental performance,

380
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,470
our mental health, our
physical performance,

381
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,937
and our physical health.

382
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:45,770
Now once again,

383
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,630
I want to remind everybody that
we really need to separate out

384
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,300
a discussion about nicotine
from the discussion

385
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,790
about the delivery device for nicotine.

386
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,130
In other words, when we're
talking about nicotine,

387
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,680
we are not necessarily
talking about smoking.

388
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,030
Although we might be.

389
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,720
There are things associated
with smoking and with vaping and

390
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,840
other means of getting
nicotine into our system

391
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,390
that have their own
effects, both negative,

392
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,030
and in some cases positive.

393
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,863
Indeed later,

394
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:15,630
we will talk about how you
can actually use nicotine

395
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,160
to get over smoking addiction.

396
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,200
This won't come as a
surprise to many people,

397
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,990
but what perhaps will come as
a surprise is the fact that

398
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,810
many people actually use
nicotine-like substances or

399
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,560
nicotine itself in order to
relieve nicotine addiction.

400
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
So we'll talk about that
and what that looks like

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,260
and offer various protocols
for you later in the episode.

402
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,030
I also want to mention here
at the outset that I have

403
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,319
a long standing interest in nicotine.

404
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,710
In fact, early in my scientific career,

405
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,210
I did research on nicotine

406
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,520
and its role in brain development.

407
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,940
And I've had a long standing
interest in neuroplasticity,

408
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,520
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

409
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,680
And so experiments that have
been done by close colleagues

410
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,450
and friends of mine have really emphasized

411
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,450
the fact that acetylcholine,
and in particular,

412
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,640
when acetylcholine activates so-called

413
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,380
nicotinic receptors,

414
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,690
something you'll learn
more about in a little bit,

415
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,930
that can actually serve
as a gateway or a trigger

416
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,240
for directed rewiring of the brain.

417
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,140
So this is fascinating.

418
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,420
We think of nicotine as
something that we take,

419
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,870
but actually we have
receptors that is locations

420
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,690
in the brain to which nicotine binds

421
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,700
and can exert its effects.

422
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,100
And those receptors did not
come about because of the

423
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,980
existence of tobacco or the
existence of vaping pens,

424
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,840
or because of the existence of anything

425
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,010
in the outside world.

426
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,360
The fact that there are
nicotinic receptors in our brain

427
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,570
and body tells you that acetylcholine

428
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,030
and nicotine themselves
have very important roles

429
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,700
in normal brain and body function,

430
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,580
so much so that I often
like to point to an anecdote

431
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,330
of a very well known Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist.

432
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,500
I won't reveal who they are.

433
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
They're not a faculty member at Stanford,

434
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,330
but many neuroscientists
know of this person

435
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,520
and many people in the outside
world know of this person.

436
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,990
And they are also well known
for their love of nicotine.

437
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,450
I once sat in this
person's office, and he,

438
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,743
I will reveal it as a he,

439
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,349
consumed no fewer than
three pieces of nicotine gum

440
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,389
during that relatively short conversation

441
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,920
of about 45 minutes.

442
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,540
And that was surprising to me.

443
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,319
And I asked him why he was
taking so much nicotine

444
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,729
through nicotine gum.

445
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,780
And he replied that for years,

446
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,371
he had been a chronic smoker,

447
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:26,190
which on the one hand had greatly impaired

448
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,079
his cardiovascular health and his fitness,

449
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,913
no surprise there.

450
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,030
And we'll talk a little bit more about

451
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,000
what the underlying reasons
are, but most everyone,

452
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,640
if not everyone knows
that smoking cigarettes

453
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,910
or smoking in general
really impairs lung health.

454
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,710
There's just simply no question about it.

455
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,910
There are some more or less
unhealthy ways to smoke,

456
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,910
but the quite honest
message is that smoking

457
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,270
of any kind is going to disrupt
lung endothelial function,

458
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,670
lung function, blood
vessels, and so forth.

459
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,560
It's going to make it harder
to breathe with vigor,

460
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,890
take deep breaths, deliver
oxygen to tissues, et cetera.

461
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,000
That said,

462
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,300
he also pointed out that
the data on nicotine

463
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,140
specifically are pointing
to the fact that nicotine

464
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,040
can be, can be protective
against certain forms

465
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,660
of cognitive impairment.

466
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,010
And that is why he continued

467
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,350
to chew nicotine containing gum.

468
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,710
And he swore by the focus
enhancing and motivation enhancing

469
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,290
effects of nicotine containing gum.

470
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,750
Now that is not a call to
arms for you to run out

471
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,560
and start chewing or consuming
nicotine containing products.

472
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,780
We will talk about those
products later in the episode,

473
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,250
some of their potential advantages,

474
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,170
some of their potential disadvantages.

475
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,440
Now I share this anecdote
because it nicely separates

476
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,270
nicotine from the delivery device

477
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,370
through which nicotine arrives.

478
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,140
Now I haven't talked to this individual

479
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,770
in a few years to see whether
not the nicotine is working

480
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,650
to stave off any kind of
Alzheimer's or neurodegenerative

481
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,230
or cognitive impairment
that would come with age.

482
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,110
This gentleman is getting up in the years

483
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,240
and seems quite sharp nonetheless,

484
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,180
but then again was
always exceedingly sharp.

485
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,180
The point is nicotine is a
substance that can both promote

486
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,820
cognitive function, and
under some conditions,

487
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,860
if taken to inappropriate,

488
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,720
or I should say to extreme dosages,

489
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,790
can also impair cognitive function.

490
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,280
So today we really need to
have a nuanced conversation

491
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,100
about nicotine, one that
includes some of the benefits,

492
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,400
some of the drawbacks, in
particular for children,

493
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,710
certainly for people that are pregnant,

494
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,900
for people that have addictive tendencies,

495
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,820
and for people that have depression

496
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,370
and any other kind of mood disorders.

497
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,420
What I will tell you soon
is that nicotine can be very

498
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,260
powerful as a mood modulator
and many people who have tried

499
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,470
to quit nicotine mainly
through the form of smoking

500
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,410
will find that their mood
can drop substantially.

501
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,050
So nicotine does a lot of
things in the brain and body.

502
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,960
And so I'd like to begin by
talking about what exactly

503
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,380
nicotine is and how it
impacts your brain and body.

504
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,570
So what is nicotine and where is it found?

505
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,450
Now obviously nicotine is
found in the tobacco plant,

506
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,720
but nicotine is also found in nightshades.

507
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,230
That is tomatoes, eggplant,
and sweet peppers.

508
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,990
Although the concentrations
of nicotine in tomatoes,

509
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,870
eggplants, and sweet
peppers is vastly lower

510
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,090
than it is in the tobacco plant.

511
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,180
You actually can also
find nicotine in potatoes.

512
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,840
Now why is nicotine present
in potatoes and tomatoes

513
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,150
and in the tobacco plant at all?

514
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,490
Well, nicotine is a plant alkaloid.

515
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,380
We'll get into alkaloids
a little bit later,

516
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,950
but it is thought that these
alkaloids evolved in plants

517
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,970
as a way to prevent
insects from eating them.

518
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,250
And without going into
a lot of insect biology,

519
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,490
the reason or the rationale
behind this explanation is that

520
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,240
nicotine is not only a substance
in tobacco that people use

521
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,130
or in the various
medications that people use,

522
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,370
but it's also used as a
pesticide because it can

523
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,030
dramatically disrupt the
nervous system of insects.

524
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,770
It can render them infertile,

525
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,410
which is not to say that it
renders humans infertile.

526
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,243
We want to say, again,

527
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:02,340
it is not the case that nicotine
renders humans infertile,

528
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,680
but it can make certain insects infertile.

529
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,567
It can actually disrupt
their motor function

530
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,980
and their brain function,

531
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,500
and the reasons that it
has such different effects

532
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,940
on insects, in other words,

533
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,810
it can kill them or prevent
them from reproducing,

534
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,750
and therefore explains why
plants probably evolved to have

535
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,463
this plant alkaloid, nicotine.

536
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,263
In humans,

537
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:26,010
because of the differences
in receptors for nicotine,

538
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,276
where they're located, and
the types of receptors,

539
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:31,380
the effects of nicotine on
humans is quite a bit different.

540
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,020
And again, it does not
cause infertility in humans.

541
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,090
Although I will talk a
little bit later about some

542
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,150
double blind peer-reviewed
studies conducted in humans

543
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,640
that indicate that for instance,

544
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,280
nicotine can reduce penile girth,

545
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,480
that is the girth of the penis,

546
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,720
and can lead to certain
forms of sexual dysfunction.

547
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,900
And those changes are
largely downstream of changes

548
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,020
in blood flow and
endothelial cell function.

549
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,750
Endothelial cells are the cells
that make up blood vessels

550
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,960
and other vascular type tissues
within the brain and body.

551
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
So nicotine is found in these plants.

552
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,460
And what we can know for sure is

553
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,980
that at some point in human evolution,

554
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,960
somebody or some group of people,

555
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,360
either, and here, I'm completely guessing,

556
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,490
it's a just so story,

557
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,200
but someone or some group must
have inhaled the smoke from

558
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,710
the tobacco plant or put the dried leaves

559
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,040
of the tobacco plant
against some mucosal tissue,

560
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,930
and you know the different
mucosal linings of their body

561
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,170
by which substances can
pass through, that's right.

562
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,500
Any of the mucosal soft
lining tissues of the body

563
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,210
will allow certain substances,

564
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,010
not all certain substances to pass in.

565
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,356
That's why people can put
tobacco in their mouth

566
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:41,189
and a certain amount of nicotine makes it

567
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:42,022
into the bloodstream,

568
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:43,334
put tobacco up their nose,

569
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,420
certain amount of nicotine
gets into the bloodstream.

570
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,150
I haven't heard of people
putting tobacco in other orifices

571
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,710
of their body containing mucosal tissue.

572
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,750
And I'm certainly not
suggesting people do that,

573
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,800
but you get the idea

574
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,870
and how nicotine gets from these plants,

575
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,543
these dried leaves into the bloodstream.

576
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,310
Burning tobacco leads
to a heat induced change

577
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,050
in the availability of nicotine.

578
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,390
And this is why smoking tobacco

579
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,670
or vaping tobacco,
simply by heating it up,

580
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,990
allows the nicotine to be
liberated and go into the

581
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,360
bloodstream simply by
inhaling it into the lungs.

582
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,150
We will get back to smoking
of various kinds later.

583
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,410
But right now let's just keep
our attention on how nicotine

584
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,890
is pulled from these plants
and into the human body.

585
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,520
Now whether by inhalation
or whether or not by placing

586
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,770
in contact with the
mucosal tissue of the mouth

587
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,060
or other mucosal containing
orifice of the body,

588
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,340
the nicotine then gets
into the bloodstream.

589
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,320
And once it's in the bloodstream,

590
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,840
it only exerts its
effects because it binds

591
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,233
to certain so-called nicotinic receptors.

592
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,050
So the nicotinic receptors

593
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,840
are of the acetylcholinergic variety.

594
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,120
I know this is a lot to think
about and a lot to hear if you

595
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,100
haven't heard about this, but
it's actually quite simple.

596
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,720
Anyone can understand this.

597
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,170
Acetylcholine is a molecule,

598
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,760
a chemical that is that's
released in the brain and body.

599
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,680
And when it binds to receptors,

600
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,690
that is little parking spots on cells,

601
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,910
it changes the way those cells behave.

602
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,890
Those cells can increase their activity

603
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,940
and release other chemicals.

604
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,260
They can become electrically active,

605
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,140
they can do any number
of different things.

606
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,690
When we ingest nicotine,

607
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,583
it gets into the bloodstream
and eventually some of that

608
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,130
will get into the brain and
some of it gets into the body.

609
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,660
And in both of the brain and body,

610
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,720
there are the so-called nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors.

611
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,290
Now the so-called family,
and indeed they are a family,

612
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,870
this is how we refer
to groups of receptors

613
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,800
of related design and genetic
background just like humans.

614
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,620
You have a family of these
acetylcholine receptors

615
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,940
that are of the nicotinic variety.

616
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,920
So maybe on one street
in your neighborhood,

617
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,480
you know the Joneses and another street,

618
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,000
you know the Chows and another
street, well in your body,

619
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,160
you have the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors,

620
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,993
and then you have the so-called

621
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,160
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

622
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,210
Today it's really simple.

623
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,550
Nicotine only binds to the
nicotinic acetylcholine

624
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,680
receptors and there are
a bunch of different ones

625
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,210
on a bunch of different tissues.

626
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,350
And the differences in those
receptors dictate what sorts of

627
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,430
effects the nicotine will
have on those tissues.

628
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,050
So let's talk about
what those effects are,

629
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,540
and let's do that by dividing
the effects of nicotine

630
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,130
into effects on the brain,

631
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,650
so everything from the
neck up, and on the body,

632
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,140
the so-called central nervous
system and the periphery.

633
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,550
Although I want to point
out that your spinal cord

634
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,780
is part of the central nervous system.

635
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,360
So in fairness to the reality,

636
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,420
your brain and spinal cord are
all central nervous system.

637
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,910
Everything else is
considered the periphery.

638
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,410
Now there are a lot of different nicotinic

639
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,730
acetylcholine receptors,

640
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,340
but for those of you that
want to know, you aficionados,

641
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,770
or if you're ultra curious about this,

642
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,520
the main effects of nicotine
in the brain are mediated

643
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,010
by nicotine binding to the so-called

644
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,770
alpha four beta two receptor.

645
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,140
Alpha four beta two receptor.

646
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,570
Even if you don't care
about receptor subtypes,

647
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,430
that's going to come up
later when we discuss

648
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,370
why nicotine suppresses appetite.

649
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,130
In fact, one of the major
reasons why people don't want

650
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,770
to quit smoking, or they quit smoking

651
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,570
or another form of ingesting nicotine,

652
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,130
and then they relapse,

653
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,550
they go back to smoking or
ingesting nicotine in some other

654
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,840
way is because indeed nicotine
will increase metabolism

655
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
and reduce hunger in large part

656
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
by binding to this alpha
four beta two receptor

657
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,960
in a particular area of the brain.

658
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,100
We're going to return
to that in a little bit,

659
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,070
but if you've ever heard that
nicotine kills the appetite,

660
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,450
indeed it does.

661
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,629
It's not the behavior of smoking itself.

662
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,462
It's not because you
always have a cigarette

663
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:32,070
in your mouth that you're
not eating more food.

664
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,260
Although I suppose that
might be a minor effect.

665
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,530
There are direct effects of
nicotine on both appetite,

666
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,960
that is, it reduces
appetite and direct effects

667
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,970
on metabolism, that is,

668
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,020
it increases metabolism
through its effects

669
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,610
on some other areas of the brain and body

670
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,687
we'll talk about in a moment.

671
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,250
Now within the brain,

672
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,270
nicotine binds to this
alpha four beta two receptor

673
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,920
in various locations in the brain.

674
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,070
And there are three and maybe
a fourth that we'll talk about

675
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,580
neurochemical effects of
nicotine after you ingest it.

676
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,660
First things first,

677
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,950
when you ingest nicotine

678
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,400
by smoking nicotine containing tobacco,

679
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,870
or if you place tobacco in
contact with the mucosal lining

680
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,180
of the nasal passages of the mouth,

681
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,170
takes about two to 15
minutes for that nicotine

682
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,003
to enter the bloodstream.

683
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:20,490
Smoking hits the bloodstream
faster, vaping even faster,

684
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,420
I should mention for a
variety of reasons and placing

685
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,420
tobacco directly in contact
with the mucosal lining

686
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,800
is going to be the slowest.

687
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,970
Now as I mentioned before,

688
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,850
nicotine gets into the bloodstream
and then because nicotine

689
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,690
can pass through the so-called
blood brain barrier, the BBB,

690
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,090
which is basically a
fence around the brain,

691
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,340
because it can pass through
the blood brain barrier,

692
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,560
it's going to have very
rapid effects on the brain

693
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,660
in these four major categories

694
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,870
of neurochemicals and neural circuits.

695
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,110
The first of those categories,
this is a very important one,

696
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,210
this is one that was brought
up in the episode on dopamine,

697
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,920
motivation, and drive.

698
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,240
And I think not just all scientists,

699
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,240
but all human beings should
know that within their brain,

700
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,240
they have what is called the
mesolimbic reward pathway.

701
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,500
The mesolimbic reward pathway
if you just want to call it,

702
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,070
the dopamine reward pathway
is, as the name suggests,

703
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,990
a set of connections between a brain area

704
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,520
called the ventral tegmental area.

705
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,500
You don't have to remember
the names of these things,

706
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,780
of course, but if you
want to, that's fine too.

707
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,130
The ventral tegmental area

708
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,860
or VTA connects to another area called

709
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,900
the nucleus accumbens.

710
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,460
Now here's what's very important.

711
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,450
Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine

712
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,680
from the nucleus accumbens.

713
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,770
This is what gives nicotine
its rewarding properties.

714
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,150
It increases motivation.

715
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,270
It tends to give a not so subtle,

716
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,640
but very transient increase in feelings

717
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,760
of wellbeing and alertness and motivation.

718
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,800
And that's because of
the increase in dopamine

719
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,583
caused by nicotine directly
within the nucleus accumbens.

720
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,320
Nicotine also triggers the
release of certain neurochemicals

721
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,510
from the ventral tegmental area itself.

722
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,850
And those impinge on nucleus accumbens

723
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,220
and increase dopamine levels further.

724
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,100
This is what makes the rewarding
properties or sometimes

725
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,830
referred to as the reinforcing
properties of nicotine

726
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,730
so powerful.

727
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,110
This is why so many billions
of people ingest nicotine

728
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,130
in one form or another.

729
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,120
It's also why nicotine is so hard to quit

730
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,850
because there's a potent
increase in dopamine

731
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,100
from multiple neural circuit pathways

732
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,340
within this mesolimbic reward circuitry.

733
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,070
Now within the mesolimbic
reward circuitry,

734
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,970
there's an interesting feature.

735
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,700
There are accelerators
that essentially push out

736
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,920
more dopamine, get more dopamine released,

737
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,830
and there are breaks of the
so-called GABAergic variety.

738
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,960
GABA's an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

739
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,360
You don't need to know too much
about it to just understand

740
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,660
that nicotine both increases dopamine,

741
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,380
but also decreases the activity of GABA.

742
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,480
And so this is like
pushing on the accelerator

743
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,690
for dopamine, but also removing the brake.

744
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,960
So there's a two pronged
effect of nicotine

745
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,320
on reinforcement reward
dopamine related pathways,

746
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,990
the feel good motivation pathways.

747
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,520
And that is an increase in
dopamine and a decrease in GABA.

748
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,353
And again,

749
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:11,370
that's all mediated through
this mesolimbic reward pathway,

750
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,290
involving the ventral tegmental area

751
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,700
and the nucleus accumbens.

752
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,900
So if you can conceptualize

753
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,300
even just 5% of what I just told you,

754
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,300
or even if you can just remember
nicotine increases dopamine

755
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,520
and that's why it feels so good,

756
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,690
it makes you want more of it,

757
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,690
you will have everything you
need to know in mind in order

758
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,690
to understand both why
nicotine is so highly used,

759
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,220
and indeed abused, why
it's so hard to quit,

760
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,780
and that will point to avenues

761
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,120
as to how to quit or reduce intake.

762
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,700
And it also points to
how nicotine can actually

763
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,690
be used in an antidepressant
way should you choose.

764
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,150
And we will talk about
what the various criteria

765
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,380
are for choosing that,

766
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,070
but just to understand
nicotine increases motivation,

767
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,710
it decreases negative feelings of mood,

768
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,470
it increases positive feelings
of mood and motivation.

769
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,690
Before we continue with
today's discussion,

770
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,790
I'd like to just briefly
acknowledge our sponsor

771
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,000
Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

772
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,250
Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,

773
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,710
is an all in one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink

774
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,770
that also has adaptogens
and digestive enzymes.

775
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,500
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since way back in 2012.

776
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,930
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

777
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,940
The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason I

778
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,720
still drink Athletic Greens
twice a day is that it supplies

779
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,780
total foundational coverage of
my vitamin and mineral needs.

780
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,170
And it supplies important
nutrients that I need to support

781
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,990
my gut microbiome, the gut
microbiome, as many of you know,

782
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,100
supports the immune system.

783
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,140
It also supports the
so-called gut brain access,

784
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,510
which is vital for
mood, for energy levels,

785
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,770
for regulating focus,

786
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,630
and many other features
of our mental health

787
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,940
and physical health that
impact our daily performance

788
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,840
and high performance

789
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,970
in any endeavors we might be involved in.

790
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,350
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

791
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,020
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

792
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,610
and claim a special offer.

793
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,500
They're giving away five
free travel packs plus

794
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,190
a year's supply of vitamin
D3K2 with every order.

795
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,023
And of course,

796
00:32:00,023 --> 00:32:02,790
vitamin D3K2 are vital for
all sorts of things like

797
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,830
hormone health and metabolic health and K2

798
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,080
for cardiovascular health
and calcium regulation.

799
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,290
Again, you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman

800
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,820
to claim that special offer.

801
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,490
The second major effect that
nicotine has in the brain

802
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,130
is that it increases acetylcholine.

803
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,920
Acetylcholine is a
neuromodulator that exists in you

804
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,580
and me, it is released from
multiple sites in the brain.

805
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,450
And the two major sites
are the nucleus basalis,

806
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,690
so these are a collection
of neurons in the front

807
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,020
and base of your brain, and
from some brain stem areas.

808
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,490
And there are a bunch of different ones

809
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,690
back there in your brain stem,

810
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,390
which is indeed in the back
that release acetylcholine

811
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:42,450
that include the locus coeruleus
as kind of a minor site,

812
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,340
the pedunculopontine nucleus.

813
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,770
There are a bunch of
these different areas,

814
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,270
that parabigeminal nucleus.

815
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,830
There are a bunch of
these things back there.

816
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,300
We don't have to go into all the names,

817
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,760
but just understand that they're
little pockets of neurons,

818
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,980
nerve cells located in
the front and the back

819
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,540
and some extent in the
middle of your brain,

820
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,460
but really in the front
and the back of your brain,

821
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,990
that can serve two major
role, here they are.

822
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,200
Acetylcholine released from
nucleus basalis leads to

823
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,630
a sort of spotlighting or highlighting

824
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,820
of particular neural
circuits in the brain.

825
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,653
What do I mean by this?

826
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,850
Well let's say you're working on a puzzle.

827
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,960
Let's say it's a cognitive puzzle.

828
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,580
Maybe you're doing a word puzzle,

829
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,560
or nowadays I've heard
of this Wordle thing.

830
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,030
I'm on Twitter and
people are always posting

831
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,920
their Wordle thing and I
have no idea what it is,

832
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,600
but I'm guessing it's some sort of puzzle.

833
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,070
I'm guessing it's like a crossword puzzle,

834
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,810
and here, if I'm wrong,
I don't know, educate me.

835
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,680
Tell me what Wordle is.

836
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,940
Somebody put it in the comments

837
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,220
and tell me if I should play it or not.

838
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,063
Here's the deal.

839
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,900
When acetylcholine is
released from nucleus basalis,

840
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,450
the neurons are there in
the base of the brain,

841
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,040
but they extend axons,

842
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,110
which are like little wires
elsewhere in the brain.

843
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,060
And when acetylcholine is released,

844
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,730
it tends to be released at
particular locations in the brain

845
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,620
that are associated with whatever activity

846
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,520
we happen to be doing.

847
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,380
So if I'm doing Wordle,

848
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,240
here I'm talking about it
as if I've ever done it,

849
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,040
doing a crossword puzzle or Wordle,

850
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,080
well the neurons that were
involved in trying to figure out

851
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,930
the solution to that Wordle or
crossword puzzle are active,

852
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,660
and then acetylcholine is
released from the little wires,

853
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,540
the little endings of these
cells in nucleus basalis.

854
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,510
And all of a sudden those
neural circuits get a boost.

855
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,117
They become more active,
and believe it or not,

856
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,670
our ability to perform
that crossword puzzle

857
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,159
or at least focus on that Wordle

858
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,079
or crossword puzzle gets enhanced.

859
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,780
It literally increases
our attention for that

860
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,820
and not anything else is enhanced.

861
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,010
So it's literally like a neurochemical

862
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,840
attentional spotlight.

863
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,500
Nicotine increases
acetylcholine and thereby focus

864
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,480
and concentration and mental performance,

865
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,060
not by changing the neural circuits

866
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,800
that are activated per se,

867
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,980
but rather by making more acetylcholine

868
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,620
available at those release sites.

869
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,380
So it's as if the
spotlight got more intense,

870
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,380
the highlighter is more intense
than it would be otherwise.

871
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,179
And I should also mention because

872
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,829
of the so-called pharmacokinetics,

873
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,980
the time course in which
nicotine has its effects,

874
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,270
which are pretty short lived,

875
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,770
we'll talk about those in a moment,

876
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,080
this enhancement in cognitive performance

877
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,420
and attention, it's going
to be very transient,

878
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,870
probably on the order of
about 30, maybe 45 minutes,

879
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,010
the half life of nicotine,

880
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,230
depending on how it's ingested and whether

881
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,410
or not you have food in the gut

882
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,120
and what else is in the
bloodstream, et cetera,

883
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,490
it's going to be anywhere
from one to two hours,

884
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,380
but typically the effects
of nicotine will come on

885
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,960
in about two to 15 minutes
as I mentioned before,

886
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,470
and then will last anywhere
from about 30 to 45 minutes.

887
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,030
This is why in the old days,

888
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,460
and still to some extent in
certain areas of the world,

889
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,260
but less so in the United States

890
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,120
and certainly in Europe as well,

891
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,700
we don't see quite as many
people smoking cigarettes,

892
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,890
for reasons we can discuss later.

893
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,170
But you would see these chain smokers

894
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,810
who are trying to maintain constant levels

895
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,030
of nicotine in their
brain and bloodstream.

896
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,820
Now perhaps they didn't know that nicotine

897
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,350
has this one to two hour half life,

898
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,710
but they could sense
no doubt the cognitive

899
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,000
and the physical effects of nicotine,

900
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,890
including this cognitive
enhancement effect

901
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,290
and highlighting of
neural circuits effect.

902
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,630
And they would notice they
would smoke a cigarette

903
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,750
and then for the next five
to 45 minutes have heightened

904
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,130
focus and then they
would start to drop off.

905
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,180
So they smoke another cigarette.

906
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,013
So in other words,

907
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:07,350
they're trying to maintain
a constant level of nicotine

908
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,330
for whatever activities
they needed to perform.

909
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,800
Obviously chain smoking

910
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,590
because of the terrible
effects of smoking,

911
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,547
I'll talk about those terrible effects,

912
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,940
but I'm sure you've heard
of them before, cancer,

913
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,670
depletion of just about
every organ and body tissue

914
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,830
to the point that it
can actually be measured

915
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,720
how many years of your
life you're peeling off

916
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,360
in terms of lifespan and
health span by smoking.

917
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,410
Well the terrible effects
of smoking are indisputable,

918
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,460
but the positive effects of
nicotine on this circuitry,

919
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,830
part of the reason why
people would chain smoke

920
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,500
in the first place rather
than get one big peak

921
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,750
of concentration and focus
and then just let it disappear

922
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,013
after 45 minutes.

923
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,460
So what we have is a
scenario where dopamine

924
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,590
is going up in the mesolimbic pathway.

925
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,410
That's why smoking or ingesting
nicotine in any other way

926
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,690
feels good and makes us feel motivated.

927
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,280
And then the increase in acetylcholine,

928
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,620
especially from nucleus basalis
in the front of the brain,

929
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,380
is the reason why it
can increase our ability

930
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,260
to focus on particular types of endeavors,

931
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,850
particular mental work that we're doing,

932
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,710
or maybe even particular physical work.

933
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,200
Although I should mention
anytime I'm pairing the words

934
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,820
nicotine and physical work,

935
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,740
it's obvious that because of the ways

936
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,260
that smoking impairs lung function,

937
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,410
those two things really
run counter to one another.

938
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,243
In other words,

939
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:21,990
if you are thinking about
ingesting nicotine through smoking

940
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,713
or vaping in order to
improve physical performance,

941
00:37:24,713 --> 00:37:26,460
that's a terrible idea.

942
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,440
The logic isn't there
and the health detriments

943
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,273
are certainly there.

944
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:32,670
The third neurochemical pathway
that's strongly activated

945
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,050
when nicotine is brought into
the central nervous system

946
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,010
into the brain is epinephrine,

947
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,330
or in particular norepinephrine,

948
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,620
which is related to epinephrine.

949
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,230
Now, earlier I said epinephrine
is the same as adrenaline.

950
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,310
That's still true.

951
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,320
Norepinephrine is closely
related to epinephrine,

952
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,460
and for today's discussion,

953
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,900
we're going to use them interchangeably.

954
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,210
Although I realize as I say that

955
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,250
that the medical students
and some biology students are

956
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,900
probably going to have a minor seizure

957
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,120
when I lump norepinephrine
and epinephrine.

958
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't do that to be
too much of a lumper,

959
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,860
in science, we talk about
lumpers and splitters.

960
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,080
Lumpers are people that like
to oversimplify a little bit,

961
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,970
splitters are people that
really like to detail.

962
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,890
You'll see a lot of
splitters on social media

963
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,390
from time to time, they'll say, wait,

964
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,140
you didn't mention the alpha
two beta six receptor yet.

965
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,610
Okay look, I get it.

966
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,130
And I am all for having
splitters in the room,

967
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,930
but for sake of today's discussion

968
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,020
and for ease of digestibility
of some of this,

969
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,580
just want to point out
that norepinephrine,

970
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,840
epinephrine, and adrenaline,

971
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,990
I'm going to treat as a common
pool of similar, in fact,

972
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,740
very similar molecules that
all have the same net effect,

973
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,240
at least in the context of this discussion

974
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,650
and that's to increase levels

975
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,050
of alertness, energy, and arousal.

976
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,720
And the way that nicotine
accomplishes those increases in

977
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,170
alertness and arousal and
energy within the brain is by

978
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,030
triggering the release of
no epinephrine from a little

979
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,440
cluster of neurons in
the back of the brain

980
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
called locus coeruleus,

981
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,620
tiny cluster of neurons that
offers up, or I should say has,

982
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,020
because they're always there from birth

983
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,080
has these little wires,
these axons that extend many,

984
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,820
many places in the brain, not every place,

985
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,050
but virtually every place

986
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,480
and can sprinkler the
brain with norepinephrine,

987
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,520
essentially serve as a wake up signal,

988
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,320
elevating levels of energy.

989
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,728
And when that combines
with the acetylcholine

990
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:14,070
from nucleus basalis, which
causes attentional spotlighting,

991
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,530
increases in concentration and focus,

992
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,137
and with the feel good
properties of dopamine

993
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:21,630
and the motivating properties
of dopamine released

994
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,760
from the mesolimbic reward pathway.

995
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,420
Now you can start to get
a picture of why nicotine

996
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,180
is such a powerful molecule.

997
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,070
It's making people feel
motivated and good.

998
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,820
It's making people feel focused
and it makes people feel

999
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,490
alert when they would otherwise
feel a little bit sleepy.

1000
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,670
So this is a really
powerful compound, in fact,

1001
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,980
going back to our earlier
discussion about focus

1002
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,150
and some tools for focus,

1003
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,530
and I encourage you if you're interested

1004
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,090
to please check out the episode on focus,

1005
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,770
there are a number of different tools

1006
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,690
and protocols there to increase focus.

1007
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,580
But here we are talking
about one molecule, nicotine,

1008
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,220
found in plants like tomatoes and potatoes

1009
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,810
and the tobacco plant.

1010
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,870
And it can be synthesized
in a laboratory and ingested

1011
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,350
through a patch or a gum or even a pill

1012
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,480
or a toothpick dipped in nicotine.

1013
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,480
One molecule that can trigger
activation of all the circuits

1014
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,140
for focus and motivation
in one fell swoop.

1015
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,170
That is remarkable. That
is absolutely remarkable.

1016
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,190
And here we haven't even touched on

1017
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,200
some of the psychological
components of focus, right?

1018
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,640
Whether or not we're
interested in something,

1019
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,920
whether or not we're
excited about it or not.

1020
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,380
This is a very, very powerful system.

1021
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,030
So powerful in fact,

1022
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,890
that I think we can really place nicotine

1023
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,020
right up there at the top,

1024
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,080
right next to caffeine as the molecule

1025
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,280
that has fundamentally
changed human evolution,

1026
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,770
human consciousness, and human experience.

1027
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,380
Even if you're somebody who's
never ingested nicotine,

1028
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,820
this absolutely has to be true

1029
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,740
because you have these
nicotinic receptors,

1030
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,560
which is to say that acetylcholine
that's naturally released

1031
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,920
without any external trigger
within your brain and body,

1032
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,753
or I should say

1033
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:02,340
without any trigger from
nicotine in particular

1034
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,520
is binding these nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors

1035
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,830
and is creating these effects
in your brain and body,

1036
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,480
just absolutely staggering.

1037
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,750
Now earlier I mentioned the
appetite suppressing and indeed

1038
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,630
metabolism increasing effects of nicotine.

1039
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,210
And while that's a fairly niche component

1040
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,580
of what nicotine does, I
mean, it's an important one,

1041
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,320
but it's not the major reason

1042
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,937
why most people consume nicotine.

1043
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:25,980
I'd like to take a moment
and talk about that now,

1044
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,960
because we are in the
brain and we're talking

1045
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,277
about the effects of
nicotine in the brain.

1046
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:31,260
And so it seems to me the appropriate time

1047
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,160
to talk about this.

1048
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,530
Now we can have this
conversation about nicotine

1049
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,570
and appetite and
metabolism in a very simple

1050
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,070
and straightforward way.

1051
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:42,240
If you'd like to learn more
about the biology of metabolism

1052
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,950
and appetite and how those things

1053
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,230
are mediated by neural components,

1054
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,240
so not just stuff like
your liver, et cetera,

1055
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,260
we have episodes on that,

1056
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,200
but really the neural components
of hunger and appetite.

1057
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,550
I encourage you to check out our episode

1058
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,290
on hunger and appetite.

1059
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:58,230
But in that episode, we had a discussion.

1060
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,290
And it's one that I'll just
briefly summarize now that you

1061
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,330
have a collection of neurons
that sits right above the roof

1062
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,856
of your mouth or so
called the hypothalamus.

1063
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:08,580
Hypo means below and
thalamus is right above it,

1064
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,540
hypothalamus.

1065
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,240
So the small collection of
neurons in the hypothalamus

1066
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,600
to a number of different
things related to sex behavior,

1067
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,660
aggression, mediating the
temperature of your body,

1068
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,140
et cetera, but also appetite
and suppressing appetite.

1069
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,250
And within the hypothalamus,

1070
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,160
there's a compact collection
of these little neurons,

1071
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,010
which we referred to as
the POMC, P-O-M-C neurons.

1072
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,000
And the name comes from the fact

1073
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,230
that they express certain peptides.

1074
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,760
And we won't get into that now,

1075
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,230
but the POMC neurons have
a very profound impact on

1076
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,670
whether or not you feel hungry

1077
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,040
or whether or not you do not feel hungry,

1078
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,410
whether or not your
appetite is suppressed.

1079
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:45,570
It turns out that when nicotine
gets into the bloodstream

1080
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,860
and then into the brain,

1081
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,640
some of that nicotine binds to nicotinic

1082
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,850
alpha four beta two containing
nicotinic receptors.

1083
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,200
Again, these sub units of receptors,

1084
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,490
but basically the nicotine binds some

1085
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,080
of those parking spots, parks there.

1086
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,070
And as a consequence,

1087
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,450
these POMC neurons increase
their electrical activity

1088
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,730
and appetite is suppressed.

1089
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,090
And that's because the POMC
neurons have outputs to various

1090
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,670
areas of the brain and
body controlling everything

1091
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,210
from how full we feel to whether or not

1092
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,400
our blood sugar goes up or down,

1093
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,160
which can impact our hunger,
and believe it or not,

1094
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,650
whether or not we have a
tendency to want to move the jaw

1095
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,750
of our mouth in order to chew food.

1096
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:25,830
Yes, believe it or not,

1097
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,290
the neural circuitry
associated with appetite and

1098
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,750
suppression of appetite actually dictates

1099
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,700
whether or not you prefer to,

1100
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,460
or I should say are more
biased or less biased

1101
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,460
to moving your mouth, that is chewing.

1102
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,680
Which makes perfect
sense when you hear it.

1103
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,760
One way to suppress appetite

1104
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,850
is to sew the jaw shut neurally,

1105
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,350
or at least make it less likely

1106
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,720
to open your mouth and put food in it.

1107
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,220
Actually that reminded me of a story.

1108
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,620
I'll just interrupt myself
to tell a brief story that

1109
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,230
there's a famous Nobel Laureate
who won the Nobel Prize

1110
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,908
for something totally
distant from appetite.

1111
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:00,570
But once turned to a friend
of mine at a meeting and said,

1112
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,570
I discovered the biological
mechanism for losing weight.

1113
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,493
And my friend said, well of course,

1114
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,370
ingest fewer calories than you burn.

1115
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,300
Calories in, calories out,

1116
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,972
fundamental rule of thermodynamics.

1117
00:44:13,972 --> 00:44:16,230
And basically the fundamental
rule of weight loss,

1118
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,120
weight gain, or weight maintenance.

1119
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,590
And he said, no,

1120
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,480
it's actually the gene

1121
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,940
that controls whether or
not you open your mouth.

1122
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,830
Now he was making a very nerdy joke.

1123
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,570
So if you didn't register that as a joke,

1124
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,930
that's about as funny as
neuroscience or biology jokes get.

1125
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:31,830
There are a couple funnier ones,

1126
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,660
but that one's kind of
considered on the funnier side.

1127
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,510
So this is why we're not
considered comedians.

1128
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,510
But the point of the matter is
that whether or not you crave

1129
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,580
or desire or impulsively
want to put things

1130
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,510
in your mouth and chew it,

1131
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,760
will actually dictate how
many calories that you eat.

1132
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,490
And so I find it remarkable
and indeed important to know

1133
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,890
that these POMC neurons
are actually inhibiting

1134
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,170
the opening and the movement
of the mouth for chewing.

1135
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,270
So when we smoke or
when we ingest nicotine

1136
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,470
in any other way,

1137
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,750
you activate these POMC
neurons, you suppress appetite,

1138
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,880
but in part you do that
by actually limiting

1139
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,320
the impulse to chew.

1140
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,940
Incredible, at least to me.

1141
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,130
Now in addition to limiting appetite

1142
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,370
by changing one's desire
to ingest food and chew it

1143
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:14,100
and actual craving of food by regulation

1144
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,420
of blood sugar, et cetera,

1145
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,530
there do seem to be some quite
direct effects of nicotine

1146
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,970
on metabolism,

1147
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,340
and the effects on
metabolism aren't enormous.

1148
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,110
These are increases in metabolism

1149
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,830
that are about 2% up to about 5%,

1150
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,750
but I want to emphasize that those

1151
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,930
are transient increases in metabolism.

1152
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,440
Nonetheless, people that
quit smoking often find

1153
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,810
that their appetite goes up,
they sometimes gain weight.

1154
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,940
They sometimes do not depending
on whether or not they

1155
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,370
offset that increase in
appetite with increased physical

1156
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,310
exercise or with decrease
food intake in other ways.

1157
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,080
But there does seem to
be this direct effect

1158
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,090
of ingesting nicotine on metabolism,

1159
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,470
which I find is interesting

1160
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,940
because if you look in the literature,

1161
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,090
one of the reasons why
people are reluctant

1162
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,540
to quit ingesting
nicotine, if for instance,

1163
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,650
they want to quit using the
delivery device to nicotine

1164
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,870
that's causing such problems
for their health like smoking

1165
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,740
or vaping or whether or
not they find themselves

1166
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,360
quote unquote addicted to,

1167
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,480
or have the habit of ingesting nicotine.

1168
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,080
In part, that's likely due
to be the dopamine effects,

1169
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,180
because dopamine is highly
reinforcing and rewarding.

1170
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,400
It feels good, so people
want to do more of it.

1171
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,550
But it's also that for many
people and here the data really

1172
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,640
point to the fact that a lot
of the younger female smokers

1173
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,930
or younger female vapers,
or when I say that,

1174
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,040
of course I mean younger
females that vape,

1175
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,750
are doing that because they like

1176
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,280
the appetite suppressing effects,

1177
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,350
which of course opens up
an entire conversation

1178
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,290
about the sociology of
body imagery, et cetera,

1179
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,210
a topic for a future podcast.

1180
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,530
So nicotine has certain effects
on the brain by virtue of

1181
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,390
the fact that nicotine binds

1182
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,400
these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

1183
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,110
And those receptors are found on some,

1184
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,240
but not all neural
circuits within the brain.

1185
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,550
And we talked about some of
them already, mesolimbic,

1186
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,380
the POMC neurons, et cetera.

1187
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,910
Now when we ingest nicotine,

1188
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,690
it goes from the bloodstream
to all the tissues

1189
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,770
and organs of the body.

1190
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,750
How does it do that? I mean, amazing.

1191
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,630
It can pass to everything,
the brain, the body,

1192
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,050
it does that because
nicotine is fat soluble.

1193
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,910
And now when anytime
people hear the word fat,

1194
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,700
they tend to think about
body fat, subcutaneous fat,

1195
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,860
or maybe they think about dietary fat.

1196
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,650
What I mean by fat soluble in
the context of nicotine being

1197
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,280
fat soluble is that the cells of your body

1198
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,670
have an outer layer,
so-called outer membrane.

1199
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,800
And it's made up of lipid, of fat,

1200
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
very particular types of lipids in fact.

1201
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,850
Nicotine has this remarkable
ability to move through

1202
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,680
that fatty tissue.

1203
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,370
Not all molecules have that
ability, but nicotine does.

1204
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,830
So it can move relatively
freely through the brain

1205
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,250
and body and relatively
freely from outside of cells,

1206
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,280
extracellular space to
intracellular space.

1207
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,290
So it can get into cells, it
can do that within the brain.

1208
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,340
We talked about those effects

1209
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,230
and it can do that within the body.

1210
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,300
Now anytime we're talking about the body,

1211
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,830
we can be talking about
any number of things,

1212
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,110
but today I'm going to
refer to the periphery

1213
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,880
and the body in more or less the same way,

1214
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,753
but keep in mind in the back
of your head, pun intended,

1215
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,130
you have your brain, your
eyes, and the spinal cord.

1216
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,770
And those three things make up
your central nervous system.

1217
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,720
The peripheral nervous
system and the periphery,

1218
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,130
which is the rest of your body,

1219
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,290
the contain your organs
and so forth outside

1220
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,580
of the nervous system,

1221
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,740
things like your liver and
your stomach, et cetera,

1222
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,590
that's what we're going to
talk about now because nicotine

1223
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,410
has profound effects on
the organs of the body

1224
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,820
that are separate from,

1225
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,580
but that occur in
parallel at the same time

1226
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,130
as the effects of nicotine on the brain.

1227
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,080
So let's talk about what
some of those effects are.

1228
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,030
When nicotine makes it into
the bloodstream, again,

1229
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,130
within two to 15 minutes of ingesting it,

1230
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,780
depending on the delivery device,

1231
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,650
your heart rate will increase,

1232
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,293
blood pressure will increase,

1233
00:48:57,293 --> 00:49:00,120
and the contractibility
of the heart tissue

1234
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,920
will actually increase.

1235
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,580
So what that essentially
speaks to is an increase

1236
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,230
in so-called sympathetic tone.

1237
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:08,063
And when I say that,

1238
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:09,690
I don't mean an increase in sympathy

1239
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,463
for others of the emotional sort.

1240
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,750
What I mean is an increase
in the sympathetic activity

1241
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:18,060
of the sympathetic arm of
the autonomic nervous system,

1242
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,600
which is real mouthful
and mindful of ideas.

1243
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,810
But all you need to know is
that it's a generalized system

1244
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,650
that increases levels of
alertness and physical readiness.

1245
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:29,850
So it makes you ready for action,

1246
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:31,560
makes you ready for thought.

1247
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,510
It's balanced by a whole
other system called

1248
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,220
the parasympathetic nervous system,

1249
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,070
which is basically the so-called
rest and digest system,

1250
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,650
which is a system of neurons
and organs, et cetera,

1251
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,920
that put your body and your
brain into a state of not being

1252
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,250
able to think clearly, to
digest, and to fall asleep.

1253
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,650
So nicotine increases heart rate,

1254
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,600
blood pressure, and
contractibility of the heart.

1255
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,600
So it's going to cause
more blood flow in theory,

1256
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,080
although it also tends to
constrict blood vessels

1257
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,670
in many locations in the body.

1258
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,120
This explains the decrease
in penile girth effect

1259
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,560
of nicotine, in particular

1260
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,350
nicotine ingested by smoking or vaping.

1261
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:11,580
That's right, smoking and
vaping reduces penis size

1262
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,760
and also will have damaging effects

1263
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,180
on the blood lining endothelial tissue.

1264
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,120
So over time it actually is
impairing blood's ability to get

1265
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,280
to the penis chronically

1266
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,200
as well as to other organs of the body.

1267
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,840
But when people ingest nicotine acutely,

1268
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,300
and let's say they do
that by Nicorette patch

1269
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,460
or by toothpick dipped in nicotine,

1270
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,500
it will have some of these same effects,

1271
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,440
but when not smoking tobacco,

1272
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,330
when bringing nicotine
into the bloodstream

1273
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,830
through other mechanisms,

1274
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,500
many, if not all of the
disruption of the endothelial cell

1275
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,500
function can be bypassed, but
the effects on penile girth,

1276
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,080
the effects on reducing
blood flow to various tissues

1277
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,380
is still present during
the effects of nicotine,

1278
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,540
which as I mentioned last
about one to two hours.

1279
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,250
The half life is about one to two hours,

1280
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,810
depending on a number of factors,

1281
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,180
not interesting for today's discussion.

1282
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,490
So when nicotine gets
into the bloodstream,

1283
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:06,536
it's making us more alert,

1284
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:08,820
it's preparing our body for readiness.

1285
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,233
The heart is pumping harder.

1286
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,110
Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,

1287
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,790
is released from the adrenal glands,

1288
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,860
which right atop our kidneys.

1289
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,730
So everything is pointed
toward creating more readiness

1290
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,920
to move, more readiness to think.

1291
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,753
And again,

1292
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:25,560
this is happening in parallel
with all the effects of

1293
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,210
neurochemistry that are
happening with the brain

1294
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,730
that we talked about a few minutes ago.

1295
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,310
Now what's interesting about
nicotine is that while it

1296
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,500
causes this global increase in readiness

1297
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,230
and alertness and attention
and mood, et cetera,

1298
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:42,060
it also has the effect of
somewhat relaxing skeletal muscle.

1299
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,310
Now that might seem
counterintuitive to those of you out

1300
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,110
there that already know what I'm about

1301
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,560
to tell the rest of you who
didn't know it previously,

1302
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,870
that your muscles are able to

1303
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:56,870
contract because of the effects
of acetylcholine released

1304
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:01,620
from neurons in your spinal
cord that spit out acetylcholine

1305
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,963
onto the muscle and bind to what?

1306
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,210
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

1307
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,498
Put into plain English,

1308
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:10,530
nicotinic receptors are also the ways

1309
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,750
in which your muscles can get activated.

1310
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,583
So therefore,

1311
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:15,330
why would it be that increasing nicotine

1312
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,790
would cause relaxation of the muscles?

1313
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,160
And that has to do with some
of the neural circuits that are

1314
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,530
upstream of the muscles and
has to do with a little bit

1315
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,840
of how the autonomic
nervous system is a range

1316
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,520
in terms of which receptors go where,

1317
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,550
a topic and kind of rabbit
hole of a conversation

1318
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,380
far too deep for right now,

1319
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,990
at least in the context of
this already somewhat detailed

1320
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,940
discussion of the effects of nicotine.

1321
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,400
But if we were to zoom out and just think

1322
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,810
about the effects of nicotine,

1323
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,523
we now have a very clear picture.

1324
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,550
Reward pathways are turned on.

1325
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,610
Attention is turned on.
Alertness is turned on.

1326
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,980
You feel better than you
felt a few minutes ago.

1327
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,600
Your blood pressure is
up. Your heart rate is up.

1328
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,490
Your preparedness for
thinking is elevated as well.

1329
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,610
And yet your body is somewhat relaxed.

1330
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:06,060
That's a very interesting
state of mind and body.

1331
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:11,060
Interesting because it's somewhat
ideal for cognitive work.

1332
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,800
Like if you were going to sit
down and work on a book or you're

1333
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,350
going to sit down and try and
figure out a hard math problem,

1334
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,910
or you're going to write a
letter that's been really

1335
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,140
challenging for you to write,

1336
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,750
or maybe that you're
really excited to write,

1337
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,770
but that you've been

1338
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,870
slow to get out the door
for whatever reason.

1339
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,540
I'm talking about my own
habits of procrastination.

1340
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,520
Well that state of being very alert,

1341
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,400
but your body being relaxed is almost,

1342
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,330
if not the optimal state for
getting mental work done,

1343
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,280
because if you're feeling
agitated in your body

1344
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,480
and you want to physically move your body,

1345
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,800
it's very hard to do cognitive work.

1346
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,260
At least the sorts of cognitive
work that involve typing

1347
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,240
or writing or these sorts of things.

1348
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,001
It's also the exact opposite
of the optimal state

1349
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,680
for physical performance,

1350
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,375
which is one of yes, also alertness,

1351
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,740
yes, also motivation and elevated mood.

1352
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,740
That's all wonderful
stuff to have in mind,

1353
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,380
literally when you are
exercising or competing

1354
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,480
in sport or something of that sort.

1355
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,650
But under those conditions,

1356
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,190
you really also want to
have a fast reaction time,

1357
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,500
a low latency for muscle
activation so that you can make

1358
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,960
coordinated muscle movements
in the ways that you need to,

1359
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,720
which is of course what's
required of physical endeavors.

1360
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,010
That tells us a few things, first of all,

1361
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:20,220
it tells us that nicotine is
going to be generally a bad

1362
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,930
idea for a pre-workout tool

1363
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:28,380
or for enhancing physical performance,

1364
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,510
however, it's apt to be,

1365
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,490
and in fact is an excellent tool

1366
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,440
for enhancing cognitive ability.

1367
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,273
And of course,

1368
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:37,830
that triggers my mind to
return to the anecdote about

1369
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,070
my Nobel prize winning
colleague who ingests nicotine

1370
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,350
by way of nicotine containing gum in order

1371
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,450
to increase levels of cognitive focus.

1372
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,550
Certainly not for going
out and playing sport.

1373
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,000
In fact, despite the fact
that he is very, very tall,

1374
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,360
he often points to himself

1375
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,257
in an appropriately funny way that

1376
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:58,770
despite being on the basketball
team of his high school,

1377
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,990
he is probably the worst
player that ever existed.

1378
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,850
And they only positioned him
there because of his height.

1379
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:06,090
And I guess his head was
designed to prevent balls

1380
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,350
from entering the basket.

1381
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,193
In any event,

1382
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,010
nicotine does seem to be very good

1383
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,490
at enhancing cognitive function,
at least in the short term,

1384
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,740
which is not to say that it
isn't without its side effects,

1385
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,970
which we will talk about.

1386
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,803
And again,

1387
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:20,270
those are side effects that
are independent of smoking

1388
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,520
or vaping or other forms
of ingesting nicotine.

1389
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,780
For instance,

1390
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,580
dipping or chewing tobacco
is known to cause a 50 fold,

1391
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,150
yes, 50 fold increase in mouth cancers,

1392
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,360
things like leukoplakia and just generally

1393
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,470
is terrible for your health.

1394
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,490
I'm sorry to break it to you,

1395
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,310
but if you're dipping
or you're using snuff

1396
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,510
or things of that sort,

1397
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,370
certainly I'm not going
to tell people what to do.

1398
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,353
That's not my role in life,

1399
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:50,580
but you are dramatically
increasing the probability of an

1400
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,150
oral cancer or of a mucosal
lining cancer of some sort.

1401
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,197
So it's not just that smoking

1402
00:55:55,197 --> 00:55:56,910
and vaping are bad for your health.

1403
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,710
These other forms of delivery for nicotine

1404
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,907
can be bad for your health as well.

1405
00:55:59,907 --> 00:56:02,640
Now whether or not ingesting
nicotine by way of nicotine

1406
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,150
containing gum or patch or
toothpick or other method

1407
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:07,860
is dangerous,

1408
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,720
for other reasons is a discussion

1409
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,220
that's important, right now,

1410
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:16,220
it appears that provided the
dosages are kept reasonable.

1411
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,870
We'll talk about what
reasonable means a little later,

1412
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,660
and the frequency is kept relatively low.

1413
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,390
So not relying on these things constantly.

1414
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,223
There may in fact

1415
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:27,750
be some benefit to ingesting
nicotine from time to time,

1416
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,400
provided that you are not
still developing your brain.

1417
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,420
Now in reality,

1418
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,000
neuroplasticity goes on
throughout the lifetime.

1419
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,920
Your life is actually one
long developmental arc.

1420
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,290
It's not like development
occurs and then stops,

1421
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,200
but certainly for people
before puberty, during puberty,

1422
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,220
and probably for the next 15
to 20 years after puberty,

1423
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,830
avoiding nicotine is probably a good idea.

1424
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,260
Now of course, development
is your entire life.

1425
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,820
It's not like development
starts and then ends,

1426
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:58,140
but certainly for people that
are 25 years old or younger,

1427
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,840
ingesting nicotine as a way
to enhance cognitive function

1428
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,430
is probably not the best idea.

1429
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,990
And certainly, please,

1430
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,410
for those of you that are
15 years old or younger,

1431
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,150
ingesting nicotine in any form,

1432
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,590
unless it's prescribed by your doctor

1433
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,200
for a very specific clinical reason,

1434
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,300
to me seems just like a terrible idea

1435
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,040
based on all the data that I've read.

1436
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,740
And the reason for that is
it's going to create a scenario

1437
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,320
of nicotine dependence in order
to achieve heightened levels

1438
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,260
of mood and alertness, et
cetera, and that's bad.

1439
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,420
And what we're effectively talking about

1440
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,470
is an addiction for nicotine directly,

1441
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,750
not necessarily the delivery device method

1442
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,740
like smoking or vaping,

1443
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,840
although it could pull
that in as an addictive

1444
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,820
or habit forming behavior as well,

1445
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,830
but you want to let your
neural circuits develop

1446
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,930
to the point where again,

1447
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,808
unless there's a clinical
need for a prescribed drug

1448
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,700
from a licensed physician
or psychiatrist, et cetera,

1449
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,640
that you're not relying
on chemical enhancement

1450
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,098
of these circuits.

1451
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:53,910
For people who are 25
years or older, and again,

1452
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,700
that's not a strict cutoff,
but roughly 25 years or older,

1453
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,150
but for those of you that are
thinking about using nicotine

1454
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,060
to enhance cognitive function as adults

1455
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,060
and your brain development
is slowing down, right.

1456
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,893
Never ceases,

1457
00:58:06,893 --> 00:58:09,900
but is slowing down or has
slowed down to the point

1458
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,050
where we would say developmental
plasticity is largely over

1459
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:14,670
and you're now operating

1460
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:17,910
in the context of adult neuroplasticity.

1461
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:18,990
Well, in that case,

1462
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,670
there may be instances in which increasing

1463
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,060
acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,

1464
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,970
by way of nicotine ingestion
might be a good idea,

1465
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,920
but certainly not by smoking, vaping,

1466
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,910
or by direct contact of tobacco
to the mucosal lining tissue

1467
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,700
of the mouth or nose, so
called dipping or snuffing.

1468
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,050
For the last 20 minutes or so,

1469
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,910
we've been talking about
the biology of nicotine

1470
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,830
specifically, how it impacts the brain,

1471
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,990
how it impacts the body,
why it feels so good,

1472
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,490
why it can enhance focus.

1473
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:48,870
And we've largely set
aside smoking, vaping,

1474
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,030
dipping tobacco, and snuffing,

1475
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,640
and the negative effects
that those all have

1476
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,590
on mental and physical health.

1477
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:56,910
Working down from the top of the head

1478
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:01,020
to the bottom of the feet, we
can say that smoking, vaping,

1479
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,800
dipping, and snuffing negatively
impact every organ and

1480
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,220
tissue system and cell of the
body by virtue of the fact

1481
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:11,400
that they all damage
the endothelial cells.

1482
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,140
Again, the endothelial cells are the cells

1483
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,700
that make up the vasculature,

1484
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,150
which delivers blood and other nutrients

1485
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,060
to all the cells and organs
and tissues of the body.

1486
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,600
And those endothelial cells
are strongly and negatively

1487
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,693
impacted by all of the
practices that I just described.

1488
00:59:28,557 --> 00:59:29,390
Now the way that that happens

1489
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:32,670
varies a little bit from each
one to the next, for instance,

1490
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,160
it has been estimated
that cigarettes contain

1491
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,430
anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 toxins.

1492
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:40,440
Now the word toxins is a
real buzzword these days,

1493
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,550
you hear about detoxes and
toxins, but more specifically,

1494
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,920
we know that it contains carcinogens.

1495
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,410
These are cancer promoting compounds.

1496
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,460
For instance,

1497
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,790
we know that the tar in cigarettes,
even low tar cigarettes,

1498
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,740
as well as the ammonia within cigarettes,

1499
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,830
as well as the formaldehyde
contained within cigarettes,

1500
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:00,870
as well as the carbon
dioxide that's generated

1501
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:04,020
from smoking those cigarettes
are all carcinogens.

1502
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,290
Carbon dioxide also has the
negative effect of depleting

1503
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,600
the amount of oxygen that's
delivered to any and all

1504
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,540
of our tissues by way of the impact of

1505
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,680
carbon dioxide binding hemoglobin
and preventing hemoglobin

1506
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,470
from delivering oxygen to
the tissues of the body.

1507
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:23,490
So while there may be 4,000
or 4,500 or 7,000 toxins,

1508
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,660
depending on which cigarette,

1509
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,550
which papers they happen to be rolled in,

1510
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,380
whether or not they're
filtered or non-filtered,

1511
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,933
the type of tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,

1512
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,480
there are a tremendous number of toxins.

1513
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,850
And there are some very potent carcinogens

1514
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,890
within that long list of toxins.

1515
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:40,290
Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde,

1516
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,360
and carbon dioxide being the most potent

1517
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,710
of those carcinogens.

1518
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,690
Now the fact that there are
carcinogens in cigarettes

1519
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,270
sometimes lead cigarette
smokers and particularly the

1520
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,490
cigarette smokers that have
the hardest time quitting or

1521
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:53,010
that enjoy their cigarettes
the most from saying, well,

1522
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,140
listen, everything is a carcinogen
or everything kills you.

1523
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,800
Well certainly that's
not a true statement.

1524
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,500
And while there are other
carcinogens in the environment,

1525
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,380
so it environmental hazards like solvents.

1526
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,140
And even if you work in a
laboratory, for instance,

1527
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,900
we use in the laboratory,
DNA intercalating dyes,

1528
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,270
these are literally dyes
that allow us to see the DNA

1529
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,070
structure of cells and see the proteins

1530
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,200
they make and see the RNAs they make.

1531
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,520
And it's very important to wear gloves

1532
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,420
when you work with those things,

1533
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,229
because as the name
suggests, they intercalate,

1534
01:01:21,229 --> 01:01:22,590
they actually get in
between the strands of DNA

1535
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:23,700
and separate them.

1536
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,220
They are mutagens, they mutate DNA.

1537
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,870
They are often carcinogens as well.

1538
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,160
So we have them in our laboratory,

1539
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,710
but we take certain precautions
to not have them negatively

1540
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,143
impact our health, safety
protocols and so on.

1541
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:38,160
We hear that there are
carcinogens in car exhaust

1542
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,290
and bus exhaust and in all sorts of things

1543
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,300
like pesticides and that's all true.

1544
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,550
So in the argument of probabilities,

1545
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,480
one would say, well,

1546
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,090
if there are all these other
carcinogens in the environment,

1547
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:51,390
why would you compound
their carcinogenic effect

1548
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:54,510
by smoking or vaping
or dipping or snuffing?

1549
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,640
But that usually doesn't get
people to quit smoking or doing

1550
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,500
those things because of
the powerful reinforcing

1551
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,180
effects of nicotine itself.

1552
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,013
So again,

1553
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:03,300
nicotine is the reinforcing element by way

1554
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,030
of triggering that dopamine
reinforcement pathway,

1555
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,740
the mesolimbic reward pathway.

1556
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,400
And of course there are all
the other additional effects

1557
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,110
of increased focus,

1558
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:15,210
such as increased ability to pay attention

1559
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,337
to work or to others that
lead to other rewards.

1560
01:02:17,337 --> 01:02:20,010
And so then it becomes a
situation of compounding rewards.

1561
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,510
So it's not really about the cigarette,

1562
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,343
it's about the nicotine,

1563
01:02:22,343 --> 01:02:23,610
and it's not really about the nicotine,

1564
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,620
it's about the dopamine
that the nicotine evokes.

1565
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,210
And then it's not really
about the dopamine

1566
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,030
that the nicotine evokes directly per se,

1567
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,950
but also about all the
positive effects that

1568
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,530
that increased dopamine results in.

1569
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,650
So we can easily circle back
to the negative effects of

1570
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,230
smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,

1571
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:43,560
and say the endothelial
cells are disrupted.

1572
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,110
The endothelial cells are
involved in delivery of blood

1573
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,430
and other nutrients to every tissue

1574
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,060
of the body and smoking
vaping, dipping, and snuffing

1575
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,580
contain carcinogens, which
are cancer promoting.

1576
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,800
And because the epidemiological
studies are out there,

1577
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,950
we can actually arrive at some
very clear numbers as to how

1578
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:03,840
much life one will lose
from ingesting nicotine

1579
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,210
by way of those four delivery devices,

1580
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,420
or I should say any one of
those four delivery devices.

1581
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,430
Although I should also mention
that many people who are

1582
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,320
vaping are also smoking cigarettes

1583
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,760
is becoming increasingly common.

1584
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,860
A lot of people are using
vaping in one context

1585
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,030
and cigarettes in another,

1586
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,100
dipping in one context, vaping in another.

1587
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,190
But even for those that
only smoke or only vape

1588
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,470
or only dip or only snuff,

1589
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:30,060
the negative effects are
dramatic and calculable.

1590
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,010
So it is thought that for every pack

1591
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,560
of cigarettes consumed per day,

1592
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,080
so you could average that
out if you're a two a day

1593
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,440
cigarette smoker or a pack
a day cigarette smoker,

1594
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,520
two pack a day.

1595
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,793
For every pack of
cigarettes smoked per day,

1596
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,750
we can reliably estimate a 14
year reduction in lifespan.

1597
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:55,170
So cigarettes are literally
peeling years off your life.

1598
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:58,080
Now because of the way that the
brain works and the way that

1599
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:02,400
human beings anticipate the
future and can be grounded both

1600
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,950
in the present and the future
or the present and the past,

1601
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,210
that's just how the mind works, right?

1602
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,560
That's why we can think about the future,

1603
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,530
but also realize where we
are in time and space today.

1604
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,840
Because of that, many
people will say, well,

1605
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,817
I enjoy cigarettes or I enjoy vaping.

1606
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,590
And so at least while I'm
here, I'm enjoying it.

1607
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:18,540
And that's because the dopamine system

1608
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,770
is not very good at
understanding opportunity costs.

1609
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:25,530
That is what we would be
doing in those 14 years

1610
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,450
and what we would be
enjoying and the enrichment

1611
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:30,720
that we would get if we were
to live into those 14 years.

1612
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,790
So at some level the smoker or vaper

1613
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,790
is being rational when they
say, yeah, but I enjoy this.

1614
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,950
And so the years lost,

1615
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,380
I can't really register that
because it's hard to register

1616
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,080
what you don't have and
what you've never had.

1617
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,610
On the other hand,

1618
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,640
we can also point to the
statistic that there is

1619
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,270
this 50 fold increase in
mouth cancers from dipping.

1620
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,430
And there are nasal cancers as well

1621
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:58,050
that are greatly increased
by snuffing and from smoking,

1622
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:02,040
and now we know based on
data from vaping that the

1623
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,580
endothelial cell damage
and the direct effects

1624
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,380
of damage to the lungs from tars,

1625
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,760
and even if people are vaping,

1626
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,970
which tends to have lower
tars than do cigarettes,

1627
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,650
even for people that are vaping,

1628
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,130
greatly increased probability of stroke,

1629
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,963
of peripheral vascular disease.

1630
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:22,051
So this is peripheral
pain because remember,

1631
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:22,980
blood is delivering, not just blood,

1632
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,110
but other nutrients and
it's clearing things

1633
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:26,340
out from tissues.

1634
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,460
So there's an accumulation of
literally toxins and debris

1635
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,710
that cells generate all
the time, which is healthy,

1636
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:34,140
but then the normally is cleared away

1637
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,340
by the endothelial cells

1638
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,160
and by other cell types
of the immune system,

1639
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,220
that's all increased in people that engage

1640
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,743
in these nicotine
delivery device behaviors.

1641
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:47,130
Rates of heart attack, rates of stroke,

1642
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,950
rates of cognitive
decline are all increased.

1643
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,060
Now you might say cognitive decline,

1644
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,720
I thought that nicotine increases
the likelihood that we can

1645
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,510
maintain healthy neural
function and cognitive capacity.

1646
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,313
It might even increase cognitive capacity

1647
01:05:59,313 --> 01:06:01,920
in a potent way in the short
term, and indeed it does.

1648
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,390
However,

1649
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:06,210
cigarette smoking and vaping are now known

1650
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:10,140
to dramatically decrease
cognitive function

1651
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,360
because one of the key
things about the brain

1652
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,090
is that it is the most
metabolically demanding organ,

1653
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:16,680
which means it consumes a lot of glucose.

1654
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,840
Or even if you're
ketogenic, you need ketones,

1655
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,150
you need nutrients getting
to the neurons in other cell

1656
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,800
types of the brain and nervous system

1657
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,570
in order for it to function properly.

1658
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,480
And when you disrupt a vasculature
through this endothelial

1659
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,240
cell dysfunction, you get
things like interstitial,

1660
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,460
which just means in the
spaces between dysfunction.

1661
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,170
So it's not just beating up

1662
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,610
the endothelial cells themselves,

1663
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:38,160
but the spaces between the
cells is being disrupted.

1664
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,930
There's a lot of debris
that accumulates there.

1665
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,550
And as a consequence,

1666
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:44,400
the brain just simply
will not function as well.

1667
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,320
So you start getting
short term memory lapses,

1668
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,820
you start getting working memory lapses,

1669
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,320
working memory is the sort of memory

1670
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,560
if someone tells you their
seven digit phone number,

1671
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,480
typically nowadays people
just share their info,

1672
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,280
but seven digit phone number or a sequence

1673
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,330
of numbers or an address

1674
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,740
and your inability to remember that.

1675
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,570
So you're walking back to the
kitchen sink and you can't

1676
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,490
remember what you were trying to remember

1677
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:04,560
just a short moment ago,
that's working memory.

1678
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,410
Working memory suffers, long term memory,

1679
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,530
projective or intergrade
memories into the future.

1680
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,590
How can you remember things in the future

1681
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,460
that haven't occurred yet?

1682
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,660
Well this is more of a memory
for future plans or ideas

1683
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,730
and planning for things that are to come.

1684
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,280
So what we can very reliably
say is that currently

1685
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,800
more than 1 billion, billion,

1686
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,250
more than 1 billion people consume tobacco

1687
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,990
in order to get their nicotine

1688
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:33,180
because that's really
the reinforcing element

1689
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,113
within tobacco,

1690
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,830
more than 1 billion people
consume tobacco in the form

1691
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,040
of cigarettes every day.

1692
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,750
A growing number of people,

1693
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,950
more than half a billion people
now are starting to vape.

1694
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:50,550
The estimates range from
200 million to 500 million.

1695
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,290
And there's a lot of
debate about this because

1696
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,960
a lot of people are
hybrid smokers and vapers,

1697
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,030
meaning they do one or both

1698
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,560
depending on time of day and location,

1699
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,910
as I mentioned before,

1700
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:04,170
but now you start to see how
you can get to the number

1701
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,540
that billions of people
are consuming tobacco.

1702
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,280
Because of course you
also have your people

1703
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,410
that are dipping and your
people that are snuffing.

1704
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:11,340
And as I mentioned before,

1705
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,860
you have people that
are engaging in multiple

1706
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,570
of these behaviors.

1707
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,600
So billions of people on planet Earth,

1708
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,529
anywhere from one eighth to
a quarter of human beings,

1709
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:23,999
incredible right?

1710
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,620
Anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of

1711
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,859
human beings are consuming
tobacco in one form or another

1712
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:32,789
in order to get their
nicotine one way or another.

1713
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,410
And as a consequence,

1714
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,068
are peeling years off their life,

1715
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:39,330
dramatically increasing
the probability of cancer,

1716
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:41,609
stroke, heart attack,

1717
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:45,389
peripheral neuropathies,
brain dysfunction,

1718
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:48,180
meaning cognitive dysfunction,
memory impairment,

1719
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,890
sexual dysfunction.

1720
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:51,069
There are a number of studies

1721
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:52,710
that have looked at increases in cortisol.

1722
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:55,710
And while minor, those increases do exist.

1723
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,810
Decreases in growth
hormone, and while minor,

1724
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:00,330
those decreases exist,

1725
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:05,069
but even setting aside the
negative impact on endocrine,

1726
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:06,809
on hormone factors,

1727
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,233
it's very, very clear
that smoking, vaping,

1728
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,639
dipping, and snuffing are
among the worst things

1729
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,500
that we can do for our health.

1730
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,770
They are among the leading
causes of preventable death

1731
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:21,903
and debilitating life conditions,

1732
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:25,140
which may lead you to the question as

1733
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:29,040
to why in the world would people do this?

1734
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,029
Well it turns out most
of them don't want to.

1735
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:35,469
In the best surveys that one can find of

1736
01:09:36,665 --> 01:09:37,590
if you could quit smoking,

1737
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,990
if you could quit vaping, would you,

1738
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:43,260
what you find is that at
least for cigarette smokers,

1739
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,580
70% want to quit.

1740
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,229
They would love to quit.

1741
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:51,989
And yet they find that to
be exceedingly difficult.

1742
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:54,720
And the reason they find it
to be exceedingly difficult is

1743
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,640
because of all the brain neurochemistry

1744
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,570
that we talked about before.

1745
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,480
The reason I spent close
to 20 minutes talking about

1746
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,010
dopamine and the mesolimbic pathway,

1747
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:06,570
acetylcholine and nucleus
basalis, and epinephrine,

1748
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,880
and the relaxation of muscles
in the periphery and the

1749
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,420
increase in readiness
in the body and brain is

1750
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,880
that all of those combine
to make nicotine one

1751
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,670
of the most powerful and
potent cognitive enhancers

1752
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:19,830
and to some extent physical enhancer,

1753
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,570
although, as I mentioned before,

1754
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:25,590
the total number of physical
exercise or physical

1755
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:30,030
sport promoting effects of
nicotine is very, very small,

1756
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:31,770
if not zero.

1757
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,920
There are certain conditions
under which one might imagine

1758
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,210
using nicotine specifically
for cognitive enhancement where

1759
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:42,510
performance of complex motor
skills would sort of outweigh

1760
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,090
the negative effects on
the neuromuscular system,

1761
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,760
our ability to generate
coordinated movements.

1762
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,100
There was actually an excellent
study looking at the effects

1763
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,620
of nicotine, not by smoking delivery,

1764
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:56,460
but by different delivery
mechanism in which they looked at

1765
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,490
performance of hitters in baseball.

1766
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,230
The experiment was kind
of an interesting one,

1767
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,390
even though these were fairly
skilled baseball players,

1768
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,880
what they had them do
was hit a ball off a tee,

1769
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,670
as I recall growing up and I admittedly

1770
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:09,690
I didn't play much baseball,

1771
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,670
but you start off on tee-ball and then

1772
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:13,320
you would go, I think it
was to pitching machine.

1773
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,017
Then they would use actual
pitchers who throw the ball.

1774
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:17,490
But in this case it was a couple

1775
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:19,230
of different baseball related tasks.

1776
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,810
They'd have people hit the ball off a tee,

1777
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,550
but they had to direct that hit

1778
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,830
toward a ball atop another tee.

1779
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:27,660
So it's fairly precise targeting that's

1780
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,060
required in order to knock
that ball off the other tee.

1781
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,700
So this is an activity that
involves not just motor output,

1782
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,470
but coordinated motor output,

1783
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,720
and not just coordinated motor output,

1784
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,360
but directed, coordinated output

1785
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,540
that requires some, as we
would say, top down processing.

1786
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,850
This isn't the kind of thing
that can be done reflexively.

1787
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:47,340
This is the kind of thing
where the forebrain,

1788
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,350
the prefrontal cortex in
particular has to be heavily

1789
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,690
involved in order to
suppress certain actions

1790
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:53,250
and then create other actions.

1791
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,530
So the basic takeaway of
the study is that nicotine

1792
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:58,020
delivered by way of nicotine gum,

1793
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,950
not by smoking, dipping,
or snuffing was able

1794
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,320
to increase cognitive
performance and motor output.

1795
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,180
So a rare circumstance where
a specific set of demands that

1796
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:12,900
involved both cognitive
engagement and physical engagement

1797
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,600
showed a slight but
significant improvement.

1798
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,670
But again, in most cases,

1799
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:21,300
nicotine is just simply not
going to improve physical output

1800
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,960
if it's delivered through
a smoked cigarette,

1801
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,810
through vaping, through
dipping, or through snuffing.

1802
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,780
So if all these behaviors
are terrible for essentially

1803
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,700
every aspect of our
health, frankly, I mean,

1804
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,533
when you look at the literature,

1805
01:12:33,533 --> 01:12:35,700
it's terrible for pregnant
women, it's terrible for kids,

1806
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,380
it's terrible for older people,

1807
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,910
it's terrible for younger people.

1808
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,960
You really cannot find a scenario
in which smoking, vaping,

1809
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,940
dipping, or snuffing are good for us.

1810
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,390
And yet people like the effects
on the brain and they feel

1811
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:50,970
quite addicted to them, even
if they say they're not,

1812
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:54,390
most of those people would
be unwilling to give up their

1813
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,140
practice of nicotine delivery
for more than a few hours.

1814
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,514
In fact,

1815
01:12:59,514 --> 01:13:00,690
if you look at the effects of
withdrawal and we are going

1816
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,423
to talk about what withdrawal
of nicotine looks like,

1817
01:13:03,423 --> 01:13:07,590
what you find is that
as soon as four hours

1818
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,930
after the last ingestion of nicotine

1819
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:13,470
by way of cigarette or vaping
or dipping or snuffing,

1820
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,990
what people start to experience

1821
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,270
is some agitation, craving
for nicotine, of course.

1822
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:20,850
And while craving is
kind of a vague concept,

1823
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:23,400
it's actually a very specific
biological mechanism.

1824
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,880
It's the drop in dopamine
that's starting to occur

1825
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,030
so much so that there's a drop
in dopamine below baseline.

1826
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:32,580
That is the increase in
dopamine that would normally

1827
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,670
be experienced from
smoking, vaping, dipping,

1828
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:38,100
or snuffing is now not happening.

1829
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,590
And in fact, the levels of
dopamine are dropping below

1830
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,150
where they would've been even

1831
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,550
without performing that behavior.

1832
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,800
So that's what craving is.

1833
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,520
And withdrawal is an increased
sense of that craving as well

1834
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,030
as a lot of negative stuff
like stomach aches or nausea

1835
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:57,000
or irritability, and often
collections of all of those.

1836
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,920
So because these nicotine
delivery approaches

1837
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,140
are so terrible for our health,

1838
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:05,070
and also because as many as 70% of people

1839
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,050
who smoke would like to quit,

1840
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,270
but either feel they can't
because they've tried

1841
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:13,230
and failed repeatedly often,
or because it's just too scary,

1842
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,510
meaning the reinforcing
properties are too strong and

1843
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:18,300
therefore they can't
imagine living without them

1844
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,000
or the withdrawal effects are too strong

1845
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,760
and they can't imagine living with those.

1846
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,733
Well then is there hope
for quitting smoking,

1847
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:29,340
vaping, snuffing, or dipping?

1848
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,920
And the short answer, fortunately is yes,

1849
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,360
there are excellent ways to do that.

1850
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,930
And some of them are
single event treatments.

1851
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,540
And we're going to talk
about those shortly,

1852
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,380
but before we do that,

1853
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,480
I want to highlight one very brief point,

1854
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,620
which is that nicotine is
not the cause of cancer.

1855
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,720
Nicotine is not the carcinogen,

1856
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,430
it's the other things
in tobacco or associated

1857
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:57,390
with the nicotine delivery
device that are causing cancer.

1858
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:00,570
And I should mention the
other negative impacts

1859
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:01,654
on our health in particular

1860
01:15:01,654 --> 01:15:06,090
by way of disrupted endothelial
blood vessel function.

1861
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:07,950
Now that leads us to this issue of vaping,

1862
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:09,630
because as many of you know,

1863
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,000
and probably are thinking
as I've been delivering

1864
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,933
this information, people
don't vape tobacco.

1865
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:19,980
The way that vaping pens
are designed is that

1866
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,800
it includes some liquid, it involves heat,

1867
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,650
and it does not involve
the burning off of tobacco.

1868
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:29,700
In fact, there's a constant
updating of the engineering

1869
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,020
of these vape pens so that
they can be very low heat.

1870
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:37,620
In some cases they use even
non heating approaches to

1871
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,690
vaporize the nicotine and allow it

1872
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:42,630
to enter the bloodstream very quickly.

1873
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:47,630
I must say in a lot of ways,
vaping resembles crack cocaine.

1874
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,180
The reason why vaping and
crack cocaine are so similar

1875
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:55,170
is the speed of entry of
nicotine into the bloodstream.

1876
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:57,420
This isn't an episode about cocaine,

1877
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,180
but I just want to very briefly
touch on some of the delivery

1878
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,580
routes for cocaine because they parallel

1879
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,160
a lot of the delivery routes for nicotine.

1880
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,900
And we can learn a lot about

1881
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,630
drug pharmacokinetics and dopamine

1882
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:13,263
if we look at the parallels
between cocaine and nicotine.

1883
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:18,360
I'll preface this by saying
cocaine is a terrible drug.

1884
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,180
It is actually a schedule two
drug in the United States,

1885
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,770
which means that it has a very,

1886
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:26,010
very limited yet still
present medical application,

1887
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:29,700
mainly as an anesthetic
in certain laboratory

1888
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,560
and hospital conditions.

1889
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,940
But aside from that,

1890
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:35,490
it's very clear that cocaine
is one of the most debilitating

1891
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,860
drugs that humans can
use because of the way

1892
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,630
that it impacts the dopamine system.

1893
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:43,170
And it basically creates a
loop whereby the only thing

1894
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:46,890
that can really trigger
dopamine release is cocaine.

1895
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:48,480
And as I've said before,

1896
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,210
the way that I define
addiction is it's a progressive

1897
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:53,370
narrowing of the things
that bring people pleasure.

1898
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:55,440
Cocaine certainly falls into the category

1899
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,770
of addictive drugs,
strongly addictive drugs.

1900
01:16:58,770 --> 01:16:59,603
And in fact,

1901
01:16:59,603 --> 01:17:01,560
it has the additionally pernicious feature

1902
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,890
that after using cocaine
for some period of time,

1903
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:07,500
the amount of dopamine that's
released becomes progressively

1904
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,440
lower and lower and lower so
that people can never get back

1905
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,890
to a state in which dopamine
release is ever as great

1906
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,630
as it was the first time they did cocaine

1907
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:17,345
or prior to doing cocaine.

1908
01:17:17,345 --> 01:17:22,345
Now with a long period of
no cocaine use whatsoever

1909
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,860
and protecting the dopamine system

1910
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,420
in a number of different ways,

1911
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:30,420
people can often, not always but often

1912
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,730
recover their dopamine system,

1913
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:34,803
if not completely then near completely.

1914
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:39,030
So by all means, if you have
a problem with cocaine, quit,

1915
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,130
find a way to quit, get treatment,

1916
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,810
get over that one way or another.

1917
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:44,940
We have an episode with an expert guest,

1918
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,350
Dr. Anna Lembke,

1919
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,910
who's a physician and the chief

1920
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,590
of the Stanford School of Medicine

1921
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:51,810
dual diagnosis addiction clinic,

1922
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,810
a world expert in dopamine
and addictive substances

1923
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,220
and addictions of all kinds.

1924
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,724
You can find that episode
at hubermanlab.com.

1925
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:01,320
It's filled with information
about how to get over different

1926
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,150
types of addictions,
including cocaine addiction.

1927
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,370
Also check out her absolutely phenomenal

1928
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,260
and indeed important
book "Dopamine Nation",

1929
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,720
which touches on some of this as well.

1930
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,000
And in the show note
captions for the episode

1931
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,160
where Dr. Lembke was my guest,

1932
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,590
you can also find some additional
resources related to that.

1933
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:19,350
So cocaine is terrible. That
needs to be acknowledged.

1934
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:21,810
It should be avoided and you
should find a way to quit it

1935
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:23,283
if you are currently using.

1936
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:25,770
With that said,

1937
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:29,040
the delivery mechanism for
cocaine strongly parallels

1938
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,930
the delivery mechanisms for nicotine.

1939
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,640
That is people will snort cocaine,

1940
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,740
which is a lot like snuffing or dipping.

1941
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,300
That is when people snort cocaine,

1942
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,820
they're bringing cocaine into
proximity or into contact,

1943
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:41,880
really with the mucosal
lining of the nasal passages,

1944
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,670
which then allows the
psychoactive substances

1945
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:47,010
to permeate into the bloodstream.

1946
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,140
Very seldom do people eat it,

1947
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,140
although that does
happen from time to time,

1948
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,110
people will inject it,
as so-called mainlining,

1949
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,720
which is a very rapid entry
into the bloodstream because

1950
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,730
it's direct application to the bloodstream

1951
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:00,753
by way of injection.

1952
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,423
And then there's crack cocaine,

1953
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:05,610
which is essentially like
a vaporizing of the cocaine

1954
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,710
from a so-called cocaine rock,

1955
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:12,690
that somewhat resembles
vaping of nicotine.

1956
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:15,870
So while the vape pen
involves a liquid that's sold,

1957
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,760
a cartridge that contains nicotine

1958
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,843
and often other flavors as
well, flavorings I should say,

1959
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:27,240
both crack cocaine and
vaping cause very rapid

1960
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,130
increases in the relative substances

1961
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:30,810
that are psychoactive,
in the case of cocaine,

1962
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:33,510
that would be cocaine and
the increase in dopamine

1963
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,550
in the brain and body I should mention.

1964
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:37,080
And in the case of vaping,

1965
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,730
there's a very rapid increase

1966
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,320
in blood concentrations of nicotine,

1967
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,380
much faster than occur
with cigarette smoking

1968
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,840
or other modes of nicotine delivery.

1969
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,800
So that speed of onset turns
out to be a critical parameter

1970
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,790
because the speed of onset
of nicotine is going to also

1971
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:56,000
determine the speed of release of dopamine

1972
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,230
in the nucleus accumbens
and ventral tegmental area,

1973
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:00,570
that mesolimbic reward pathway.

1974
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,220
And with the mesolimbic reward pathway,

1975
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,470
it's not just about the peak,

1976
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,250
meaning the maximal amount
of dopamine that's released,

1977
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,070
but it's the time course,
how steep the curve is,

1978
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:12,720
how quickly that dopamine increases

1979
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,240
that's going to determine how reinforcing,

1980
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,580
how habit forming and indeed how addictive

1981
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,083
a particular substance is.

1982
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,470
One of the major important
differences between vaping and

1983
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,420
cigarette smoking is that the onset

1984
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,660
of dopamine release from vaping is faster.

1985
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:31,230
And even a subtle increase
in the rate at which dopamine

1986
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:36,060
increases in the mesolimbic
reward pathway can make a given

1987
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:40,800
amount of nicotine much more
habit forming and addictive.

1988
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,830
Now this probably explains
the fact that many,

1989
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,120
many more people, in particular,

1990
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,370
young people age 25 and younger

1991
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,340
are vaping at phenomenal rates.

1992
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:52,830
People are starting to vape
in just about everywhere.

1993
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,780
You see this in restaurants,
you see it on the street,

1994
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,270
indeed you even see it in the classroom.

1995
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,360
This has actually become
sort of sport of sorts.

1996
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,040
Certainly not something I encourage.

1997
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,990
In fact, when I learned about this from

1998
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:06,750
a new college student is telling me

1999
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,270
that many college students are
actually bringing vape pens

2000
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,103
into the classroom.

2001
01:21:10,103 --> 01:21:11,880
I think this is also
happening in high schools

2002
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,860
and even junior high schools.

2003
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,560
This is a really concerning practice.

2004
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,810
And here I'm not trying to come across as

2005
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,100
the anti vaping crusader,

2006
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,560
but I must say given the negative effects

2007
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,300
on one's health in the long term,

2008
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,080
but also given these exceedingly
powerful reward properties

2009
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,810
of nicotine entering
the bloodstream quickly,

2010
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:33,360
and dopamine being released very quickly

2011
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,700
from the mesolimbic reward pathway,

2012
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,340
what we're seeing out
there makes total sense.

2013
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,030
Young people's brains are
essentially getting wired

2014
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,240
to the expectation that dopamine
is going to be increased

2015
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:48,240
dramatically and quickly
under their control,

2016
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,160
except it's under their control

2017
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,500
only in a very narrow
set of circumstances.

2018
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,360
Recall the definition of addiction,

2019
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,370
a progressive narrowing of the things

2020
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,203
that bring you pleasure.

2021
01:21:57,203 --> 01:22:01,800
We can change that statement
to also say a progressive

2022
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,130
narrowing and specific kinetics,

2023
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:08,010
that is specific time course of the things

2024
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:09,210
that bring you pleasure.

2025
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:10,950
Now that's a bit of a
nerdier statement than

2026
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:12,090
a progressive narrowing of the things

2027
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:12,923
that bring you pleasure.

2028
01:22:12,923 --> 01:22:15,570
But what we are going to
see in the next few years,

2029
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:19,020
I believe is an entire
generation of young people

2030
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:22,770
for which a very large percentage
of them are going to be

2031
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,560
seeking out a pattern or feeling

2032
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,700
because to the person taking it,

2033
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,230
they're not looking at
their dopamine levels

2034
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:29,310
rising in their blood.

2035
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:31,220
They're experiencing this
as an increase in focus,

2036
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,270
an increase in alertness,

2037
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:36,300
an increase in mood and
wellbeing that is very rapid,

2038
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,590
very dramatic,

2039
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:41,970
and that simply cannot be
recreated by any other substance.

2040
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,580
And that's a very concerning scenario,

2041
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,640
concerning because that
mesolimbic reward pathway

2042
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,470
is the only pathway,

2043
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:53,190
the only pathway by which
you can achieve the rewarding

2044
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:55,560
properties of any kind of endeavor,

2045
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,930
not just vaping of course.

2046
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,930
It is the way in which people
achieve satisfaction from

2047
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:04,050
reaching a relationship
goal or an athletic goal

2048
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,850
or an educational goal,

2049
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,220
any kind of goal or sense of satisfaction.

2050
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,640
And so it comes as no surprise
that vaping is strongly

2051
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,460
associated with increased
levels of depression,

2052
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,590
especially when vaping use drops off.

2053
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:17,490
Why would that be?

2054
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,290
If people are getting
so much more dopamine

2055
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:20,700
so much more quickly from vaping,

2056
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,023
shouldn't they be feeling better?

2057
01:23:22,023 --> 01:23:25,470
That brings us back to the
critical, and I should say,

2058
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:28,110
defining feature of the
dopamine reward pathway

2059
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,910
for motivation and wellbeing,

2060
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:33,120
which is that initially a
given substance will cause,

2061
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,940
let's say an eight out of
10, again, arbitrary units,

2062
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:39,150
but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine.

2063
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,560
But with repeated use,

2064
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,530
what ends up happening
is that even at similar

2065
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,330
or higher levels of ingestion,

2066
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,400
so not just one inhalation a minute,

2067
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,700
but maybe two inhalations a minute

2068
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,570
or an inhalation every 30 seconds.

2069
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:54,180
Now it's level four out of 10 activation

2070
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,800
of dopamine and then three and then two.

2071
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,080
And eventually it drops below baseline.

2072
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,370
Now the whole system can be recovered

2073
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:02,790
by abstinence from nicotine consumption,

2074
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:05,010
but the dopamine system
is applied to everything,

2075
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:07,620
all sense of wellbeing,
all sense of motivation.

2076
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:10,350
So during the period in
which one is abstaining

2077
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,843
from nicotine and vaping in particular,

2078
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,120
people do not feel good.

2079
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,160
They feel miserable. That's
why it's called withdrawal.

2080
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,610
It's associated with a
bunch of psychological and

2081
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:24,060
physiological symptoms that all lead back

2082
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:27,600
to trying to get to the same
levels of dopamine release

2083
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,940
in the same patterns that were experienced

2084
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,160
when one initially started vaping.

2085
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,650
So I'm not trying to paint a
dark picture here, but frankly,

2086
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:36,630
the picture is very dark.

2087
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:40,350
I'm very concerned about a
practice of ingesting something

2088
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:43,350
that powerfully modulates the
dopamine system with the sorts

2089
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,990
of kinetics that one sees from
ingestion of crack cocaine

2090
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,300
in young people that has all
these other negative health

2091
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,300
effects that in the short term
is very powerfully rewarding,

2092
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,490
increased focus, wellbeing, et cetera,

2093
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:57,120
but that over a very brief
period of time leads to a state

2094
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,920
in which the entire dopamine
reward system is impaired and

2095
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,840
can become permanently impaired

2096
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,870
unless one intervenes in
a very deliberate way.

2097
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:09,990
So people are directly
controlling the rate of dopamine

2098
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,960
and the frequency of dopamine
release by the duration

2099
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,800
and frequency of inhalations
off the vape pen.

2100
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,340
And that's an incredible thing
because what it does is it

2101
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,430
sets up the mesolimbic reward
pathway for an expectation

2102
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:26,610
that dopamine will be
delivered on that schedule.

2103
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,290
So that's one of the things

2104
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:32,569
that makes vaping in
particular so hard to quit.

2105
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:34,860
Vaping is actually harder to quit

2106
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,335
than cigarette smoking for most people.

2107
01:25:37,335 --> 01:25:39,570
Now does that mean that cigarette smoking

2108
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,940
is fairly easy to quit for most people?

2109
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,290
No.

2110
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:45,360
70% of people who smoke cigarettes report

2111
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,900
that they would like to quit
if they thought they could.

2112
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,150
The success rate of quitting smoking

2113
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,160
when people try to go just cold turkey,

2114
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,930
just quit with no assistance whatsoever.

2115
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:56,250
They might tell their family and friends,

2116
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,700
hey, I'm quitting, that's it,

2117
01:25:58,602 --> 01:26:01,410
is exceedingly low, it's 5%.

2118
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:04,860
So 5% of the people that say, that's it,

2119
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,030
I'm not smoking again.

2120
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:08,970
Despite cancer diagnosis,
I'm not smoking again.

2121
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:10,710
Despite the fear of the
negative health effects,

2122
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:12,690
I'm not going to ever smoke again.

2123
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:16,898
Despite the financial
cost, the health cost.

2124
01:26:16,898 --> 01:26:18,793
I could list off a huge
number of things that it does

2125
01:26:18,793 --> 01:26:19,626
that are negative,

2126
01:26:19,626 --> 01:26:21,840
but you already know these
or you've heard them,

2127
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,770
it makes your skin worse, as
I mentioned it lowers libido,

2128
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:26,880
it disrupts hormones,

2129
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,630
it disrupts vascular
function, brain function.

2130
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:31,830
It does all these terrible things.

2131
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:34,290
And yet most people who
try and quit simply can't.

2132
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,990
And of the 5% that succeed in quitting,

2133
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:40,590
a full 65% of them relapse within a year.

2134
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:42,900
So that's a very depressing picture,

2135
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,787
but it's not to say
that people cannot quit.

2136
01:26:44,787 --> 01:26:45,990
And in fact, they can.

2137
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:47,010
There are a couple of methods

2138
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:49,440
that have been shown to help people quit.

2139
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:53,070
Some are behavioral and
some are pharmacologic.

2140
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,710
I just want to touch on the
behavioral ones first because it

2141
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,860
turns out that there's
a quite powerful method

2142
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:02,790
for quitting nicotine ingestion
by way of cigarette smoking,

2143
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,770
which also carries over to vaping.

2144
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:07,530
This is beautiful work that's
been done by my colleague,

2145
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:08,760
in fact, close collaborator,

2146
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,260
although I was not
involved in the research

2147
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,210
that I'm about to describe at Stanford.

2148
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,880
And his name is Dr. David Spiegel.

2149
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,590
He is our associate chair of psychiatry.

2150
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:18,570
He's been a guest on the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

2151
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,160
and he is a world expert,

2152
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,840
if not the world expert

2153
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,180
in the clinical applications of hypnosis.

2154
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,290
Now when I say hypnosis,

2155
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:27,000
a lot of people think stage hypnosis,

2156
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,900
which is the hypnotist

2157
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,730
trying to get people to do certain things

2158
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:30,960
and say certain things,

2159
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,940
not necessarily against their will

2160
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,170
because they actually have to agree.

2161
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,030
But the hypnotist is dictating

2162
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:38,880
what the person thinks, says, and does.

2163
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,910
Clinical hypnosis is
vastly different from that.

2164
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:44,460
Clinical hypnosis is where the person,

2165
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,330
the patient actually directs
their own brain changes toward

2166
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:51,150
a specific emotional or behavioral goal.

2167
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:55,380
Work from Dr. David Spiegel's
laboratory done in 1993,

2168
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,030
but that now has been repeated many,

2169
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:59,160
many times that has carried
over into some more modern

2170
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,950
studies and I will provide
links to those studies

2171
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:04,770
in the show note captions
so that you can access them.

2172
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:06,240
Those studies have shown that

2173
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,943
using a specific form of hypnosis,

2174
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,630
people can achieve complete

2175
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:15,720
and total cessation of cigarette smoking.

2176
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,910
And there's no reason to
believe this doesn't also carry

2177
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:21,780
over to vaping through one
single hypnosis session.

2178
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:25,230
And the success rates are
incredibly high when one considers

2179
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:28,290
that normally it would be
only a 5% success rate.

2180
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:31,170
The success rate with this
particular hypnosis developed

2181
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:32,310
at Stanford School of Medicine

2182
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:35,580
by Dr. David Spiegel is 23%

2183
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:38,010
of people who do this hypnosis one time

2184
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:39,630
succeed in quitting smoking.

2185
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:41,820
Now in the old days,

2186
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,620
which actually wasn't that long ago,

2187
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,720
before the advent of smartphones

2188
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,790
and before the internet took off

2189
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,383
to the extent that it has now,

2190
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:53,633
this was done by having
someone come into the clinic

2191
01:28:53,633 --> 01:28:54,466
and Dr. Spiegel himself

2192
01:28:54,466 --> 01:28:56,130
or one of his colleagues
would take somebody

2193
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,180
through the hypnosis.

2194
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,600
Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis.

2195
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,970
There's a wonderful app that was developed

2196
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,280
by Dr. David Spiegel and others.

2197
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,860
It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.

2198
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,090
I've talked about this app a few times

2199
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,050
on the podcast before,

2200
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,480
because there are hypnosis
scripts within the app for

2201
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,940
enhancing sleep, for improving
ability of fall asleep

2202
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,190
if you wake up in the middle
of the night, for focus,

2203
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:20,550
and a number of other behavioral
and emotional changes.

2204
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:23,040
There's also a function in the Reveri app

2205
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,690
for smoking cessation,

2206
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:28,920
which exactly parallels
the sort of in laboratory

2207
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,980
and in clinic approaches
that Dr. Spiegel would use

2208
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,470
were you to show up at his
clinic or his laboratory.

2209
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,940
And since that's not possible

2210
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,890
for the large number of people out there,

2211
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,740
if you or somebody else
is trying to quit smoking

2212
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:45,180
or vaping or dipping or
snuffing for that matter,

2213
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,880
I strongly encourage you to
check out the Reveri app.

2214
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,820
You can find it easily
by going to reveri.com.

2215
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:53,508
It's available in various formats.

2216
01:29:53,508 --> 01:29:54,341
Some of it is available free,

2217
01:29:54,341 --> 01:29:55,620
some of it is behind a paywall,

2218
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,930
but given the tremendously negative impact

2219
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:00,453
of smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,

2220
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:05,790
the hypnosis for smoking
cessation that Reveri has seems

2221
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:09,630
at least to me as a very
powerful and worthwhile resource.

2222
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,620
So please check that out

2223
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:13,890
if you're somebody who's trying
to quit ingesting nicotine

2224
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:16,620
by any of the four methods
that I just described.

2225
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,453
Now of course,

2226
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,480
there are other methods
that people have used to

2227
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,280
successfully quit smoking or vaping

2228
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,010
or other forms of nicotine delivery.

2229
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:25,410
And there's actually an
excellent review on this topic.

2230
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,780
So before diving into a few
of the specifics about some of

2231
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:31,260
the pharmacology of using nicotine itself

2232
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,080
to quit smoking or nicotine
itself to quit vaping,

2233
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,690
or the use of various things, even SSRIs,

2234
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:40,410
antidepressants to quit smoking or vaping.

2235
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,510
I just want to point you to a
review article that if you'd

2236
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,000
like to get a complete
survey of all the options

2237
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,730
that are available, there's
an excellent review on this.

2238
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:49,857
It was published just a
couple of years ago in 2020.

2239
01:30:49,857 --> 01:30:51,157
And the title of the article is

2240
01:30:51,157 --> 01:30:53,910
"Pharmacologic Approach
to Smoking Cessation:

2241
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,580
An Updated Review for
Daily Clinical Practice".

2242
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,880
And even though this is mainly
focused on smoking cessation,

2243
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,430
it carries over quite nicely to vaping.

2244
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:04,290
And it details a number of statistics,

2245
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,700
the fact that every year,

2246
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:07,500
700,000 or more people die

2247
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,970
because of smoking related diseases.

2248
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:09,803
So there again you have

2249
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:13,380
the negative health effects
that younger people are smoking,

2250
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,970
that women are smoking more nowadays.

2251
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,410
And that even though you see less smoking,

2252
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:19,140
typically in the US and Canada,
and even in Northern Europe,

2253
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,450
some places, there are still
many many people are smoking

2254
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:24,840
who would like to quit,
but that 75% of people,

2255
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:27,030
at least according to this
review earlier, I said 70%,

2256
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:30,180
but estimates are as high as
75% of people who try to quit

2257
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,760
smoking relapse within the first week.

2258
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,290
The first week, they
just go right back to it.

2259
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,810
That's how powerfully
reinforcing the nicotine is.

2260
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,880
Remember, it's the nicotine
in the cigarette that's

2261
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,880
powerfully reinforcing, but
it's also the oral habit,

2262
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:45,360
the motor habit.

2263
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,830
There is this thing about density

2264
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,240
of sensory receptors in the lips.

2265
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,613
People like bringing things to their lips,

2266
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:56,480
food, cigarettes, other lips
in some cases, et cetera,

2267
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:59,010
there is a reinforcement
pathway related to that

2268
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:01,470
for sort of obvious adaptive reasons.

2269
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:05,490
And as a consequence,
there is a reinforcement,

2270
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,590
both from the behavior
and from the dopamine

2271
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:09,180
released from the nicotine itself.

2272
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,560
And as I mentioned earlier,

2273
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,720
from the positive reinforcement

2274
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,950
that comes from increased focus.

2275
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:15,300
So the money that you make through work

2276
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,680
or your attentional ability

2277
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,630
or the fact that you're alert
and people feel you present,

2278
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:21,900
all of that funnels back
into positive reinforcement,

2279
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,790
behavioral reinforcement,

2280
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:26,280
and then what we would call addiction.

2281
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:30,240
So this review covers all of
that and then steps beautifully

2282
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,840
through nicotine replacement
therapy and various compounds,

2283
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,760
several of which I'm
going to talk about now,

2284
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,430
which have been shown to increase
that number that we talked

2285
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:41,490
about earlier of only 5%
of people who try to quit

2286
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,430
with no other support
pharmacologic or hypnosis

2287
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:47,070
or otherwise just say that's it,
I'm not going to smoke again,

2288
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,690
or I'm not going to vape again,

2289
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:50,940
only 5% of people succeed in doing that.

2290
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,790
And even among those, many
end up relapsing later,

2291
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,890
there are a couple
pharmacologic approaches.

2292
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:57,930
One of the main ones that's
received a lot of attention in

2293
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:59,230
recent years is Bupropion,

2294
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,110
sometimes referred to by its
commercial name Wellbutrin.

2295
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:09,110
Now Bupropion is a compound
that increases the release of

2296
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:11,940
dopamine and to a lesser
extent epinephrine

2297
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,620
and some other neurochemicals as well.

2298
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,660
It's used for the treatment of depression

2299
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:17,730
and for smoking cessation.

2300
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:19,980
Now I want to point out
again, I'm not a psychiatrist,

2301
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:23,490
so I'm not telling you to take
Bupropion, AKA Wellbutrin,

2302
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:25,500
but I'm going to give you a little
bit of the contour of what's

2303
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,500
typically done in terms of
Bupropion administration

2304
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,410
to help people get relief
from some of the withdrawal

2305
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:33,930
symptoms of trying to
quit smoking or vaping

2306
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:36,570
or other forms of nicotine ingestion.

2307
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:41,010
Typically Bupropion is taken
in 300 milligram per day

2308
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:44,190
doses divided into two dosages
of 150 milligrams each,

2309
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:47,250
or sometimes there's a
slow release formula.

2310
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,950
The dosages will vary
from person to person.

2311
01:33:49,950 --> 01:33:51,980
I want to really emphasize that there

2312
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:54,690
is an increased seizure
risk with Bupropion.

2313
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,970
It only occurs in a small
fraction of the population,

2314
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,980
but nonetheless is a real concern

2315
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,420
for those members of the population.

2316
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,220
So for those of you with seizure risk,

2317
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,660
whether you know it or not,

2318
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:06,180
that's going to be a valid concern

2319
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,010
in terms of potential side effects.

2320
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:11,760
The other thing about Bupropion
is that it has to be used

2321
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,160
with caution in patients that
have liver disease or renal

2322
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,620
disease that can impact the amount

2323
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,720
that anyone can take meaning
sometimes people have to take

2324
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,790
a much lower dose if
they have renal disease

2325
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:22,230
or liver disease.

2326
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:23,940
And sometimes they can't take it at all.

2327
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:26,670
Sometimes if people are taking
benzodiazepines for whatever

2328
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,143
reason or other sedatives,

2329
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:32,169
there are contraindications
there, so Bupropion isn't a

2330
01:34:32,169 --> 01:34:34,380
kind of one size fits all or magic bullet

2331
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:36,420
for quitting smoking, nonetheless,

2332
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,070
for people that can take it safely,

2333
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:39,900
and again, this is a prescription drug,

2334
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,510
a board certified psychiatrist
or other physician is going

2335
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,640
to have to prescribe it for you
if it's appropriate for you.

2336
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:48,240
And it moves that number of
5% success rate to about what

2337
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:53,240
one sees with the clinical
hypnosis to about 20% of people

2338
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:56,790
will successfully overcome their nicotine,

2339
01:34:56,790 --> 01:35:00,300
or I should say their
smoking or vaping addiction.

2340
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,540
Now it's important to ask
why this would work, right?

2341
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:08,250
It's not as if Bupropion is
increasing nicotine per se.

2342
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,600
What it's doing is it's tapping

2343
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,330
on that mesolimbic reward
pathway, increasing dopamine,

2344
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:15,180
or at least allowing dopamine
levels to say substantially

2345
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:18,990
elevated enough that people
don't experience some of the

2346
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:21,420
drop in dopamine that leads
to the withdrawal symptoms,

2347
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,860
the lessening of mood, et cetera.

2348
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,660
And it's no coincidence that Bupropion

2349
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,430
is also an antidepressant.

2350
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,950
It's a common antidepressant
for people that experience

2351
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:31,290
negative side effects
with the so-called SSRIs,

2352
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:34,500
the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors that prevent

2353
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,510
them from taking those
things like lessen libido

2354
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,343
or appetite,

2355
01:35:37,343 --> 01:35:39,900
or in some cases increased
appetite or any number

2356
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,060
of other side effects
that some people, not all,

2357
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,830
but some people experience with SSRIs.

2358
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:45,270
They'll be prescribed Wellbutrin,

2359
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:48,180
Bupropion is the generic name.

2360
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:50,190
So Wellbutrin being the
commercial name again,

2361
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:54,510
Bupropion is what they'll be
prescribed instead with the

2362
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:57,600
caveats of seizure risk, renal disease,

2363
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,923
liver disease, et cetera.

2364
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,460
The outcomes with Wellbutrin
for smoking cessation

2365
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:04,020
are pretty good if you
think about an increase

2366
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:07,110
from 5% to 20%, that's pretty dramatic.

2367
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:10,380
And yet I also want to refer
back to the incredible success

2368
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:12,120
of the clinical hypnosis approach.

2369
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,730
Again, you can find that at reveri.com,

2370
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:19,163
the clinical hypnosis approach
has a success rate of 23%.

2371
01:36:20,126 --> 01:36:20,959
So it's very closely aligned with,

2372
01:36:20,959 --> 01:36:24,420
if not exceeding the
success rate with Bupropion.

2373
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,580
Of course there are other
pharmacologic approaches

2374
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,610
to quitting smoking or vaping.

2375
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:33,060
All of them generally circle
back to increasing dopamine

2376
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,250
and/or norepinephrine in order to offset

2377
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:38,460
some of the withdrawal
symptoms of smoking cessation

2378
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,720
or vaping cessation.

2379
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,900
A very common approach for
people to try and quit smoking or

2380
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:47,900
vaping is to use nicotine
itself to try and prevent people

2381
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:52,290
from seeking nicotine through
a cigarette or a vape pen.

2382
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:55,440
What I mean by that is people
using a nicotine patch or

2383
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,070
nicotine gum or other
nicotine delivery device

2384
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:02,010
that is not cigarettes and not vaping

2385
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:05,250
in order to maintain levels of nicotine

2386
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,110
in their bloodstream,

2387
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:09,510
which of course means maintain
levels of nicotine in their

2388
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:12,180
brain and body to the same extent

2389
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,030
that they would if they
were smoking or vaping,

2390
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:18,570
maybe even gradually taking
down the total amount of

2391
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:21,630
nicotine in their brain
and body by reducing

2392
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:24,960
the number or size of nicotine gum pieces

2393
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,430
that they ingest each day,

2394
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:29,040
or keeping the patch on for
a shorter amount of time

2395
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,770
or getting a lower dose patch
that releases less nicotine

2396
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:34,353
total or over time.

2397
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,230
All of those approaches have been shown

2398
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:39,120
to be reasonably successful,

2399
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,230
I'll get to the numbers in a few minutes,

2400
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:43,350
but reasonably successful
in allowing people

2401
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:46,750
to quit smoking or vaping.

2402
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,770
Again, most of the data
is on cigarette smoking

2403
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:52,230
because vaping is a
relatively new phenomenon.

2404
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:54,480
Although quite troublingly,

2405
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,810
it's a very rapidly increasing behavior,

2406
01:37:57,810 --> 01:37:59,340
especially in the young population.

2407
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,470
So that's why I'm kind of
lumping these two things together

2408
01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:06,210
because I think very soon we
are going to need an all out

2409
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:09,600
campaign for how to
counter vaping addiction.

2410
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,940
So what do we know about smoking cessation

2411
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,560
using nicotine itself?

2412
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,530
Is the patch best? Is nicotine gum best?

2413
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:19,680
Turns out that a combination of approaches

2414
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,660
is best, so somewhat surprising,

2415
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,490
but it was very clear from the
literature that I was able to

2416
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:27,390
find that using nicotine
patches for some period of time

2417
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:29,250
and then switching to a gum

2418
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:33,150
and then perhaps switching
to a nasal spray,

2419
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:34,980
that's going to be the most effective.

2420
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:38,130
Then the question is how long
to continue each of those

2421
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:39,600
and whether or not to overlap them.

2422
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,600
It seems as if doing one for
about a week and then switching

2423
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,330
to another for about a week and
then switching to another is

2424
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:47,820
one rationable and reasonable approach

2425
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:50,190
that many people have used successfully.

2426
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:51,090
Why would that be?

2427
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:53,880
It all has to do with the
different rates of absorption

2428
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,530
of nicotine into the bloodstream,

2429
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:57,150
and then the downstream consequences

2430
01:38:57,150 --> 01:39:00,480
of that on the dopamine,
acetylcholine, epinephrine,

2431
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,640
and other systems of the brain and body.

2432
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,970
And while there hasn't been
an extremely detailed study

2433
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:07,860
of the exact kinetics of

2434
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,260
how the nasal sprays versus
the transdermal patches

2435
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,090
versus the gums, et cetera, work,

2436
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:13,560
there's a logical structure to it

2437
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:14,880
that will immediately make sense to you.

2438
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,323
First of all,

2439
01:39:16,323 --> 01:39:18,930
the transdermal patches
provide a fairly steady state

2440
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:21,450
dopamine release across the day.

2441
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,790
And oftentimes people are
wearing them at night as well.

2442
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:26,850
This is relevant because if
people are ingesting nicotine

2443
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:29,313
by way of smoking and vaping,

2444
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,950
hopefully they're not waking
up in the middle of the night

2445
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:32,910
just to smoke or vape.

2446
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:34,200
Believe or not, some people do that,

2447
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,390
but of course, while people are asleep,

2448
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:38,550
they are not smoking or vaping.

2449
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:39,480
They always tell you don't fall asleep

2450
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,313
with a cigarette in your mouth,

2451
01:39:40,313 --> 01:39:42,330
you'll burn the whole house down,

2452
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:45,510
but exceedingly rare to have people

2453
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:47,040
are smoking in their sleep.

2454
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,100
So people wake up in the morning
and because the half life

2455
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,110
of nicotine from smoking
or vaping is very short,

2456
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,030
anywhere from one to two hours,

2457
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,980
they're essentially in a state
of withdrawal at the point

2458
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,030
where they wake up in the morning.

2459
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,900
How can I say that?

2460
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:01,320
Remember, withdrawal sets in
about four hours after the last

2461
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,210
ingestion of nicotine by cigarette

2462
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,100
or by inhalation from the vape pen.

2463
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,100
So people are waking up in
nicotine withdrawal and then

2464
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:10,950
immediately going into the
behavior of ingesting nicotine,

2465
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,620
or very soon after waking for most people.

2466
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,660
So nicotine patch is going to be

2467
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,910
very effective for a week or so, again,

2468
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:20,520
talk to your physician about
the best approach for this,

2469
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,940
but then switching to a nasal spray

2470
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:26,160
or switching to nicotine
gum for about a week,

2471
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,530
which is going to change the
kinetics of that nicotine

2472
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:31,590
absorption into the bloodstream
and change the release

2473
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:33,810
of dopamine and other
neurochemicals within the brain.

2474
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:37,230
That's going to keep the system
intentionally off balance

2475
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:40,890
so that it never comes to
expect one single pattern

2476
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:44,040
or amplitude of dopamine release.

2477
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:47,673
And that is a very powerful way for a,

2478
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:51,750
let's just call it a
quitting method to work.

2479
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,370
Because as I've always said,

2480
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:56,280
the most powerful schedule of dopamine

2481
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:59,190
is going to be this random
intermittent reward.

2482
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:00,900
This is what's used in the casinos

2483
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,100
in order to take your money.

2484
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,780
And generally they do, on average,

2485
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:06,360
they take your money more
than you take theirs,

2486
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,100
and they take more of it.

2487
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:09,660
Not just more often because

2488
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:11,850
they use this random
intermittent schedule.

2489
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:14,190
The random intermittent schedule
is one in which you don't

2490
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:17,340
really know when the peaks in
dopamine are going to arrive.

2491
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:19,830
And so there isn't this
expectation and craving.

2492
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:21,510
And then all of a sudden
when dopamine is released,

2493
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:22,410
it's extremely high.

2494
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,790
That's how they get you
to continue playing,

2495
01:41:23,790 --> 01:41:25,380
even though basically you're losing money

2496
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,370
and your dopamine is dropping,

2497
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:29,250
they elevate it every once in a while.

2498
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,770
Nicotine replacement can
be used in a similar way,

2499
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:32,910
but in a benevolent way,

2500
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:36,300
in order to help you get
over smoking or vaping

2501
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:39,090
by keeping the total
amounts of dopamine variable

2502
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:40,740
around the clock

2503
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:43,590
and by changing the amount
of dopamine that's released,

2504
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:47,010
it seems to help people
behaviorally and psychologically

2505
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:49,410
because they don't come to
expect having a particular amount

2506
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:51,780
of dopamine in their brain
and blood at any given time.

2507
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,700
And this is an important point

2508
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,850
because it brings us to
this notion of homeostasis.

2509
01:41:56,850 --> 01:41:59,520
Homeostasis is this tendency
for biological systems

2510
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,140
to try and reach equilibrium.

2511
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:02,610
What goes up, goes down, et cetera.

2512
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:04,532
And to some extent to the same degree.

2513
01:42:04,532 --> 01:42:05,850
So I'll talk about this right now

2514
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:09,900
in the context of nicotine use withdrawal,

2515
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:12,300
and then the period in which people

2516
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:14,550
no longer crave nicotine.

2517
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:16,290
So you can imagine that

2518
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:17,760
if we were to measure your heart rate,

2519
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,040
your blood pressure, and your
overall levels of alertness

2520
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,100
and wellbeing and mood, let's
just give that some value.

2521
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,800
Let's say it runs from zero
to 10, again, arbitrary units.

2522
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,020
Let's just take all those
physiological measures

2523
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:29,397
and the subjected measure of your mood.

2524
01:42:29,397 --> 01:42:30,610
And let's measure it

2525
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:35,010
four times an hour across the
day, across the waking hours.

2526
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,960
What we would find is a
line that would kind of

2527
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:37,793
squiggle a bit,

2528
01:42:37,793 --> 01:42:39,900
maybe a nice text comes
in that you really like,

2529
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,930
maybe you get not so good
news and your kind of

2530
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:45,360
autonomic arousal is all over the place,

2531
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,550
but on average is kind of a squiggly line

2532
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:48,840
where it increases in the morning

2533
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,760
because that's typically
when body temperature

2534
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,200
and autonomic arousal increase.

2535
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,280
And then towards the afternoon,

2536
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,300
it's going to come sloping down.

2537
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:55,140
And then right before sleep,

2538
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,340
there'll be an increase again,

2539
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,110
if you've ever felt that you
kind of run around a lot before

2540
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:59,310
sleep and then it goes down,

2541
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:03,570
that's kind of the typical contour
of autonomic arousal, mood,

2542
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:05,760
et cetera, across the day,

2543
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,660
removing of course life events
and things like psychiatric

2544
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:12,180
illness and depression and et cetera.

2545
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:13,950
That's the typical arc of that.

2546
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,810
Now let's superimpose on whatever

2547
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:18,840
that contour is for you, nicotine.

2548
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:21,780
So you get a little bolus as we say,

2549
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,970
a little bit of nicotine
from smoking a cigarette

2550
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:25,680
or from taking an
inhalation on a vape pen,

2551
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,690
what ends up happening is there's

2552
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:28,830
an increase in blood pressure,
increase in heart rate,

2553
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:30,390
increase in mood, increase in alertness,

2554
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:32,333
all the things we talked about earlier.

2555
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,280
Over time,

2556
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,280
the body starts to adjust so
that the baseline upon which

2557
01:43:40,830 --> 01:43:45,360
that nicotine induced increase
in arousal would occur

2558
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,790
is actually reduced, right?

2559
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:48,623
Why would that be?

2560
01:43:48,623 --> 01:43:51,180
Well, the body and the brain,

2561
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,070
your physiology seeks homeostasis.

2562
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:56,070
So if there's a big
increase in all those things

2563
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:57,960
like blood pressure and mood, et cetera,

2564
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,750
typically your baseline
will drop a little bit

2565
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:02,220
to compensate for that over time,

2566
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:05,070
after a couple days or even
weeks of ingesting nicotine.

2567
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,180
So let's say you wake up,

2568
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:08,880
you're typically take an
inhalation off your vape,

2569
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,260
or you have a cigarette around

2570
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:13,320
nine or 10:00 AM and you do that daily.

2571
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,750
You get used to a certain
level of mood and alertness

2572
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:17,460
and wellbeing for that time of day.

2573
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:19,140
And then if you smoke
again in the afternoon,

2574
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:22,350
let's say you also get accustomed
to a certain level of mood

2575
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:25,080
and alertness and wellbeing
for that time of day.

2576
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,850
Again, it'll vary
depending on life events,

2577
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,160
but your system sort of gets
used to it and your baseline

2578
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:31,020
will drop to compensate for those peaks

2579
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:33,210
so that the peaks aren't
quite as high as they were

2580
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:35,340
when you first started using nicotine.

2581
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:36,480
Now you decide to quit.

2582
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,570
So now what we're talking
about is transitioning from the

2583
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:42,270
consumption to what we're going
to call the withdrawal phase.

2584
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:44,190
So now what happens is you say,

2585
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:46,140
that's it, I'm going cold turkey.

2586
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:47,820
I know there's only a 5% success rate,

2587
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:50,610
but I'm going to just go cold
turkey or somebody will say,

2588
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:52,020
no, I'm going to use the Reveri app.

2589
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:53,760
Or somebody says, no,

2590
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,970
I'm going to use Bupropion or
another method or nicotine patch

2591
01:44:56,970 --> 01:44:58,260
or something of that sort.

2592
01:44:58,260 --> 01:44:59,700
Setting aside the nicotine patch

2593
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:01,530
or the nicotine delivery device

2594
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:04,920
and only focusing on
approaches for getting through

2595
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:09,300
withdrawal that have no
direct effects on nicotine.

2596
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,650
So not using the nicotine patch,

2597
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:14,160
but say the hypnosis or Bupropion,

2598
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:15,600
which can increase dopamine,

2599
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,420
but it doesn't increase nicotine directly.

2600
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:19,470
What happens?

2601
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:21,063
The day that you quit,

2602
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:25,140
that homeostatic mechanism
in your brain and body

2603
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,930
that sets your level of
mood and arousal, et cetera,

2604
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:30,960
does not know and hasn't
adjusted to the fact

2605
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,400
that you're not bringing in nicotine.

2606
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,450
You're not having that cigarette.

2607
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:35,880
You're not having that
inhalation on the vape pen.

2608
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:38,130
So what ends up happening
is that baseline,

2609
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:41,610
which has been adjusted
down to offset the increases

2610
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:43,710
in mood and alertness, et cetera,

2611
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:48,300
when you smoke or vape is lower
than it normally would be.

2612
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:52,950
So that 9:00 AM cigarette
time or vape inhalation time

2613
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:55,470
no longer feels above baseline,

2614
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:58,380
it actually feels below baseline
because what you're seeing

2615
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:03,380
is the lower amplitude
of arousal that was there

2616
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:05,940
to offset the increase you were getting

2617
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,320
from vaping or smoking.

2618
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,370
And then in the afternoon,

2619
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:10,530
if normally you have a kind
of phase of your afternoon

2620
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,760
you really enjoy, you go outside,

2621
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,500
you have a vape or a cigarette,

2622
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,706
you normally are feeling
relaxed or you go out at night

2623
01:46:15,706 --> 01:46:16,560
and you like to vape and you say, nope,

2624
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,060
I'm not going to do that anymore,

2625
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:19,350
you're going to feel much,

2626
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:22,440
much worse than you would've
had you never started

2627
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,430
smoking or vaping.

2628
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:25,434
Now that's not much help to anyone

2629
01:46:25,434 --> 01:46:27,810
who's already started smoking or vaping.

2630
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:30,900
But I say this because it's
very important to understand

2631
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,550
that the reason why relapse rates

2632
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:34,020
are so high within the first week,

2633
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:37,980
75% of people relapse within
one week and overall failure

2634
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:41,340
rates are 95% is because
people don't expect

2635
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:44,340
to feel even worse than they did prior

2636
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:46,080
to ever smoking or vaping.

2637
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,780
So that first week is absolutely critical.

2638
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,250
And the beauty of understanding this

2639
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,620
is that if you can get
through that first week,

2640
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:55,890
either by sheer grit or
by finding other methods

2641
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,830
to increase dopamine,
healthy methods I would hope,

2642
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:00,540
and certainly cold showers,

2643
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:03,237
ice baths have been shown
to do that by the way.

2644
01:47:03,237 --> 01:47:05,377
And this was described in
Dr. Anna Lembke's book,

2645
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,940
"Dopamine Nation", cold
showers can increase dopamine,

2646
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,400
exercise, positive social interactions.

2647
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,830
It's very likely that
people will need to use

2648
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:17,190
other healthy methods to offset
that reduction in dopamine

2649
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:19,830
if ever they stand to get
through that first week.

2650
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:22,380
And again, if you can get
through that first week,

2651
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,050
chances are quite a bit
higher that you'll be able to

2652
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:29,130
maintain the cessation
of smoking or vaping.

2653
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:32,040
And of course, hypnosis,
things like Bupropion,

2654
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,300
can also assist in that,

2655
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:36,270
Bupropion by way of increasing
dopamine pharmacologically,

2656
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:39,120
hypnosis through changes
in neural circuitry

2657
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,380
that aren't completely understood,

2658
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:43,800
but seem to involve a remapping
of some of the so-called

2659
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,410
default networks and some of
the networks that are involved

2660
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:48,930
in kind of understanding
of your own internal state.

2661
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,340
This stuff gets a little bit
complicated and we're going to

2662
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:52,980
return to this in a upcoming episode

2663
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,180
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2664
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:57,780
but there are indeed legitimate
changes in neural circuitry

2665
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,780
caused by clinical hypnosis
that can at least partially

2666
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:04,380
explain why it is so
effective in helping treat

2667
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:07,050
or allow people to stop
smoking and vaping.

2668
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:09,232
So for those of you out there

2669
01:48:09,232 --> 01:48:11,790
that, either here or
are saying yourselves,

2670
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:15,240
I just can't seem to
quit smoking or vaping

2671
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,310
or dipping or snuffing,

2672
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:20,940
hopefully an understanding of
how that homeostasis process

2673
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:23,490
works and the time course of nicotine,

2674
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,200
depending on the delivery device,

2675
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,730
hopefully understanding that

2676
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:29,910
will allow you to develop a protocol.

2677
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:30,990
Maybe it involves hypnosis.

2678
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:33,870
Maybe it involves just
understanding that the typical times

2679
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:37,920
in which you ingested nicotine
through any of the different

2680
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,050
approaches of bringing it into your system

2681
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:41,340
are going to be particularly hard.

2682
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:43,200
But I don't just mean particularly hard.

2683
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,033
I mean, particularly hard,

2684
01:48:44,033 --> 01:48:47,220
and you're going to need to do
something specific to offset

2685
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:50,580
that decrease in overall autonomic arousal

2686
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:52,200
and dopamine, et cetera.

2687
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,940
Hopefully an understanding
of that will allow you

2688
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:55,050
to get through that first week.

2689
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:56,910
And if you can make it
past that first week,

2690
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,730
you stand a very good
chance of never going back.

2691
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:02,430
However, I did consult
with Dr. David Spiegel

2692
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:04,380
in anticipation of this episode,

2693
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,520
regardless of the method
that you used to quit smoking

2694
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,923
or vaping, snuffing, or dipping,

2695
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:16,620
there's good evidence that
a routine maybe once a month

2696
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:21,620
or even once a week hypnosis
type approach to replenish

2697
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:24,660
or even enhance the neural
circuits that are allowing you to

2698
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:27,180
stay away from nicotine is
going to be a very good idea.

2699
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:31,440
And given that it's a purely
behavioral intervention,

2700
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,690
I can see no reason as to
why people wouldn't want

2701
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:35,010
to do that, go in and reinforce, you know,

2702
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:38,250
tighten the bolts on that
circuitry that are allowing you to

2703
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:41,580
not feel the impulse to smoke,
not feel the impulse to vape.

2704
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,860
And just a very brief mention,

2705
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:47,580
there is a vast literature on
the fact that when people have

2706
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:51,420
quit smoking or vaping or other
form of consuming nicotine,

2707
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,740
that when they consume alcohol,

2708
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:53,980
there's a much higher
probability of relapse.

2709
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:56,220
There are interactions
between alcohol and nicotine

2710
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,870
that we'll cover in future episodes.

2711
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,430
But for those of you that want to quit,

2712
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:00,780
I want to assure you,

2713
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:03,450
despite the fact that 95% of people fail,

2714
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:05,040
with the appropriate tools,

2715
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,800
and I like to think within an
additional understanding of

2716
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,110
the underlying biology and
psychology and what you can

2717
01:50:10,110 --> 01:50:12,270
expect and when to really
dig your heels and when to

2718
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:14,130
reinforce your system with more dopamine

2719
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:16,200
through any of the number
of the different protocols

2720
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,640
and tools that we've offered here

2721
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,720
and that you can find elsewhere

2722
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,210
in other episodes of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

2723
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:25,430
I have a high degree of confidence
that you can quit smoking

2724
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:27,690
or vaping, dipping or snuffing.

2725
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:29,310
So today, typical of frankly

2726
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,900
all episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2727
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,124
we've covered a lot about the biology

2728
01:50:33,124 --> 01:50:34,740
of a particular system.

2729
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:38,040
We talked about the biology
of nicotine in particular,

2730
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:42,180
we talked about vaping and
smoking, dipping and snuffing

2731
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:45,832
and the negative health
consequences associated with those.

2732
01:50:45,832 --> 01:50:47,760
I want to reemphasize that nicotine

2733
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,870
is not what causes cancer.

2734
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:51,450
It is the delivery
device that causes cancer

2735
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:53,490
and the other negative health effects.

2736
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:56,490
That is not to say that people
should be ingesting nicotine

2737
01:50:56,490 --> 01:50:57,390
through any different methods

2738
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:58,890
simply to get a cognitive boost.

2739
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:00,720
There are certain
circumstances where that might

2740
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,480
be appropriate for the
occasional work about,

2741
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,030
certainly not for physical exercise,

2742
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:07,650
given what we talked about earlier,

2743
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:09,900
but of course there are
more and more approaches

2744
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:12,090
to increasing, not just nicotine,

2745
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:14,580
but acetylcholine generally
in order to achieve

2746
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:16,560
cognitive enhancement
or physical enhancement,

2747
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,350
or I should say physical
performance enhancement.

2748
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:20,490
Some of those we talked about earlier,

2749
01:51:20,490 --> 01:51:22,050
such as Alpha GPC.

2750
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:24,720
In any event, nicotine,

2751
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,840
it should now be clear, is an
immensely powerful substance.

2752
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,000
One of the most commonly
ingested substances

2753
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,820
on the face of the earth and
has been for a very long time.

2754
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:35,340
And now that you understand
the underlying biology and the

2755
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:38,160
way in which this changes your
psychology and physiology,

2756
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:39,780
that should come as no surprise.

2757
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:41,970

2773
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:13,620
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2774
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:14,580
we talk about supplements,

2775
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:16,560
while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

2776
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,540
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

2777
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:21,660
for things like enhancing
sleep, hormone function,

2778
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:22,920
focus, and so on.

2779
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,330
The Huberman Lab Podcast is partnered

2780
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:28,170
with Momentous Supplements,
spelled momentous, O-U-S.

2781
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:29,490
You can find those supplements

2782
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:32,400

2783
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,570

2784
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:35,910
to the Huberman Lab Podcast
Neural Network Newsletter,

2785
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:37,230
it's a monthly newsletter.

2786
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:40,470
We provide summaries of
different podcasts and we provide

2787
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:42,420
summaries of specific
tools that you can use

2788
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:45,300
to enhance sleep for
instance, or enhance dopamine.

2789
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,860
We talk about deliberate cold exposure,

2790
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:47,910
deliberate heat exposure.

2791
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:49,230
It's very easy to sign up for,

2792
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:50,970
and it's completely zero cost.

2793
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:52,170
You go to hubermanlab.com,

2794
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:54,870
go to the menu, click on
newsletter, provide us your email.

2795
01:52:54,870 --> 01:52:56,640
We do not share it with anybody else.

2796
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,650
And you'll receive that
monthly newsletter, and there,

2797
01:52:58,650 --> 01:53:01,560
you can also find PDFs of
previous newsletters that you can

2798
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:04,200
immediate download without
even having to sign up.

2799
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,060
If you're not already
following us on social media,

2800
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:07,860
we are hubermanlab on Twitter,

2801
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:11,220
hubermanlab on Instagram,
and hubermanlab on Facebook.

2802
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:12,750
And at all of those locations,

2803
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:14,640
I describe science and
science related tools.

2804
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:16,350
Some of which overlap with the content

2805
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:17,730
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2806
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:19,020
much of which is distinct

2807
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,660
from the content covered on
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2808
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:22,493
So once again,

2809
01:53:22,493 --> 01:53:24,690
I'd like to thank you for
joining me today for a discussion

2810
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:27,510
about the biology and
psychological effects of nicotine,

2811
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:29,400
this incredibly powerful substance.

2812
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:31,953
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

2813
01:53:31,953 --> 01:53:34,536
