00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,760
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,104
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:09,370
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,560
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,946
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,360
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,500
Today, we're going to talk
about science-based protocols

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,200
for sleep, mood, learning,

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
nutrition, exercise of various kinds,

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,040
strength and endurance, and hypertrophy,

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,120
and we are going to talk
about some protocols

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,320
that relate to creativity.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,310
We're going to talk about
behavioral protocols,

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,060
supplement based protocols,

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,460
all science backed by quality,
peer-reviewed literature.

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,280
The reason that we're
holding this episode now is

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,400
that in the recent previous episodes,

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,420
we've covered some pretty
intense and in-depth topics.

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,880
We've talked about vision and how we see

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,460
and how to get better at seeing
and how to maintain vision.

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,690
We've talked about hearing and balance.

23
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,710
We've talked about chemical sensing.

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,890
And we had a guest episode

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,350
that covered a lot of
information about new

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,140
and emerging technologies in neuroscience,

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,640
as well as mental health.

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,260
That was the interview episode
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.

29
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,300
So given that we've covered
so much detailed information

30
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,400
in the previous 27 episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,240
I decided that we would hold office hours.

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,160
Office hours in the university setting are

33
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,860
when students come to
the professor's office

34
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,480
or you meet outdoors on
campus or in the classroom

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,650
to review the material and questions

36
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,410
from lecture in more detail.

37
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,370
Now, unfortunately, we
don't have the opportunity

38
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,780
to meet face to face in
real life, but nonetheless,

39
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,310
you've been sending your questions,

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,880
putting them in the comment
section on YouTube, et cetera,

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,650
and I prepared a number of answers

42
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,620
to the questions that have
shown up most frequently.

43
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,810
Now, in order to provide context

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,550
and structure to the way

45
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,290
that we will address these questions,

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,070
I've arranged the science
and science-based protocols

47
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,690
that relate to various aspects of life-

48
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,610
such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking,

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,630
anxiety, creativity, et cetera-

50
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,640
into the context of a day.

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,229
Selecting the unit of a day in order

52
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,909
to deliver this science information

53
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,490
and protocols is not a
haphazard decision on my part.

54
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,610
It's actually the case that
every cell in our body,

55
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,880
every organ in our body,

56
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,170
and our brain is modulating or changes

57
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,710
across the 24 hour a day

58
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,060
in a very regular and predictable rhythm.

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,035
And it's no coincidence
that the Earth spins once

60
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:31,653
on its axis every 24 hours.

61
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,520
These two things are
coordinated by virtue of genes

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,030
and different proteins and things

63
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,660
that are expressed in
every cell of your body.

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,750
And so selecting the unit of the day

65
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,190
is not just a practical one,

66
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,403
but it's one that's related
to our deeper biology.

67
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,980
You may have heard in my interview episode

68
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,700
with Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself,

69
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,210
in order to juggle a tremendous workload,

70
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,440
a full-time clinical practice,
a lab of 40 plus people,

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,443
a family of five children, et cetera,

72
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,510
breaks up his life into units of days.

73
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,060
And so today we are going
to further dissect the day

74
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,400
as a unit that one can manage
and manage extremely well,

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,380
and, in fact, can optimize.

76
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,270
So we're basically going to talk about

77
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,180
how to leverage science-based protocols.

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,310
And when I say science, I mean,

79
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,770
quality, peer-reviewed science published

80
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,560
in excellent journals.

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,540
We're going to talk about
how to take that science,

82
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,400
convert it into specific
protocols that break up

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,550
along the course of a single day

84
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,170
and direct certain types of behaviors

85
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,330
in order to optimize the
various features of life.

86
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,760
I will couch this in
the context of what I do

87
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,960
across a daily 24-hour rhythm.

88
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,290
That doesn't mean that you
have to follow this schedule

89
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,310
at all or even in part.

90
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,680
It's just by way of example.

91
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,010
Any number of the different things

92
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,970
that I describe could
be applied to any number

93
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,360
of different schedules or frameworks.

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,890
But if there's one truth
that applies to all of us,

95
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,360
is that we all have to exist

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,020
within the context of this 24 hour rhythm

97
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,210
that we all possess.

98
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,150
So that's what we'll focus on.

99
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,090
Before we begin,

100
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,180
I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate

101
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,560
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,810
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

103
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,600
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

104
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,560
and science-related tools
to the general public.

105
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,690
In keeping with that theme,

106
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,550
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

107
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,790
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

108
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,070
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

109
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,370
that I believe are the very
highest quality possible.

110
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,030
Developed by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,

111
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,460
ROKA sunglasses and
eyeglasses were developed

112
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,450
with their intention to create sunglasses

113
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,210
and eyeglasses that
could be worn anywhere.

114
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,250
So while exercising or while working,

115
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,360
at home, while driving.

116
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,920
The reason I like ROKA glasses

117
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
so much is that first of all,

118
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,150
they're extremely lightweight.

119
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,950
The optical clarity of
the lenses is excellent,

120
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,400
and so I often just forget
that I have even have them on.

121
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,810
When I'm outside and
I'm wearing sunglasses,

122
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,070
they have this really terrific feature

123
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,940
which is that I can move
in and out of shadows

124
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,360
or the cloud cover can change

125
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,000
and I can see perfectly
well the entire time.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,230
You know, many eyeglasses and
sunglasses that I've tried,

127
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,910
depending on what we call the
"ambient lighting conditions,"

128
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,800
the local lighting conditions outside,

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,480
I have to take them off
or put them back on.

130
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,620
It's really annoying for me.

131
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,720
But with ROKA glasses, somehow,

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,340
I'm assuming because they
really understand the science

133
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,940
of the visual system,

134
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,450
the eyeglasses and
sunglasses work seamlessly

135
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,850
with whatever environment you're in.

136
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,470
So that's absolutely terrific.

137
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,340
Another thing about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses is

138
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,710
that their aesthetic is really terrific.

139
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,150
You know, I don't think
I'm alone in saying

140
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,370
that many performance
glasses as they're called end

141
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,040
up making people look like a cyborg,

142
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,970
but the sunglasses are of
the sort that, you know,

143
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,810
you can wear while running or biking

144
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,330
or driving or out to dinner.

145
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,480
I don't typically wear
sunglasses while out to dinner,

146
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,313
but you get the idea.

147
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,930
You can wear them anywhere
and they look very natural.

148
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,960
They have a huge number of
different styles to select from.

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,660

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,040
and enter the code huberman at checkout.

155
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,305
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

156
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,640
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

157
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,300
that analyzes data from your blood

158
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,780
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

159
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,000
and help you reach your health goals.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,940
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

161
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,510
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

162
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,600
that impact your immediate

163
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,010
and long-term health can only be analyzed

164
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,860
from a quality blood test.

165
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,980
With InsideTracker, it
alleviates a specific problem

166
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,810
that's associated with most, if not all,

167
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,460
of the other blood tests
and DNA tests out there.

168
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,400
And that problem is you get information

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
back about the levels of various things,

170
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,650
metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

171
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,660
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

172
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,950
With InsideTracker, they
have this terrific dashboard

173
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,850
that allows you to both see
your levels of hormones,

174
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,710
metabolic factors, and the rest,

175
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,770
but also, it suggests specific
things that you can do

176
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,530
with your nutrition, your
exercise, and lifestyle,

177
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,339
and so forth in order
to bring those levels

178
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,880
into the ranges that are
best for your immediate

179
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,510
and long-term health.

180
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,970
In addition, they make the whole process

181
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,040
of getting your blood
and DNA taken very easy.

182
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,540
They'll even come to your
home to take the sample.

183
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,300
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

184
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,270
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.

185

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,490
Just use the code HUBERMAN at checkout.

188
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,230
That's insidetracker.com/huberman

189
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,600
to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

190
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,590
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

191
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,900
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

192
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,820
that are ideally matched your sleep needs.

193
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,610
I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

194
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,300
about eight months ago,

195
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,590
and I can honestly say it's the best sleep

196
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,830
that I've ever had in my entire life.

197
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,890
And that's because the mattress

198
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,860
was actually designed for me.

199
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,930
And you can have a
mattress designed for you.

200
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,680
If you go to helixsleep.com,

201
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,600
they have this free, very
brief, two-minute quiz

202
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,170
that asks you a number of questions

203
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,990
like do you sleep on
your side or your back?

204
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,550
Do you tend to run warm while you sleep

205
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,900
or do you tend to get cold
in the middle of the night?

206
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,550
Maybe you don't know the
answers to those questions,

207
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,310
and that's fine too.

208
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,310
After taking that quiz,

209
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,920
they will match you to a specific mattress

210
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,200
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

211
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,270
I matched to the
so-called "Dusk Mattress,"

212
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,610
D-U-S-K, because I wanted a
mattress that was not too firm,

213
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,600
not too soft.

214
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,463
As I mentioned, I absolutely love it.

215
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,210
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

216
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,270
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

217
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,740
take their two-minute sleep quiz,

218
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,940
and they'll match you
to a customized mattress

219
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,580
and you'll get up to $200
off your mattress order

220
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,750
and two free pillows.

221
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,870
They also make these terrific pillows.

222
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,130
They have a 10-year warranty

223
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,510
and you get to try out the mattress

224
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,673
for 100 nights risk free.

225
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:39,770
If you don't like it,

226
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,024
they'll come pick it up
and they'll take it away,

227
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:43,140
but I think you'll love it.

228
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,380
I certainly love mine.

229
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,330
Again, if you're interested,

230
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,290
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman

231
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,390
for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

232
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,210
So let's talk about how to apply quality,

233
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,190
peer-reviewed science to your day

234
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,530
and how to optimize everything
from sleep to learning,

235
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,623
creativity, meal timing, et cetera.

236
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,680
As I mentioned earlier,

237
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm going to do this in
the context of my day

238
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,920
and what I typically do.

239
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,230
However, the specific protocols

240
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,010
for any number of different things,

241
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,313
sleep, relaxation, meal
timing, exercise, et cetera,

242
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,590
any one or all of those
could be rearranged

243
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,950
to suit your specific needs.

244
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,130
I'm going to tell you what I
do from morning until waking

245
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,420
and even what I do while I sleep in order

246
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,310
to optimize my sleep.

247
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,550
So let's start with
getting up in the morning.

248
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,700
Now, for me, I tend to wake
up sometime around 6:00 AM,

249
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,240
6:30, sometimes as late as 7:00 AM.

250
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,530
I don't typically sleep
much later than 7:00 AM.

251
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,090
The first thing I do after
I wake up is I take the pen

252
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,270
that's on my nightstand

253
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,170
and the pad of paper on my nightstand

254
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,260
and I write down the
time in which I woke up.

255
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,740
Now, I do sleep with my phone in my room.

256
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,910
I realized this is considered a sin

257
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,930
and has certain hazards
associated with it,

258
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,680
but I put my phone on airplane mode

259
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,070
about an hour before I go to sleep.

260
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,400
And then I set my alarm
typically for 6:30 AM.

261
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,340
And some days the alarm wakes me up;

262
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,760
other days I wake up before the alarm.

263
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,560
And yes, some days the alarm goes off

264
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,150
and I hit snooze a few times,

265
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,990
and then usually by 7:00
AM, I am up and out of bed.

266
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,340
The reason for writing
down what time I wake up is

267
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,283
because I want to know
that average wake up time.

268
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,950
That average wake up time informs

269
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,900
what's called my "temperature minimum."

270
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,920
It tells me when my body
temperature was lowest.

271
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,510
The temperature minimum is the time

272
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,340
in each 24-hour cycle that your
body temperature is lowest.

273
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,320
I don't sleep with a thermometer
in my mouth or elsewhere,

274
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,310
and I don't think you should either.

275
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,158
Instead, I know that
the lowest temperature

276
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:53,158
that my body will be at
across the 24-hour cycle tends

277
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,120
to be two hours before
my typical wake up time.

278
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,870
And I want to know that number.

279
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,250
It's called our "temperature minimum."

280
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,630
So if you're somebody that
typically wakes up at 8:00 AM,

281
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,310
then your temperature minimum
is sometime around 6:00 AM.

282
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,070
Remember, the temperature
minimum is a time

283
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,740
in the 24-hour cycle.

284
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,680
I don't care what my
actual temperature is;

285
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,240
I care when my lowest temperature is.

286
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,960
And I know that that lowest temperature

287
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,053
is approximately two hours
before my average wake-up time.

288
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,900
So I highly recommend that you write down

289
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,550
when you wake up or track that in some way

290
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,130
that works for you and use
that as a reference point

291
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,480
to determine your temperature minimum.

292
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,820
We will return to the temperature minimum

293
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,270
and how you can leverage
the temperature minimum

294
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,750
for several things:

295
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,892
shifting your clock,

296
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:48,090
shifting your circadian sleep
schedule and wake schedule.

297
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,170
Also for shifting your
eating schedule, et cetera,

298
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,440
We will return to that.

299
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,005
But even if you don't travel,

300
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,940
even if you don't care
about things like jet lag,

301
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,880
even if you sleep
fabulously all year round,

302
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,570
never have a poor night's sleep,

303
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,000
knowing your temperature minimum,

304
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,360
that time when your temperature
is at its lowest point,

305
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,030
is a valuable thing to know.

306
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,330
The second thing I do after I wake up is

307
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,560
to get into forward ambulation,

308
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,620
which is just nerd
speak for taking a walk.

309
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,450
I have a dog, and as many of you know,

310
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,460
he's a bulldog and he
doesn't really like to walk,

311
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,130
especially not in the morning.

312
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,440
But for humans and for animals,

313
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,230
there's a phenomenon whereby

314
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,110
when we generate our own forward motion,

315
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,423
forward ambulation,

316
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,400
visual images pass by us on our eyes,

317
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,430
so-called "optic flow."

318
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,800
And for those of you that
are low vision or no vision,

319
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,320
the same phenomenon occurs
in the auditory system.

320
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,357
Sounds pass by us in
so-called "auditory flow."

321
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,290
Getting into a mode of forward ambulation,

322
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,250
and especially experiencing visual flow,

323
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,920
has a powerful effect
on the nervous system.

324
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,415
The effect it has is essentially

325
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,310
to quiet or reduce the
amount of neural activity

326
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,240
in this brain structure
called the "amygdala."

327
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,690
Amygdala means "almond,"

328
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,480
and many of you have probably
heard about the amygdala

329
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
for its role in anxiety and
fear and threat detection.

330
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,220
And indeed, the amygdala
is part of the network

331
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,850
in the brain that
generates feelings of fear

332
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,010
and threat and anxiety.

333
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,280
It does a bunch of other things too,

334
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,400
but that's one of its primary functions.

335
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,950
There are now at least half a
dozen quality papers published

336
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,360
in quality, peer-reviewed
journals that show

337
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,270
that forward ambulation,
walking or biking or running,

338
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,130
in generating optic flow in particular

339
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,220
has this incredible property
of lowering activity

340
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,760
in the amygdala and thereby
reducing levels of anxiety.

341
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
There are two papers that I'd like

342
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,530
to highlight in particular
that relate to this phenomenon.

343
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,650
The first one was published
in the journal Neuron

344
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,610
and the title of this paper

345
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,790
is "Whole-Brain Functional
Ultrasound Imaging,"

346
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,410
that just means they have a cool technique

347
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,700
to evaluate the activity
of structures in the brain

348
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,260
across the entire brain,

349
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,363
reveals brain modules for
visual motor integration.

350
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,020
What they found in this study,

351
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,740
and I should mention the
first author is Mace,

352
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,340
this comes from Botond Roska's group,

353
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,220
this was work done in mice,

354
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,440
but I'll talk about other
species in a moment.

355
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,560
What they found was essentially that

356
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,060
when these mice walk forward

357
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,680
and their eyes move from side to side,

358
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,910
which is a natural
consequence of moving forward,

359
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,930
so-called "optic flow" is
flowing past their eyes,

360
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,850
many brain areas are activated,

361
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,690
increase in their level of firing,

362
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,803
but the amygdala in particular
reduced its levels of firing.

363
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,250
That's a very interesting
finding, but it is in mice.

364
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,447
However, another paper,

365
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,730
"Eye-Movement Intervention
Enhances Extinction

366
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,110
via Amygdala Deactivation,"

367
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,850
was published in The
Journal of Neuroscience,

368
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,290
a strong journal, and shows that, again,

369
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,370
these eye movements, these
lateral eye movements

370
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,830
from side to side reduce activity levels

371
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,390
in this fear/threat/anxiety center

372
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,740
in the brain, the amygdala.

373
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,750
Now, those are eye movements.

374
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,680
They didn't specifically
look at forward ambulation.

375
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,010
And yet other papers have
looked at forward ambulation

376
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,880
and we know that forward
ambulation, walking forward,

377
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
generates the sorts of eye movements

378
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,040
that cause optic flow and
reductions in amygdala activation.

379
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,653
So for me, this process of taking

380
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,610
a walk each morning isn't about exercise.

381
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,090
It's not about burning calories.

382
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,580
It's not about any of that.

383
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,480
It's really about getting into optic flow

384
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,150
and reducing the levels
of amygdala activation.

385
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,950
Now, I don't have anxiety,

386
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,630
at least I don't have chronic anxiety

387
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,150
or generalized anxiety.

388
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,610
I tend to have a lot of energy,

389
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,270
but at these points in the morning,

390
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,630
I'm not very energetic.

391
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,440
Sometimes I'm sort of shuffling more

392
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,500
than I'm walking in fact.

393
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,977
And Costello is almost always shuffling

394
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:55,380
and I'm almost always trying
to drag him first thing

395
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,560
in the morning.

396
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,080
But that walk is a particularly
important protocol each day

397
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,750
because it really serves
to push my neurology

398
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,380
in the direction that I'd like it to go,

399
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,320
which is alert, but not anxious.

400
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,880
And it's kind of a fine line sometimes,

401
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,400
especially as events
surface throughout the day,

402
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,730
emails come in, text messages come in,

403
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,300
get bombarded with a number of things.

404
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,930
I want to be alert and responsive.

405
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,050
I want to be able to focus,

406
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,720
but I don't want to. feel anxious

407
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,670
or reactive to these things.

408
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,850
So the forward ambulation and
this optic flow is the way

409
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,320
that I ensure, based on
quality, peer-reviewed data,

410
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,480
that my amygdala activation
is slightly suppressed.

411
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,570
Now, at the same time, I
also want the alertness.

412
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,200
I want alert and focused.

413
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,050
I don't just want to be sleepy
or super, super relaxed.

414
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,660
I want to have a high degree
of focus and alertness

415
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,140
because I'm soon going to
move into a about of work.

416
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,030
I need to lean into the day.

417
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,503
So in order to do that,

418
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,010
I make sure that the
walking is done outdoors.

419
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,490
That might be sort of a duh,

420
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,480
but many people get up and
start moving around their house,

421
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,370
their apartment, and
they don't go anywhere.

422
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,680
And just walking around inside,

423
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,359
it will generate some optic flow,

424
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,119
but nothing like the sort of optic flow

425
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,699
that you can generate
in larger environments

426
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,260
like out of doors environments.

427
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,369
If you can't get outdoors,

428
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,749
doing it indoors is perfectly fine,

429
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,170
but it's not going to
have the same magnitude

430
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,890
of positive effect.

431
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,630
Now, in order to get the alertness,

432
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,869
I do it outdoors because I
also want sunlight in my eyes.

433
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,940
I know many of you have heard
me talk about this ad nauseam

434
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,350
on various podcasts, in this podcast,

435
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,050
but getting sunlight in
your eyes first thing

436
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,160
in the morning is absolutely vital

437
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,010
to mental and physical health.

438
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,490
It is perhaps the most
important thing that any

439
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,830
and all of us can and should do in order

440
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,520
to promote metabolic well-being,

441
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,530
promote the positive functioning
of your hormone system,

442
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,880
get your mental health steering
in the right direction.

443
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,170
There are a number of reasons for this,

444
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,820
but before I get into those reasons,

445
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,590
let me just emphasize
what the protocol is.

446
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,240
The protocol is get outdoors,

447
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,970
ideally with no sunglasses
if you can do that safely,

448
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,800
even if there's cloud cover.

449
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,640
More photons, light information are coming

450
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
through that cloud cover
than would be coming

451
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,760
from a very bright indoor bulb.

452
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,580
So getting outdoors is absolutely key.

453
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,950
How long should you do this?

454
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,930
It's going to depend on the
brightness of the environment.

455
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,540
It's going to depend on a
number of different factors.

456
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,630
Two minutes would be a minimum,

457
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,610
10 minutes would be even better,

458
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,470
and if you can, 30 minutes
would be fantastic.

459
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,680
Now, it's a very bright day or, you know,

460
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,450
you live in a place where
there's bright sunlight,

461
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,010
clear day on a snowfield,

462
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,250
you would only need
something like 60 seconds.

463
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,400
But most people aren't living
in those sorts of conditions.

464
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,320
So getting outside for a 10-minute walk

465
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,650
or a 15-minute walk will basically ensure

466
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,910
that you're getting adequate
stimulation of these neurons

467
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,750
in the eye that are
called the "melanopsin,"

468
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,710
intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells.

469
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,850
I know that's a mouthful.

470
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,130
These are neurons that don't
care about shapes of objects

471
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,470
or the motion of objects.

472
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,140
These are neurons that convey to the brain

473
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,560
that it's daytime and
it's time to be alert.

474
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,640
And it sets in motion a huge
number of biological cascades

475
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,130
within every cell and organ of your body

476
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,370
from your liver to your gut,

477
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,700
to your heart, to your brain.

478
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,800
It really sets things down the right path.

479
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,030
Early in the day,

480
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,640
we experience a natural and healthy bump

481
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,390
in a hormone called "cortisol."

482
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,780
Cortisol comes from the amygdala.

483
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,090
That cortisol, as I mentioned,

484
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,950
is healthy and normal
and promotes wakefulness.

485
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,780
It actually promotes a
healthy immune system.

486
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,230
So I know you've heard that stress

487
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,760
and cortisol disrupt the immune system,

488
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,330
but not the short little pulse of cortisol

489
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,590
that you get each morning.

490
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,400
It's very important that that pulse

491
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,183
of cortisol arrive early in the day.

492
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,480
I want to emphasize this again.

493
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,040
It's very important that that pulse

494
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,410
of cortisol arrive early in the day

495
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,470
And that pulse of cortisol
is going to happen

496
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,560
once every 24 hours no matter what.

497
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,470
It's going to happen
and you get to time it.

498
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,640
How do you time it?

499
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,950
Primarily by when you view bright sunlight

500
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,310
or bright light of another kind,

501
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,000
and we'll talk about that in a moment.

502
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,330
So you want that cortisol pushed early.

503
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,200
If you wake up before the sun comes out,

504
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,110
it's fine to turn on artificial lights,

505
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,640
but then you would want to get outside

506
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,710
as soon as you can to get this, excuse me,

507
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,950
natural light stimulation of your eyes.

508
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,750
And it does have to be to your eyes.

509
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,523
Just to really drill down
into the details for a moment,

510
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,120
you don't want to stare
directly at the sun

511
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,360
or any light that's so
bright that it feels painful.

512
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,193
If you feel like you have

513
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,380
to close your eyes or blink, please do.

514
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,610
You don't want to damage your retinas.

515
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,920
The point here is to get
the sunlight indirectly.

516
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,800
It's going to essentially
be scattered everywhere

517
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,100
through the cloud cover,

518
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,770
but you know from looking at
us at a flashlight directly

519
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,760
into that flashlight
versus looking at the beam

520
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,000
that flashlight generates on the ground

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,280
that if you're standing in the shade,

522
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,960
you're going to. get less of that sunlight

523
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,600
than you are if you're
out in an open field.

524
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,410
So this is why the time outside,

525
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,558
it's going to need to vary depending

526
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:00,130
on your particular environment.

527
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,010
But do your best to do this every day.

528
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,240
If you miss a day, no big deal,

529
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,430
but try not to miss more than one day.

530
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,920
Otherwise your mental

531
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,160
and physical health will start to suffer.

532
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,260
And doing this each day costs nothing.

533
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,093
It's just time

534
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,970
You can combine it with the
forward ambulation with the walk

535
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,870
and the optic flow that
I talked about before.

536
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,860
And that's what I do each morning

537
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,660
to generate a sense of
alertness in my body

538
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,950
and brain to generate a
sense of calm, yet alert.

539
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,130
And that's also what I do with
Costello, with my bulldog.

540
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,963
People have asked me,

541
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:33,500
do the same mechanisms apply to animals?

542
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, the reality is
many of these mechanisms

543
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,250
were actually discovered in animals,

544
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,360
and then were tested in humans

545
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,760
and verified that they
also exist in humans.

546
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,593
Not always.

547
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,740
Sometimes it was the reverse,

548
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,490
where they were tested first in humans,

549
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,150
and then brought to animals.

550
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,880
But indeed, your dog, your horse,

551
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,380
you know, I don't know what
other animals are out there,

552
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,550
they need this.

553
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,590
Now, if you have a hamster
or a nocturnal animal,

554
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,020
the reason why they like to
run on their wheels at night is

555
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,400
because they're nocturnal.

556
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,470
They don't like being in the light.

557
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,940
Light actually causes
them to freeze, right?

558
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,310
Actually, if you are into
aquaria, you like fish,

559
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,220
they always say, "Don't
overfeed your fish.

560
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,053
You'll kill the fish."

561
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:13,730
That's true, but guess
what the fastest way

562
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,820
to kill a fish is?

563
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,060
To keep the lights on 24 hours a day

564
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,310
They also need circadian
rhythms, these 24-hour rhythms.

565
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,750
So we'll do an entire month at
some point about pet health,

566
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,780
but meanwhile, get that morning sunlight.

567
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,530
So now we have a first protocol,

568
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,480
which is to write down the
time of day that you wake up,

569
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,590
the second protocol is to
take a walk first thing

570
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,423
in the morning,

571
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:38,440
and the third protocol is
woven in with that walk,

572
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,360
at least for me, which is to
get that sunlight exposure.

573
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
Now, if you can't get sunlight exposure,

574
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,830
you absolutely can't,

575
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,790
I don't necessarily recommend buying one

576
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,893
of these dawn alarm lights.

577
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,190
And I'm sorry to say this,

578
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,230
but they're just vastly
overpriced relative

579
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,063
to what they are.

580
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:58,750
They're basically a bright LED.

581
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,031
I instead use, I have a pad
that's a 930-lux LightPad.

582
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,170
I think it was designed for drawing.

583
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,730
Those are available at
a fraction of the cost

584
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,410
that a morning light
simulator would provide,

585
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,580
and yet it's really bright
enough, at least for me.

586
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,670
I tend to put it on my desk
while I work each morning.

587
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,950
So here's a principle
that you can leverage.

588
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,580
If you want to be alert,
view bright lights

589
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,250
and make those lights above
you or in front of you.

590
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,080
If you want to go to sleep soon

591
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,110
or you don't want to be
awake for whatever reason,

592
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,010
try and eliminate your exposure to light.

593
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,000
And this, again, is not about
exposure of the skin to light;

594
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,870
this is about exposure of your eyes,

595
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,230
of your neural retinas to light.

596
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,350
For those of you that are
concerned about blue light,

597
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,310
I want to that blue light
is precisely the wavelength

598
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,820
of light that is optimal for
stimulating these neurons

599
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,010
in your eye, which set your
circadian rhythms properly.

600
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,070
So you don't want to shield yourself

601
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,610
from blue light early in the
day or throughout the day

602
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,810
or anytime you want to be awake.

603
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,010
In fact, that could have a number

604
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,940
of detrimental consequences.

605
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,590
Fortunately, all those
consequences are going

606
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,870
to be reversible after a short
period of time of making sure

607
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,280
that you don't wear your blue blockers

608
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,750
during the day, please.

609
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,943
The time to wear blue blockers, if you do,

610
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,680
is at night and in the evening

611
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,510
when you're headed towards sleep.

612
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,330
My colleague Samer Hattar,

613
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,230
who is head of the chronobiology unit

614
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,420
at the National Institute
of Mental Health,

615
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,180
has spoken about this
before on my Instagram.

616
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,767
We held an Instagram Live and I said,

617
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,920
"Samer, what do you think
about blue blockers?"

618
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,510
And he said, "I don't think
that's a good idea at all,

619
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,010
unless it's really late at night

620
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,560
and you're in a bright environment

621
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,740
and you're trying to limit
the amount of bright light

622
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,107
that impacts the eyes."

623
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,700
Eliminating specific wavelengths of light,

624
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,530
in Samer's opinion and also in my opinion,

625
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,077
is not a natural thing
for the visual system

626
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:50,880
and the brain to experience.

627
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,150
Some people get headaches while they work

628
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,920
on the computer all day
or staring at screens,

629
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,370
and so they get blue blockers
thinking that's going

630
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,340
to protect them from their headaches.

631
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,570
However, any protection
that you get from headaches

632
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,990
from blue blockers is going to be minimal

633
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,480
in comparison to what's
really going on there,

634
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,330
which is that people are viewing devices

635
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,000
and screens up close for too many hours

636
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,743
throughout the 24-hour cycle.

637
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,640
A better remedy would be to step away

638
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,770
from that computer from time to time,

639
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,580
and to make sure that you can look far off

640
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,413
into the distance.

641
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:24,550
Ideally, a distance longer than 20 feet

642
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,580
like view a horizon, go out on a balcony,

643
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,413
things of that sort.

644
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,460
Take a walk around, get into optic flow

645
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,260
So if you're into blue blockers,

646
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,690
make sure you're only wearing
them in the late evening

647
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,560
and at night.

648
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,410
I personally don't wear
blue blockers at all.

649
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,980
I prefer to just control
my light viewing behavior

650
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,360
by doing this, I do the other
form of circadian control,

651
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,250
which is to dim the lights.

652
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,850
And I do that because dimming the lights

653
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,260
and setting them lower in the
environment sets up the brain

654
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,700
and body for sleep much better

655
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,790
than simply just wearing some
blue light blue blockers,

656
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,623
excuse me.

657
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:59,150
And please know if you
do wear blue blockers

658
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,920
that if the light in your
environment is bright enough,

659
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,230
it doesn't matter if you're
blocking out the blues.

660
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,900
The cells in the eye will respond

661
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,910
to other wavelengths of light.

662
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,890
So I have no vendetta
against the blue blockers,

663
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,110
and, you know, I fully
expect the blue block-anistas

664
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,700
to come after me with,
I guess, blue blockers,

665
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,950
but as you do that,

666
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,400
please understand that the biology points

667
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,210
in the direction of get
a lot of bright light

668
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,710
throughout the day, including blue light,

669
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,620
and at night, just limit the
total amount of overall light

670
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,800
that you're exposed to,
including from screens.

671
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,100
So then Costello and I
get back from our walk.

672
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,540
Sometimes that walk was 10 minutes,

673
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,140
sometimes it was 60 minutes,

674
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,080
depending on how slowly
Costello is walking that day.

675
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,330
Indeed, many mornings I'm
the guy carrying his bulldog

676
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,640
back up the hill.

677
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,860
My neighbors know me so well,

678
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,050
they know Costello so well

679
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,270
that they've since stopped pulling over

680
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,140
and asking if the dog is okay.

681
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,840
Sometimes they'll ask if I'm okay.

682
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,460
Nonetheless, we get back,
I give him his food,

683
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,033
I give him his water,
and I give me my water.

684
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,640
I'm a big believer, based on
quality, peer-reviewed data,

685
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,270
that hydration is essential
for mental performance.

686
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,380
Now, I confess I don't really
like drinking big glasses

687
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,180
or big jugs of water first
thing in the morning.

688
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,013
I don't know why,

689
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:13,200
but my thirst doesn't tend
to kick in first thing.

690
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,250
You may be different.

691
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,170
Either way, I force myself, essentially,

692
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,170
to drink at least 16 and,
most days, 32 ounces of water.

693
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,890
I also put a little bit
of sea salt in the water.

694
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,640
As many of you know,
neurons require ionic flow.

695
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,260
What that means is neurons need sodium,

696
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,100
they need magnesium,
and they need potassium

697
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,840
in order to function.

698
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,020
We do tend to get dehydrated at night.

699
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,840
Even if the day is not very hot,

700
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,040
I try and top off or I try and make sure

701
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,560
that I'm hydrated early in the
day before I begin any work.

702
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,490
So I make myself drink this water

703
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,670
with a little bit of sea salt.

704
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,503
How much sea salt?

705
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:53,930
If you really want to get detailed,

706
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,700
I suppose it's about half a teaspoon.

707
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,470
It's not much, That's what I do.

708
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,170
And I drink that more or
less room temperature.

709
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,080
I find that drinking really
cold water first thing

710
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,410
in the day kind of like
cramps up my insides,

711
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,443
so I don't do that.

712
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,350
At that point, I start thinking about

713
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,870
and fantasizing about
and craving caffeine,

714
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,350
but I don't drink that caffeine yet.

715
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,640
I purposely delay my caffeine intake

716
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,410
to 90 minutes to 120
minutes after I wake up.

717
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,340
Of course, I know when I wake
up 'cause I wrote it down,

718
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,400
although it's pretty
easy to commit to memory.

719
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,170
The reason I delay caffeine is

720
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,290
because one of the factors

721
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,380
that induces a sense of
sleepiness is the buildup

722
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,967
of adenosine or, as some people call it,

723
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,690
adenosine in our system.

724
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,830
The buildup of adenosine accumulates

725
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,700
the longer we are awake.

726
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,250
So when I wake up in the morning,

727
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,580
when you wake up in the morning,

728
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,480
your adenosine levels are
likely to be very low.

729
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,880
However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker.

730
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,090
It's actually a competitive
antagonist for you aficionados.

731
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,570
It sort of parks in the receptor

732
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,140
that adenosine normally would park at

733
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,380
and prevents adenosine from
acting on that receptor.

734
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,620
That's why you feel more alert,

735
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,430
because it's essentially
blocking the effect

736
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,190
of this sleepiness factor

737
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,290
that we all create called the "adenosine."

738
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,660
The reason for delaying
caffeine intake 90 minutes

739
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,330
to two hours after waking
is I want to make sure

740
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,700
that I don't have a late afternoon

741
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,950
or even early afternoon
crash from caffeine.

742
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,660
One of the best ways to
ensure a caffeine crash is

743
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,390
to drink a bunch of caffeine,

744
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,200
block all those adenosine receptors,

745
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,830
and then by early or late afternoon,

746
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,760
when that caffeine starts to wear off

747
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,630
and gets dislodged from the receptors,

748
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,820
a lower level of adenosine is able

749
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,010
to create a greater level of sleepiness.

750
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,620
It took me years to figure this out.

751
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,683
I used to wake up and I'd think,

752
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:51,980
"Oh, I don't want to drink
caffeine too close to bedtime,

753
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,100
so I'm going to start drinking
my caffeine really early."

754
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,290
I let my cortisol naturally
come up in the morning.

755
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,750
I avoid drinking caffeine
until about 90 minutes

756
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,850
or two hours after waking.

757
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,810
And when I do that,

758
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,750
I find that I don't experience
the afternoon crash.

759
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,630
At least I don't experience that crash

760
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,070
unless I do something foolish,

761
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,180
like ingest far too much food at lunch

762
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,690
or I stay up all night the night before.

763
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,010
But provided I don't do
anything foolish like that,

764
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,480
delaying caffeine to 90 minutes

765
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,120
to two hours optimizes this relationship

766
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,970
between adenosine and
wakefulness and sleepiness

767
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,170
in a way that really provides a nice,

768
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,200
consistent arc of energy
throughout the day

769
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,240
and brings energy down as
I'm headed toward sleep

770
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,820
and falling asleep.

771
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,160
My primary objective early in the day is

772
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,150
to get into a mode of being focused,

773
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,313
yet alert so that I can get work done.

774
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,160
I found that the best way for me

775
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,900
to achieve that state is through fasting.

776
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,520
So I don't eat anything until
about 11:00 AM or 12:00 noon.

777
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,480
I'm not absolutely religious about it.

778
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,470
There are days when I'll
have a few Brazil nuts

779
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,390
or a spoonful or three of almond butter,

780
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,430
for instance, but most
days I'm not doing that.

781
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,340
I'm just not eating anything.

782
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,130
I'm drinking some caffeine caffeine source

783
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,590
for me is yerba mate, guayusa tea.

784
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,040
Those are my preferred sources

785
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,740
I tend to avoid coffee these days.

786
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,730
Occasionally I'll have a cup,

787
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,780
but most often I stick to the teas.

788
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,774
I drink water as much as I
feel I need to and want to.

789
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:21,590
And I also drink my athletic greens,

790
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,083
which is compatible at
least for me with fasting.

791
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,750
Let's talk about why fasting works

792
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,150
to create this heightened
state of alertness,

793
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,623
yet calm brain state.

794
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,780
Fasting increases levels of adrenaline,

795
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,260
also called "epinephrin"
in the brain and body.

796
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,030
And when our levels of epinephrin

797
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,000
and adrenaline are
increased, we learn better,

798
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,010
we can focus better.

799
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,470
There's terrific data supporting that.

800
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,270
You don't want epinephrine,
aka adrenaline, too high.

801
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,270
That feels like stress and panic.

802
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,350
You get jittery, you can't focus.

803
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,490
But in its optimal range,

804
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,890
adrenaline really provides
a heightened sense of focus

805
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,830
and the ability to
encode, meaning bring in,

806
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,280
and retain, remember information.

807
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,000
And so since my job is
mainly a cerebral one

808
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,470
where I'm writing grants and
working on papers, et cetera,

809
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,960
I fast in the early part of the day.

810
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,860
I mentioned ingesting things
like guayusa or yerba mate

811
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,560
or, in my case, athletic greens.

812
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,160
Many people ask, in fact
there's a whole community

813
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,650
and discussion boards, et cetera,

814
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,460
and YouTube comments on the internet,

815
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,470
about what breaks a fast and what doesn't.

816
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,110
The fact of the matter is that's going

817
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,460
to be highly individual because it's going

818
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,600
to depend on how sensitive
your blood sugar.

819
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,790
And more accurately,

820
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,850
it's going to depend on things

821
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,800
like your insulin sensitivity.

822
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,470
So for instance,

823
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,590
if you're somebody who
gets up in the morning,

824
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,940
hydrates, and goes out for a six-mile run,

825
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,750
you could probably eat
a jar of almond butter

826
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,719
and still be what's called fat-fasted.

827
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,950
Your insulin levels will still be very low

828
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,700
because even though that is a
large volume of almond butter,

829
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,330
even to me and Costello,

830
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,680
that large number of calories comes

831
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,550
from a source that doesn't
increase blood sugar very much

832
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,560
and insulin very much.

833
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,490
Now, I'm not suggesting you do that,

834
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,290
but what I just described as
a vastly different situation

835
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,110
than somebody that ate
their last meal at 2:00 AM,

836
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,620
and that meal was essentially a feast.

837
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,313
And for that person,

838
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,090
fasting until 10:00 or 11:00 AM,

839
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,830
their blood sugar might
still actually be pretty high

840
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,730
or even lowish such that
they might eat one almond

841
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,720
and it would bump them out of fasting.

842
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,553
So you get the idea.

843
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,570
It's going to depend on
your recent eating history,

844
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,320
your blood sugar history, your
glycogen stores, et cetera.

845
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,960
So if anyone tells you that
breaks a fast or that doesn't,

846
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,793
that's kind of silly.

847
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:47,530
Would one grain of sugar
break your fast? No.

848
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,430
Would an entire tablespoon of
sugar break your fast? Yes.

849
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,580
You'll get a big blip in blood
sugar and insulin from that.

850
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,200
However, how long that lasts,

851
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,080
how long it breaks your fast will depend

852
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,120
on how glycogen-depleted you are

853
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,820
and a number of other factors.

854
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,230
So for me, I just keep it fairly simple:

855
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,160
I ingest water, caffeine from
your yerba mate and guayusa,

856
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,699
and I drink my athletic greens
with some lemon juice in it.

857
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,989
That constitutes my fasting.

858
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,049
And there are days when
I do all those things.

859
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,150
There are days when I
do none of those things.

860
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,110
Although most days,

861
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,880
I would say about 355
days out of the year,

862
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,150
I'm ingesting water, caffeine,

863
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,520
and athletic greens during this period

864
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,760
of fasting early in the day,

865
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,469
and that's the period of
time when I do my work.

866
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,726
One interesting fact about yerba mate

867
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:34,769
and guayusa teas is that
they increase release

868
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,889
of something called "GLP-1."

869
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,019
GLP-1 is related to glucagon.

870
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,620
Glucagon is a hormone
that you can sort of think

871
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,250
about as opposite to
insulin and blood sugar.

872
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,400
It's more complex than that,

873
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,270
but GLP-1 has a couple
of positive properties.

874
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,907
One is it increases lipolysis

875
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:54,300
and mobilization of body fat stores,

876
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,830
so burning of fat.

877
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,280
In fact, there are now a
number of clinical trials

878
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,860
that are achieving good success

879
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,750
and there are drugs out
there only available

880
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,650
by prescription which mimic GLP-1

881
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,323
and are being used to
treat, quite successfully,

882
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,760
certain types of diabetes and obesity.

883
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,720
Now, I'm not diabetic,

884
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,970
nor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat,

885
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,850
but I figure as long as I'm fasting

886
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,190
and as long as I like
yerba mate and guayusa,

887
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,800
which I do, they're delicious,

888
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,340
I'll tell you which
type I use in a moment,

889
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,330
I might as well increase my GLP-1

890
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,510
because it's probably not
as good as getting out

891
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,780
and doing some cardio work.

892
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,680
But nonetheless, if I'm fasted,

893
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,600
increasing GLP-1 in my system,

894
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,870
I'm going to be alert from
the caffeine, the adrenaline,

895
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,990
et cetera, and I'm going
to burning body fat

896
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,960
while I'm doing my work.

897
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,360
So for me, it's just an
efficient, biochemically rational,

898
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,840
or I should say grounded

899
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,150
in quality biochemistry sort of approach.

900
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,480
Yerba mate comes in a
lot of different forms.

901
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,170
There are a lot of different
brands out there, et cetera.

902
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,890
I don't have any relationship whatsoever

903
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,420
in a business sense to
any of these brands.

904
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,780
Some of them are very smoky.

905
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,810
I, just because of something
in my genetic makeup,

906
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,360
or I don't know, maybe it was some sort

907
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,510
of Y chromosome-associated
lesion early in life,

908
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,070
but I don't like smoky flavors.

909
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,240
So I'm not a Gouda cheese guy.

910
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,450
I don't like smoky stuff.

911
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,570
You may love it,

912
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,313
but I tend to avoid smoky-tasting mates.

913
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,840
Instead, there's a particular
brand that I just found

914
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,490
on the internet called Anna Park.

915
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,370
I don't know Anna, I don't
know if she has a park,

916
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,130
and I certainly don't
know what Anna Park is,

917
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,270
but for me, that's the
best-tasting yerba mate.

918
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,370
Again, I don't have any
relationship to them,

919
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,960
but it's affordable in
the context of yerba mate

920
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,590
and it's the one that I use.

921
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,740
And I should mention along
the lines of affordability

922
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,840
and GLP-1 is there's a
nice feature of yerba mate

923
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,450
which is if you put it in a filter

924
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,720
or a metal strainer and
you pour hot water over it,

925
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,240
and then drink it, keep the leaves.

926
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,300
The yerba mate leaves can
be used over and over again.

927
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,230
It seems that the GLP-1
stimulating aspects of yerba mate

928
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,680
actually are enhanced with
subsequent pour overs.

929
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,700
So there's something
interesting about these teas

930
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,650
that my tea aficionado
friends tell me allows the tea

931
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,940
to release more of some of
the beneficial compounds

932
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,660
by reusing the tea leaves.

933
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,930
Now, eventually it'll grow mold

934
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,100
and other sorts of disgusting things.

935
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,500
You don't really want
to run that experiment.

936
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,450
I would say you can
use it for a day or two

937
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,740
before it starts to go bad,

938
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,570
but that's a feature
that will extend the life

939
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,080
of whatever yerba mate you happen to use

940
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,960
if you decide to use it,

941
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,870
and that's certainly what I do.

942
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,550
Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing

943
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,800
while I'm drinking all this yerba mate.

944
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,380
'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking

945
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,140
about all the GLP-1
circulating in my system.

946
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,620
I'm working.

947
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,960
A couple of things for
optimizing workspace

948
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,490
that are grounded in
neuroscience and physiology.

949
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,860
I've talked before about the fact that

950
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,960
when our eyes are directed upward,

951
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,770
literally when our eyelids are open,

952
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,780
no surprise there, and when
our eyes are directed upward,

953
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,760
it creates a state of
heightened alertness.

954
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,970
And this has a relationship
to the brainstem neurons

955
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:05,380
that create alertness and their control

956
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,940
over the muscles of the eye and,

957
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
believe it or not, the eyelids.

958
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,030
Now, it's not the case that if
you are absolutely exhausted

959
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,590
and you need to feel more alert

960
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,070
that looking upward is going
to make you feel wide awake,

961
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,963
although it will help support
your levels of alertness.

962
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,960
The point here is that you
can optimize your workstation

963
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,450
in a physical way that
leverages this aspect

964
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,770
of the visual system and
your level of alertness.

965
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,370
Since most of us want to be
awake while we're working,

966
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,560
try and position your
screen or your tablet,

967
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,980
whatever device you
happen to be working on,

968
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,090
at least at eye level and
ideally slightly higher.

969
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,150
Now, if you think about it,
most people are not doing this.

970
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,780
Most people are looking down
at their computer or tablet

971
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,660
or are angling their eyes at their screen

972
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,253
at about 30 degrees.

973
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,960
That is not going to support
heightened states of alertness

974
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,530
and optimal attention.

975
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,910
In fact, the opposite relationship

976
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,610
between eye position and
alertness is also true.

977
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,130
When we look down, when our
eyelids are slightly closed,

978
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,200
it tends to decrease
our levels of alertness

979
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,183
and increase our levels of sleepiness.

980
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,640
I really want to emphasize this,

981
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,344
that there's a bi-directional
or reciprocal relationship

982
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:17,860
between the brainstem areas

983
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,840
that control alertness and the eyes,

984
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,320
meaning how alert you are controls

985
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,100
how open or closed your
eyes are, no surprise there,

986
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,580
but also the how open and
upward directed your eyes are

987
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,820
will increase your levels of alertness

988
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,360
And if your eyes are pointed downward

989
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,300
and your eyelids are hooded,

990
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,830
like they're slowly closing,

991
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,500
like Costello's are always are,

992
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,430
you'll feel more sleepy,

993
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,730
especially if you're somebody

994
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:44,140
who tends to have that
mid-morning sleepiness

995
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,800
or mid-morning crash.

996
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,870
So what I do is I have a standing desk,

997
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,130
but I also prop the computer up

998
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,790
such that it's at least at eye level.

999
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,260
And I haven't figured out yet

1000
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,220
how to develop a workstation
where the computer is above me.

1001
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,480
I think the only way to really do

1002
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,940
that is actually to tilt one's body back,

1003
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,363
but actually that's
not a good idea either.

1004
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,780
They have done studies
recording from areas

1005
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,260
of the brain associated with alertness.

1006
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,760
Areas like locus coeruleus

1007
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,513
in the so-called reticular
activating system.

1008
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,300
What they found is that depending

1009
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,300
on how reclined you
are or upright you are,

1010
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,590
you will decrease with reclining

1011
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:23,820
and increase with sitting
forward your levels of alertness.

1012
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,960
So body posture and
whether or not your upright

1013
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,830
or reclining will impact
your levels of alertness

1014
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,860
in the predictable ways.

1015
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,690
And where you position your eyes,

1016
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,110
whether or not your eyes
are upright, so to speak,

1017
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,290
looking up or directly
forward or looking down,

1018
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,950
will dictate whether or not
you are feeling more alert

1019
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,030
or more sleepy, respectively.

1020
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,070
So try and arrange a workstation

1021
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,860
or a position of your body in your chair

1022
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,690
or your standing desk, whatever it is,

1023
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,100
that allows you to work

1024
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,400
with a heightened state of alertness.

1025
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,720
This is really, really key for me

1026
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,490
because I found that
when I would sit down,

1027
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,150
not only would my hip
flexors start to get sore,

1028
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,110
I feel tight in the back, et cetera,

1029
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,670
but if I was staring
down at my screen all day

1030
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,140
or even for short periods of the day,

1031
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,460
I would start to feel sleepy

1032
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,730
and I couldn't figure
out what was going on.

1033
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,130
I also thought maybe I needed glasses.

1034
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,210
I do wear readers at night,

1035
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,320
but it was really a problem.

1036
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,660
And simply by getting the screen directly

1037
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,290
in front of me at eye level,

1038
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,270
it's been completely transformative.

1039
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,460
So we're now at the description of my day

1040
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,330
in these protocols in which I would do

1041
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,990
a 90-minute about of work.

1042
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,170
Now, why 90 minutes?

1043
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,940
Well, the brain is going

1044
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,530
through these 90 minutes
so-called "ultradian cycles"

1045
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,250
throughout the entire day and night.

1046
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,390
Every 90 minutes, we shift
over from being very alert

1047
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,150
to being less alert, and
then back to alert again.

1048
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,680
Here's how it works.

1049
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,370
At the start of one of these
90 minute ultradian cycles,

1050
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,350
my brain is not quite engaged

1051
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,930
in whatever it is I'm trying to do.

1052
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,940
Oftentimes I have things
jumping into my mind,

1053
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,880
I've got distractions, et cetera.

1054
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,510
I'll talk about how to deal
with those distractions

1055
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,790
in a moment.

1056
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,300
But I set a timer for 90 minutes

1057
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,040
and I try and get a strong
about of work done inside

1058
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,990
of that 90 minutes with
the full understanding

1059
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,940
that the entire 90 minutes is not going

1060
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,480
to be uniform in terms
of my ability to focus.

1061
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,310
There will be kind of peaks
and valleys within that,

1062
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:22,070
but that 90 minutes is about
what the brain can handle

1063
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,340
in terms of a dedicated effort
for high degree of focus.

1064
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,200
Some people can push out
a little bit further,

1065
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,320
some people can't handle
more than 10 minutes,

1066
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,870
but that's what I'm striving toward.

1067
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,990
You'd be amazed how much you
can get done in 90 minutes

1068
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,823
if you are focused.

1069
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,270
So how do you increase that focus

1070
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,090
and how do you use the timer feature?

1071
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,610
Well, you can combine those.

1072
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,310
I use a program called Freedom.

1073
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,130
It shuts me out of the
internet completely.

1074
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,750
So that means no checking the markets,

1075
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,340
no checking social media, no checking,

1076
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,350
you know, the news, no
checking email, none of that.

1077
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,103
I get a dedicated about of work done.

1078
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,330
I confess, I don't allow
myself to go to the restroom

1079
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,230
in that period of time.

1080
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,510
Here's an interesting little tip

1081
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,950
that's grounded in physiology.

1082
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,720
You have a direct neural
connection from your bladder

1083
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,330
to your brainstem areas
that increase alertness.

1084
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,980
This is why when you have
to go to the bathroom,

1085
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,690
when you have to urinate, it
is extremely agitating, right?

1086
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,940
It can be very, very agitating.

1087
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,140
I'm not encouraging you to get

1088
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,740
so agitated by filling
your bladder so much

1089
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,080
and resisting going to the bathroom

1090
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,400
that you are uncomfortable
and can't focus,

1091
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,420
but I generally will just drink liquids

1092
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,560
and work away and work away,

1093
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,610
and I won't walk away
to go use the bathroom

1094
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,770
unless I absolutely have to.

1095
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,000
Sort of odd that we're talking about this,

1096
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
but this is one way in which I've learned

1097
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,430
to funnel my attention into
whatever it is I'm doing.

1098
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,263
Because as you all know,

1099
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:50,040
the moment you sit down
to do some serious work

1100
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,450
and you flip off the internet,

1101
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,720
all of a sudden it's as
if the phone has a voice,

1102
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,553
it starts calling you..

1103
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:57,020
It's almost as if the
restroom has a voice.

1104
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,950
But we all are familiar with the fact

1105
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,970
that if we are focused on something

1106
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,840
that all that just kind of melts away.

1107
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,980
So the goal is to get into
what I call the tunnel,

1108
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,650
to really get into a
tunnel of quality work.

1109
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,660
The brain loves that state,

1110
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,480
but it's very hard for
many of us to access.

1111
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,770
My phone is absolutely off.

1112
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:15,930
It's not on airplane mode.

1113
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,660
It's absolutely off during this time.

1114
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,770
If I've been struggling with that and,

1115
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,990
I confess, you know, there are times when,

1116
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,080
for whatever reason,
something going on in life,

1117
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,120
it's been harder to put away the phone.

1118
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,920
I will sometimes put it in my car.

1119
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,330
I used to joke that I used
to throw it up on the roof

1120
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,410
or something like that.

1121
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,270
Look, I've done and I suggest
people do whatever they need

1122
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,340
to in order to
self-regulate that activity.

1123
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,860
And if you're somebody that
feels that you absolutely need

1124
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,870
to be on your phone and on the
computer for this work about

1125
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,130
or the work that you do,

1126
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,470
well, that's a different
matter altogether.

1127
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,040
This is just simply how I work.

1128
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,280
So I will do 90 minutes
and I do set a timer

1129
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,410
and I turn on the program,

1130
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,670
Freedom locks me out of the internet.

1131
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,723
If someone rings the doorbell,

1132
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,757
I will often shout,

1133
00:44:58,757 --> 00:45:00,470
"Not coming to the
doorbell. Leave it there."

1134
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,750
I mean, unless there's a real emergency,

1135
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,850
I'm not going to step away from that work.

1136
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,320
I learned how to do this
when I was a graduate student

1137
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,640
under different conditions
where I used to slice brains

1138
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,177
on what's called a microtome.

1139
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:12,010
So I used to spend time,

1140
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,430
just cutting very thin slices,

1141
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,540
it's like a deli slicer, but for a brain,

1142
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,240
of various types of brains.

1143
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,010
And I've sectioned
through a lot of brains.

1144
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,080
And we had a rule,

1145
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,470
which is that when the
blade hits the brain,

1146
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,930
you don't stop pulling, even
though it's very, very slow

1147
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,440
even if a nuclear bomb goes off,

1148
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,810
even if a fire alarm goes off.

1149
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,910
Now, I don't want anyone,
you know, burning to a crisp

1150
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,520
because they didn't step
away from their workflow.

1151
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,353
That would be foolish,

1152
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:41,970
but that's the mentality
that I've embedded in myself,

1153
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,680
that there's nothing more important

1154
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,970
than what I'm doing in
that 90-minute block.

1155
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:47,880
And that's what works for me.

1156
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,450
You can try various other things.

1157
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,080
That's what works for me.

1158
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,920
In addition, I use low level white noise.

1159
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,670
This is something that is supported

1160
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,880
by quality, peer-reviewed data.

1161
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,370
We covered this on the episode
on hearing and balance,

1162
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,610
but it turns out that white noise,

1163
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,143
which is essentially all
frequencies of sound,

1164
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,600
or all frequencies of
sound that we can perceive,

1165
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,860
mixed up kind of randomly,

1166
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,250
there's no structure to it,

1167
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,170
turned on at a low volume,

1168
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,510
not with headphones most of the time,

1169
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:21,170
puts the brain into a state that's optimal

1170
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,740
for learning and workflow.

1171
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,900
And I covered two papers
during that episode.

1172
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,603
One that showed that, indeed,

1173
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,470
brain areas involved in attention,

1174
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,360
brain areas involved in focus
and cognition and memory,

1175
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,790
those are engaged to a greater degree

1176
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,700
when there is low levels
of white noise playing

1177
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,730
in the background.

1178
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:43,470
The other paper that's really
interesting did brain imaging

1179
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,780
and showed the areas of the
brain that are associated

1180
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,480
with dopamine release are increased

1181
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,640
by low levels of white noise.

1182
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,680
Dopamine release is associated
not just with pleasure,

1183
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,960
but with motivation and craving.

1184
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,830
So everything about this 90-minute block

1185
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,250
from the low levels of white noise

1186
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,030
to the position of my computer,

1187
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,960
how I'm standing, where
my eyes are positioned,

1188
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,810
is geared towards putting
me in this tunnel of work.

1189
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,790
And I have to say that
while it can be a challenge

1190
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,320
to try and achieve this state

1191
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,880
in this tunnel of work some days,

1192
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,520
you start to get kind of addicted to it.

1193
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,940
It feels really good.

1194
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,400
It's like a workout for the mind.

1195
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,960
And it is something that as
you exit that 90 minutes,

1196
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,110
you really feel like
you've accomplished a lot

1197
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,810
because often you have,

1198
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,060
and it just feels deeply satisfying.

1199
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,990
And I'm convinced that that's

1200
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:30,010
because of the release of
neuromodulators like dopamine

1201
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,770
and the norepinephrine that's
circulating in your system.

1202
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,930
And I want to be clear
that I'm not perfect

1203
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:36,850
about this 90 minutes.

1204
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,530
Occasionally I get drawn away.

1205
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,900
Occasionally something will happen

1206
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,220
or I'll go use the restroom
or Costello will have a need

1207
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,210
or somebody will have a need

1208
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,260
that I will have to respond to,

1209
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,560
but I really try and achieve
this most, if not every day

1210
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,610
that I'm alive because for me,

1211
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,610
that work session is kind of holy.

1212
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,710
It's where I set up a relationship,

1213
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,430
not just between me and
the work that I'm doing,

1214
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,750
but between me and my ability

1215
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,910
to control my own state of mind
using these various supports

1216
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,160
of the white noise, et cetera.

1217
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,810
But really those supports are peripheral

1218
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,620
to the fact that I'm creating this space.

1219
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,610
I'm funneling my brain into a state

1220
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,640
rather than allowing
whatever events and contexts

1221
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,050
on social media and
elsewhere might be occurring

1222
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:24,310
in the world that would
yank me out of what

1223
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,560
for me is my purpose
and my mission in life,

1224
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,450
which is to do the
sorts of work that I do.

1225
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,130
There's a powerful way in
which you can place the timing

1226
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,423
of this 90-minute work
about in an optimal way.

1227
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,290
You have access to a very
important piece of data

1228
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:43,620
that dictates when this about
should start more or less

1229
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,770
and when it should end.

1230
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,710
That piece of data is
your temperature minimum.

1231
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,860
If you're somebody who wakes
up on average at 7:00 AM,

1232
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,730
well, then your temperature
minimum is 5:00 AM.

1233
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,440
And you can be reasonably sure,

1234
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,490
I want to underscore reasonably,

1235
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,430
but you can be reasonably sure

1236
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,280
that your best work is
going to be done anywhere

1237
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,350
from four to six hours after
your temperature minimum.

1238
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,980
So for me, I tend to
wake up around 6:30 AM,

1239
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,000
that means my temperature
minimum is at 4:30 AM.

1240
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,100
You can add five hours to that.

1241
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,280
So that means that a 90
minute work about could fall

1242
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,460
at 9:30 AM and it would
be fairly optimized.

1243
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,750
Or I could do it at 10:30 AM,
or I could do it at 8:30 AM.

1244
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,470
Somewhere in there, all right?

1245
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,730
That we can't say that
it's exactly six hours

1246
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,760
after your temperature minimum.

1247
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,260
You will find it, however.

1248
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,970
There is a precise and best time

1249
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,690
for you to do this 90-minute work about.

1250
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,050
Whether or not it's five or six hours

1251
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,380
after your temperature minimum is going

1252
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,150
to vary from person to person.

1253
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:44,983
How do I know this?

1254
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,160
How do I know this relationship

1255
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,950
between temperature minimum
and focus cognition?

1256
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,373
Well, temperature minimum
defines the trough,

1257
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:54,366
the nadir, as they say,

1258
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,770
of your temperature
across the 24-hour cycle.

1259
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,550
And immediately after that,

1260
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,950
your temperature will start to rise.

1261
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,620
That temperature rise is
actually what triggers

1262
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,450
the initial cortisol
release that you experience

1263
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,730
and wakes you up further.

1264
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,720
And then, of course, that
sunlight that you're getting

1265
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,900
is going to further enhance

1266
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,160
that healthy release of cortisol.

1267
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,430
That cortisol will then
provide fuel, if you will,

1268
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,870
for that increase in temperature.

1269
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,450
And your body will continue
to increase in temperature

1270
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,970
throughout the day toward the afternoon.

1271
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,250
What you're trying to do in this idea

1272
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,780
of optimizing this 90-minute work about

1273
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,010
to a particular time of day

1274
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,730
is catch the portion of the steepest slope

1275
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,340
of that temperature rise.

1276
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,890
Now, again, you're not walking
around with a thermocouple

1277
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:42,950
or a thermometer in some
orifice of your body.

1278
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,670
So you don't have accurate
information about temperature,

1279
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,570
but you can make very good guesses

1280
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,020
about when your body
temperature is rising fastest

1281
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,590
by virtue of that temperature minimum.

1282
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,970
So again, just to be clear,

1283
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,580
it's a 90-minute work about.

1284
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,080
That's about what the brain can handle

1285
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,813
for a very intense work about.

1286
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,160
Do you understand, again,

1287
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,930
that they're going to be
portions of that 90 minute

1288
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,860
that your brain is flickering
in and out of focus,

1289
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,760
other portions, where you're
going to be entirely focused.

1290
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,070
That's entirely normal.

1291
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,350
But when to place that
90-minute work about,

1292
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,880
when to start it, and when
to end it will depend on

1293
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,810
that temperature minimum.

1294
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,330
So if you're somebody who wakes
up at 8:00 AM each morning,

1295
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,220
your temperature minimum is 6:00 AM,

1296
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,600
chances are you're going to

1297
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,010
want to start this work about
somewhere around 10:00 AM

1298
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,370
or 11:00 AM.

1299
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,480
Now, some people wake up and
feel very alert first thing

1300
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,313
in the morning.

1301
00:51:32,313 --> 00:51:33,880
They can really do their
best work first thing

1302
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,810
in the morning.

1303
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,530
Please, if that's you continue to do that.

1304
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,050
Leverage that time. Use that time.

1305
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,410
But if you're somebody who
struggles to find focus,

1306
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,024
definitely let your physiology

1307
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:48,750
and this rise in your body
temperature support your efforts

1308
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,790
to focus rather than
trying to do your best work

1309
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,880
at times of day when your physiology

1310
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,217
is actually directing your body

1311
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:59,020
and your brain toward de-focus

1312
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,480
and towards being more lethargic.

1313
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,980
It just is setting yourself up for success

1314
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,130
when you try and capture this rising phase

1315
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,130
of your temperature.

1316
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,150
So up until now,

1317
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,120
we've been emphasizing practices

1318
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,520
that allow you to optimize
your level of alertness

1319
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,563
and your levels of mental focus.

1320
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:20,300
Data going back to the
1990s supports the idea

1321
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,150
that physical movement of particular kinds

1322
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,293
can support brain health
and brain function both

1323
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:27,793
in the immediate term
and in the long term.

1324
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,650
Now, this is has had a profound impact

1325
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,120
on the field of neuroscience, but frankly,

1326
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,510
it's also had a profound impact on

1327
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,180
how I structure my day.

1328
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,340
So after I've finished a about of work,

1329
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,150
this 90-minute about of work,
I force myself some days,

1330
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:43,983
other days I want to,

1331
00:52:43,983 --> 00:52:47,270
but I force myself to do some
sort of physical exercise

1332
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,830
that is going to be
supportive of my brain health

1333
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,850
and brain function and organ health

1334
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,940
and bodily function in general.

1335
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,210
So I just briefly want to touch

1336
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,670
on what the structure of
that exercise looks like,

1337
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,980
how it's structured within the day

1338
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,363
and how it's structured
across the weeks in fact,

1339
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,200
based on the scientific data

1340
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,810
and what the scientific data say is best

1341
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,260
or optimal in order to promote
longevity of the brain,

1342
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,557
ability to focus, as well
as cardiovascular health

1343
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:17,570
and all the other things that
we know exercise supports.

1344
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,010
Now, there are various
forms of physical activity

1345
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,800
or what we call exercise,

1346
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,260
but those can generally be
batched into two categories.

1347
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,240
First is strength and hypertrophy work.

1348
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,500
So physical movements that are designed

1349
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,683
to make you stronger and/or
make your muscles larger.

1350
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,220
There's also endurance work.

1351
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,620
Physical exercise and
movements that are designed

1352
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,980
to allow you to do more work over time

1353
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,000
or to extend the amount of
time that you can do work

1354
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,370
of any kind, both physical and mental.

1355
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,750
And we did two full podcast
episodes on the details

1356
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,890
and the science and the protocols
related to these topics.

1357
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,470
We did an episode on
the science of strength

1358
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,100
and hypertrophy, of building
strength and muscle building.

1359
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,010
And that included a lot of protocols.

1360
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,440
And we did an episode on endurance.

1361
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,300
How to build any one or all of
the four types of endurance,

1362
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,920
which are muscular endurance,
anaerobic, aerobic,

1363
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,760
long-distance endurance, et cetera.

1364
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,190
So if you're interested in the
specifics of those protocols,

1365
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,543
please see those episodes.

1366
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,970
However, right now I
just want to emphasize

1367
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,150
how the data impact my day

1368
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,840
and how I structure my day in a way

1369
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,050
that I can incorporate physical movement

1370
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,390
in a way that supports
my brain and health.

1371
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,650
Basically, after I finished
that cognitive work about,

1372
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,340
that 90-minute work about,

1373
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,150
I do some form of physical
exercise for about an hour.

1374
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,740
The data all point to the
fact that working out hard

1375
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,700
for longer than an hour
can actually be detrimental

1376
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,190
because of the way that
it raises cortisol.

1377
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,610
And cortisol can be a good thing

1378
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,870
if it's appropriately timed

1379
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,520
and in the appropriate low levels,

1380
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,220
but you don't want to have
your cortisol levels up

1381
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,000
throughout the day or have big spikes

1382
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,120
of cortisol repeatedly.

1383
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,060
So keeping workouts relatively short

1384
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,720
can definitely help with that

1385
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,400
And certainly if you're training hard,

1386
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,000
60 minutes or less should
be more than sufficient.

1387
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,400
And for many people, including myself,

1388
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,563
45 minutes or 50 minutes is
probably even more optimal.

1389
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,130
The basic design of this
physical exercise is

1390
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,530
that it be approximately 60 minutes.

1391
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,620
So maybe 60 plus or minus
15 minutes should be well

1392
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,560
within the margins of keeping
hormonal health proper

1393
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,140
and not going too long
nor making the workout

1394
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,600
so short that it's not beneficial.

1395
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,880
And essentially what the data tell us is

1396
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,860
that in order to optimize cardiovascular

1397
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,260
and brain health and
other systems of the body,

1398
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,920
we want to exercise at
least five days per week.

1399
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,700
I know that seems like a lot.

1400
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,690
It certainly is a lot for certain people.

1401
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,730
Some of you, you compulsive exercisers,

1402
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,930
might gasp at the idea
of taking two days off.

1403
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,890
I personally find that taking
two full days off per week

1404
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,180
is actually both beneficial

1405
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,750
to my exercise training performance,

1406
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,680
as well as pleasant.

1407
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,933
I like those rest days.

1408
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,100
But essentially the structure
of the exercise regimen

1409
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,880
that works for sake of
supporting health is going

1410
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,690
to be one in which there's a 3:2 ratio.

1411
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:14,580
Where for a 12-week period
or so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks,

1412
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,520
three of those five workouts
per week emphasize strength

1413
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,030
and hypertrophy and the other
two emphasize endurance.

1414
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,640
Then, after 10 or 12 weeks,

1415
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,640
one over to a 10- or 12-week
regimen of doing a 3:2 ratio

1416
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,880
where you're prioritizing endurance work.

1417
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,640
So primarily the sorts of
workouts that are described

1418
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,760
in the endurance episode
and those protocols.

1419
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,593
And the other two days,

1420
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:38,250
you're focusing on strength
and hypertrophy work merely

1421
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,800
to maintain strength and hypertrophy,

1422
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,030
to not lose the strength and hypertrophy

1423
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,250
that you've created.

1424
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,620
And there a lot of data
now supporting the fact

1425
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,830
that maintaining muscular health

1426
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,540
and bone health is supported
by resistance training,

1427
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,770
weight training of various kinds.

1428
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,540
It can also be done with body weight

1429
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,300
if you don't have access to equipment.

1430
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,620
And, of course, that doing
cardiovascular endurance work

1431
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,540
is very beneficial both to
the muscles of the body,

1432
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,340
the organs of the body,
but also to the brain.

1433
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,790
Many of you have probably heard

1434
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,500
that doing physical exercise

1435
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,010
of various kinds can
support the production

1436
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,740
of new neurons in the brain.

1437
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,210
Frankly, those data are
specific to research animals.

1438
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,920
As far as we know,

1439
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,120
increases in neuron
number are not supported

1440
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,460
by exercise in humans.

1441
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,170
There is a little bit
of data that supports

1442
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,890
that maybe a few neurons
might get created by running

1443
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,820
or weightlifting or things
of that sort in human beings,

1444
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,740
but there's still a host of other reasons

1445
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,230
to have this hour or so per day

1446
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,010
where one is doing physical exercise.

1447
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,350
And those include increased
blood flow to the brain.

1448
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:44,920
Remember, the brain is an organ too.

1449
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,960
It's the most metabolically
demanding organ in your body

1450
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,360
and it's receiving
those metabolic factors,

1451
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,150
it's receiving its fuels
by way of vasculature,

1452
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,000
of blood vessels and capillaries and veins

1453
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,330
and things of that sort.

1454
00:57:57,330 --> 00:58:00,100
So movement is very crucial

1455
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,050
to get your brain to function properly.

1456
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,120
Movement of various
kinds is very important

1457
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,080
to get your brain to function properly.

1458
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,690
Resistance training turns
out to be as important

1459
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,220
as endurance training because of the way

1460
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,430
that it stimulates the release

1461
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,910
of particular hormones
actually from bones,

1462
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,620
things like osteocalcin,

1463
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,120
which can positively impact brain function

1464
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,590
and can support the
health of existing neurons

1465
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,560
as opposed to increasing
the number of neurons.

1466
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,670
It turns out increasing the number

1467
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,020
of neurons may not actually
be as beneficial as we think.

1468
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,310
It all sounds great. More
neurons, more neurons.

1469
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,410
Certainly more neurons is
better than fewer neurons

1470
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,770
and losing neurons,

1471
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:36,280
but incorporating new neurons

1472
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,690
into existing brain circuitry
is actually very challenging

1473
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,693
for the brain to do.

1474
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,030
I make sure that after that workout,

1475
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,250
I get this one hour or so of
exercise five days per week

1476
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,930
because of the ways that it
supports my general health.

1477
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,370
And there are now hundreds of
studies supporting the fact

1478
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:58,040
that both endurance work
and strength training

1479
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,380
or hypertrophy training
done in combination,

1480
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,370
meaning not necessarily
in the same workout,

1481
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:07,080
but done across the week
is immensely beneficial

1482
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,160
for the production of things

1483
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,250
like brain-derived neurotrophic factor,

1484
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:14,370
for limiting inflammatory
cytokines like IL-6,

1485
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,700
for promoting anti-inflammatory
cytokines like IL-10,

1486
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,900
provided that exercise
is of the proper duration

1487
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,160
and that it's not so intense

1488
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,070
that you're actually creating damage

1489
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,990
to the various systems of the body.

1490
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:29,883
Now, where is the
threshold between optimal,

1491
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,487
sub-threshold and detrimental?

1492
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,060
This is a complicated theme

1493
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,700
if we don't put some structure around it.

1494
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,070
So let's put a little bit
of structure around it.

1495
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,090
We already said that about 60 minutes,

1496
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,990
so 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes,

1497
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:47,053
is going to be optimal for
all these health benefits.

1498
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,010
What about the structure
of the actual workouts?

1499
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:53,393
Well, we need to address
this issue of intensity.

1500
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:56,980
A good rule of thumb
based on the literature,

1501
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,100
and I discussed this with
Dr. Andy Galpin prior

1502
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,520
to this strength and hypertrophy
and endurance episodes,

1503
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,520
and the literature that's published in

1504
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,300
quality, peer-reviewed
journals really points

1505
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,710
to the fact that approximately 80%

1506
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,570
of the resistance training you do

1507
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,870
should be resistance training

1508
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,570
that doesn't go to what they call failure,

1509
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:18,040
where you can't actually
move the resistance anymore.

1510
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,740
The other 20% can be
of the higher intensity

1511
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,620
to failure type training.

1512
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,563
Now, with respect to endurance work,

1513
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,230
one can build up endurance
without having to log long,

1514
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:33,610
long mileage or extensive mileage
in the pool or by running.

1515
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,950
And that's because there
are these other forms

1516
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,810
of endurance that can build up,

1517
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,960
for instance, the capillary
beds within the muscles.

1518
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,250
Building up the capillary beds

1519
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,100
within the muscles will
allow more oxygen utilization

1520
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,150
within the muscles,

1521
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,410
and thereby will increase your endurance

1522
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,243
both of the muscles,

1523
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:50,090
but also will improve brain metabolism

1524
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,150
and the way that the heart functions,

1525
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,543
so cardiovascular function.

1526
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,400
That 80/20 rule of less than failure

1527
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,790
and work to failure in the
resistance exercise regime

1528
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,070
can be transported or translated

1529
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,330
to the endurance exercise portion

1530
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,490
by focusing on that thing
that we're familiar with,

1531
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:11,070
which is the burn when we're
running hard or cycling hard,

1532
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,860
we'll experience a kind
of burning of the muscles

1533
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,030
that's associated with the lactate system.

1534
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,337
During the episode on endurance,

1535
01:01:18,337 --> 01:01:22,050
I pointed out that that
burn is not lactic acid.

1536
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:25,590
Contrary to common belief,
it is not lactic acid.

1537
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,660
It's associated with lactate metabolism.

1538
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,130
And again, about 80% of the endurance work

1539
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:34,050
should not incorporate
that so-called "burn,"

1540
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,690
but if 20% of that work or so,

1541
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,170
I should say approximately
20% of that work,

1542
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,157
does include the so-called
"burning sensation,"

1543
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,480
that burning sensation actually
triggers the activation

1544
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,890
of release of certain compounds
and molecules from glia,

1545
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,910
this brain cell type that
supports neuron health.

1546
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:57,500
And actually, the lactate
system is its own form of fuel

1547
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,460
for the brain.

1548
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:03,460
And so there's increasing
interest in generating the lactate

1549
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,500
or pushing past that lactate
threshold for small portion,

1550
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,770
20% or so, of endurance work in order

1551
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,590
to support brain health and function.

1552
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,140
So what does all this all
look like as a protocol?

1553
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,700
Well, as I mentioned
before, this 3:2 ratio.

1554
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,250
So maybe you spend 10 weeks or so

1555
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,500
or 12 weeks or so focusing
mainly on endurance,

1556
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,820
where three workouts per
week on endurance work,

1557
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,890
80% of those workouts,

1558
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,070
meaning 80% of the time you're
below that burn threshold,

1559
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:32,140
you are not experiencing
a burning sensation,

1560
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,880
but that for 20% of it, you are.

1561
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,250
That, based on the scientific data,

1562
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,900
should support lactate metabolism,
brain health, et cetera,

1563
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,420
as well as cardiovascular
health and oxygen utilization.

1564
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,580
All the forms of endurance
that we're aware of.

1565
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,100
And then the other two workouts

1566
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,690
would involve resistance training,

1567
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,920
again, with this 80/20 split,

1568
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,470
where 80% of the work is
not to failure and 20% is.

1569
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,030
And then maybe after 10,
12 weeks, you switch,

1570
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,870
where you start emphasizing
strength and hypertrophy work

1571
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:00,900
for three of the workouts

1572
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,740
and endurance work for
two of the workouts.

1573
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,160
Now, of course, some of you will be able

1574
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,680
to train six days a week
or you'll compulsively need

1575
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,730
to train seven days a week.

1576
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,053
If you decide to do that,

1577
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,990
please be aware that
this cortisol threshold

1578
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,823
is a real thing.

1579
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,860
So for me, the 3:2 ratio
works out perfectly

1580
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,630
'cause I like two full days off a week.

1581
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,940
When I take those really depends

1582
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,260
on my schedule and how I'm feeling.

1583
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,480
Sometimes it's two days in a row.

1584
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,520
Sometimes they're interspersed
throughout the week.

1585
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,670
But in reviewing the scientific literature

1586
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,620
for those two episodes of the podcast

1587
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,610
and in talking to people
who are really informed

1588
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,290
in the world of resistance training

1589
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,220
and endurance training

1590
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,070
and how that relates to
brain health and body health,

1591
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,520
this seems to be the most
rational and grounded protocol,

1592
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,020
so that's the one that I follow.

1593
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,890
So on any given day,

1594
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:47,110
I finish that work block and I train.

1595
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,430
I do some sort of resistance
or endurance training.

1596
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,980
I put those on alternate days
or different days, rather.

1597
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,510
So we've now talked about the arc

1598
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,090
that spans all the way from waking

1599
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:00,940
to a morning about of focused work

1600
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,333
to physical training.

1601
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,870
I have not mentioned ingesting
anything or nutrients.

1602
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,210
One of the most common questions I get

1603
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,260
are what should I eat for my brain?

1604
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,270
Well, ironically enough,

1605
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,210
one of the best things you can do

1606
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,800
for your brain is to not eat,

1607
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,020
but, of course, we all
have to eat sooner or later

1608
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,200
and eating is wonderful.

1609
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,500
I absolutely love eating.

1610
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,160
I even enjoy the mere act of chewing.

1611
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,300
But the question of what
to eat is an important one

1612
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,520
as it relates to brain
health and brain function.

1613
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,010
Before we talk about that,

1614
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,670
I want to emphasize that
training fasted actually

1615
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,110
has some immediate and long-term benefits.

1616
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:39,090
Prior to having my lab at Stanford,

1617
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,710
I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego

1618
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:42,670
and had an appointment

1619
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,020
at the Salk Institute
of Biological Studies.

1620
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,220
I had a colleague there by
the name of Satchin Panda.

1621
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,710
He wrote a wonderful book
called "The Circadian Code."

1622
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:53,980
He runs a serious biology
laboratory focusing on metabolism,

1623
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,320
circadian rhythms, and so forth,

1624
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,383
as well as the effects of fasting.

1625
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:02,760
Satchin and his book "The
Circadian Code" describe

1626
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,410
how engaging in physical exercise

1627
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:08,700
while fasted can amplify the
effects of that exercise,

1628
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,560
not just for sake of increasing
the percentage of things

1629
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,880
like body fat burned, et
cetera, but for cellular health,

1630
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,860
liver health, and the
health of other organs.

1631
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,830
So where possible, I do
strive to do my workout

1632
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,870
without eating anything first.

1633
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,110
However, some days I'm very, very hungry,

1634
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:31,900
and so I do ingest water,
which contains electrolytes,

1635
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,140
so that means sodium,
magnesium, potassium,

1636
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,840
for the simple reason
that sodium, magnesium,

1637
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,860
potassium are required for
neurons to function properly.

1638
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,903
It's part of the way they
generate electrical activity.

1639
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,190
As well, Ingesting electrolytes
for me can quell hunger.

1640
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:51,270
And this points to a whole other topic

1641
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,180
we could do another
episode on at some point,

1642
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,070
which is many times people will think

1643
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,380
that their blood sugar is low

1644
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,423
and actually that's not the case.

1645
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,420
And frankly, one wouldn't want
their blood sugar to be high.

1646
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,240
You don't want your blood sugar too low,

1647
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,070
but you also don't want it too high.

1648
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,220
Very low blood sugar is terrible,

1649
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,820
but lowish blood sugar tends

1650
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,240
to give us a sense of
mental clarity and focus,

1651
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,560
related to this adrenaline phenomenon

1652
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,330
that we talked about earlier.

1653
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,590
In order to be able to focus on exercise

1654
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:21,900
or work or anything else, you
need sufficient electrolytes.

1655
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,130
And so many people find that

1656
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,170
if they simply ingest
some water with salt,

1657
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,500
maybe a 99-milligram potassium tablet,

1658
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,800
all of a sudden they
feel very mentally clear

1659
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,700
and able to do physical
work and mental work.

1660
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,390
So what I do is, prior
to this morning exercise,

1661
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:40,900
although it's now late morning
in this way I'm describing it

1662
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,970
and typically it does occur late morning,

1663
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,100
I'll have some water with

1664
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,910
either maybe half a teaspoon of sea salt

1665
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:50,600
with a 99-milligram potassium tablet

1666
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,667
or these days I'm fond of
taking what's called "LMNT."

1667
01:06:53,667 --> 01:06:54,570
L-M-N-T. LMNT.

1668
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:56,700
I learned about this from
Lex Friedman's podcasts.

1669
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,170
I know many of you are familiar with Lex,

1670
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,453
has a excellent podcast,
excellent scientist.

1671
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:03,680
I don't have any business
relationship to LMNT.

1672
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,320
They're not a sponsor of the podcast,

1673
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,220
but LMNT is a product

1674
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,920
that essentially contains electrolytes:

1675
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:12,430
sodium, potassium, as
well as magnesium malate,

1676
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,250
which has been shown to offset things

1677
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,200
like delayed onset muscle soreness.

1678
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,560
That form of magnesium
doesn't make people drowsy.

1679
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,270
It's not an anxiolytic like
some other forms of magnesium.

1680
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,360
An anxiolytic is just
one that reduces anxiety.

1681
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,380
So whether or not it's LMNT

1682
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,500
or whether or not you're
just putting a little bit

1683
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,580
of salt into some water
and ingesting that prior

1684
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,490
to training, that can be
an excellent way to ensure

1685
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,433
that you're able to complete
the physical exercise,

1686
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,980
even though you haven't eaten anything.

1687
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,840
And I confess, some days
I will eat a little bit

1688
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,490
before my workout,

1689
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,640
just because I can't
seem to resist eating.

1690
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,570
I want to mention the use of stimulants

1691
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,853
before physical training.

1692
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,160
This has certain benefits
and certain drawbacks.

1693
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,580
The benefits are sometimes
it can facilitate motivation

1694
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,340
because things like caffeine can increase

1695
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,350
the release of dopamine,

1696
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,260
can increase the release of epinephrin,

1697
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,510
can reduce that adenosine
level in the bloodstream.

1698
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,160
So some people use
caffeine before training

1699
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,370
in ways that benefit them.

1700
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,530
It can also increase fat oxidation

1701
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,430
and kind of fat metabolism and
things if that's your goal.

1702
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:16,060
I'm not a particular fan
of ingesting stimulants

1703
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,359
before training because of a whole set

1704
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,709
of problems associated with
most forms of stimulants

1705
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,410
in the form of energy drinks, et cetera.

1706
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:25,790
I am not a fan of energy drinks.

1707
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:29,939
I did a decent portion
of a previous episode

1708
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,649
on food and mood on energy drinks

1709
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,019
and some of the detrimental
things they contain.

1710
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,760
Rather, I try and train simply

1711
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,350
by ingesting the caffeine
sources I mentioned before,

1712
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:43,560
guayusa, mate, some
electrolytes, some water.

1713
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,990
Occasionally I'll have an espresso

1714
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,779
or a cup of coffee before I train.

1715
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:49,679
And on rare occasions,

1716
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,479
I should emphasize rare occasions,

1717
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:54,179
if I really need help
increasing my motivation

1718
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,300
or I decide I want to push extremely hard,

1719
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,620
I will ingest something like alpha-GPC.

1720
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:01,040
Alpha-GPC supports the release

1721
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,060
of a neuromodulator called acetylcholine.

1722
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,640
So 300 milligrams of
alpha-GPC has been shown

1723
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,490
to increase physical performance,

1724
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,319
but also cognitive performance.

1725
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:11,869
Some people might not be
interested in ingesting anything

1726
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,120
to improve their physical
performance or anything at all,

1727
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,830
but they might be addressing

1728
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:18,410
how they can improve cognitive
performance and focus.

1729
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:21,370
And alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant
way to approach that.

1730
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,040
Again, definitely check with your doctor

1731
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,630
before taking anything or
stopping to take anything,

1732
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:28,470
but alpha-GPC has been
shown in various studies

1733
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,050
to improve cognitive performance.

1734
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:33,510
And in people who have
age-related cognitive decline,

1735
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:36,470
there have been some
positive benefits reported

1736
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,790
in quality, peer-reviewed journals.

1737
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:40,819
If you want to explore those references,

1738
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:42,309
please go to examine.com,

1739
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,189
go please put in alpha-GPC,

1740
01:09:44,189 --> 01:09:45,689
go to the Human Effect Matrix,

1741
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:48,729
and there you can find
details of those studies,

1742
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:50,649
references to PubMed, et cetera.

1743
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:53,009
So let's talk about food timing first.

1744
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,070
As I mentioned, I eat
my first meal sometime

1745
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,610
around noon plus or minus an hour

1746
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,210
for the reasons we've discussed.

1747
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,813
The volume of food is also important.

1748
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,530
If you eat a large volume of anything,

1749
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,320
because it diverts blood to your gut,

1750
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,820
you will feel lethargic

1751
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,600
and you will have less
blood going to your brain.

1752
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,430
That seems like a simple and trivial fact,

1753
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,530
but if you want be able to think,

1754
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:20,850
you can't ingest large volumes
of anything into your gut.

1755
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,870
So the discussion about
what foods give you energy

1756
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:26,530
is kind of moot if you eat
enormous volumes of that food.

1757
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:28,806
Now, the volumes are
going to depend on you

1758
01:10:28,806 --> 01:10:31,830
and your needs and your activity levels.

1759
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:36,310
I'm going to discuss what I
do in terms of food content,

1760
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,030
but I'm not going to discuss food volume.

1761
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,870
I sort of know where that mostly full,

1762
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,700
like 80% full line is,

1763
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,140
and I usually eat a little
bit past that, frankly.

1764
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,990
And I'm able to maintain a decent degree

1765
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,480
of alertness into the afternoon.

1766
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,313
And that's my goal

1767
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:51,830
and I think that's the
goal of most people,

1768
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,670
to not work out in the
morning or do some work,

1769
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:57,300
and then just collapse into a slumber

1770
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,370
that lasts all afternoon,

1771
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,750
but to be able to generate alert, calm,

1772
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,070
focus states throughout the day.

1773
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:08,330
So for lunch, I do emphasize
slightly lower carbohydrate

1774
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,620
or low carbohydrate intake
for the simple reason

1775
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,500
that adrenaline and dopamine

1776
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,310
and their associated
neuromodulators are going

1777
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,000
to support alertness.

1778
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,780
So for me, I fast up until about noon.

1779
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,980
Then I eat a lunch that consists

1780
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,680
of some sort of protein thing,

1781
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,840
like some meat or some
chicken or some salmon

1782
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,760
and some vegetables, et cetera.

1783
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,730
And if I've exercised previously,

1784
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:37,180
which I do, as I mentioned,
five days a week,

1785
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:39,090
then I will ingest some starches.

1786
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,700
I'll in just some red
or, bread, excuse me,

1787
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,050
or rice or oatmeal and butter
and nuts and things like that.

1788
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:49,380
I will consume the various
food groups, as they say,

1789
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,400
but I will keep the total amount

1790
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,150
of carbohydrate a little
bit on the low side,

1791
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,170
or if I haven't trained,

1792
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,010
I won't have any carbohydrate at all.

1793
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:59,710
Not because I'm ketogenic,

1794
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,670
not because I'm inter carbohydrate,

1795
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:04,640
not because I'm on a pure
carnivore diet, far from it,

1796
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,640
but because starches cause
the release of serotonin

1797
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:13,020
in the brain and lend themselves
to a state of sleepiness.

1798
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,880
Now, I should mention that
about 25% of individuals

1799
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,420
have genes that encode for enzymes

1800
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,210
that allow them to eat large
amounts of carbohydrate

1801
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,270
and not suffer from this lethargy,

1802
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,530
this kind of sedation from carbohydrates.

1803
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:31,210
But I don't have that gene, and so for me,

1804
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:35,530
eating a noonish meal
that is not enormous,

1805
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:38,810
but is decent in size, but
that is mainly protein,

1806
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:41,150
healthy fats, and lowish carbohydrates

1807
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,310
or no carbohydrates is what allows me

1808
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:45,620
to achieve heightened states of alertness

1809
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,840
throughout the day, which is
what I need for my purposes.

1810
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,340
So just knowing that meats
and nuts support alertness,

1811
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,010
provided you don't eat too much of them,

1812
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,920
that vegetables are healthy for us

1813
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,410
and therefore we should eat them,

1814
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,900
and I happen to like them as well,

1815
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,120
and that carbohydrates tend
to have a kind of sedative

1816
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,120
like quality to them,

1817
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,320
that should help you and
guide your food choices

1818
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,000
in an intelligent way that's grounded

1819
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,900
in the scientific literature
as it relates to alertness.

1820
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,940
Now, what about components of foods

1821
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,540
that are not about alertness,

1822
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,510
but are about mood?

1823
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,860
We did an entire episode on mood and food,

1824
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:23,500
and it's very clear, based
on now dozens of studies,

1825
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:28,500
that ingesting sufficient
levels of omega-3 fatty acids

1826
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,930
is going to support healthy mood

1827
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:33,850
and even can act as an antidepressant.

1828
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:35,930
More than a dozen studies have shown

1829
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,240
that ingesting at least
1,000 milligrams per day

1830
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,720
of the EPA form of essential fatty acid

1831
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,560
is as effective as
prescription antidepressants

1832
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,240
in relieving depression.

1833
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,140
And if you're somebody

1834
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,550
who requires prescription antidepressants,

1835
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,430
Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera,

1836
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:56,990
it can allow people to take lower doses

1837
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:58,010
of those medications,

1838
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,680
which in many cases is a positive thing

1839
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,250
or a good thing to do because
of the side effect profiles

1840
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,920
that many of those drugs carry.

1841
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,390
So I find these data
remarkably compelling.

1842
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:12,690
I mean, here we have a food
or a substance from food

1843
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:15,770
that can improve our mood
and our sense of wellbeing,

1844
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:17,640
and it does that by way

1845
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,650
of increasing certain
neuromodulators in the brain,

1846
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:20,800
in particular dopamine,

1847
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,023
but also some other
related neuromodulators.

1848
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,490
So if you're eating
fatty salmon regularly,

1849
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:28,870
if you're eating krill regularly,

1850
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:31,590
meaning if you're a whale,

1851
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:35,100
if you're ingesting foods that tend

1852
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,270
to have a lot of omega-3s,

1853
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:39,030
you probably don't need to
supplement with omega-3.

1854
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:41,210
Most people are not
ingesting sufficient levels

1855
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,910
of omega-3, and I'm certainly
one of those people.

1856
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:47,110
Despite an effort to eat
good foods and whole foods,

1857
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:49,150
et cetera, and unprocessed foods,

1858
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:51,500
I've made the choice to ingest

1859
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,820
at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA.

1860
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,130
I do that in the form of fish oil

1861
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:57,639
and the EPA-DHA combination fish oil,

1862
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:00,200
but the threshold of 1,000 milligrams

1863
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,300
is not 1,000 milligrams of fish oil;

1864
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,710
it's 1,000 milligrams of EPA.

1865
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,530
Now, for those of you that
don't want to consume fish oils

1866
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:11,110
and prefer to get your omega-3s
from non-animal sources,

1867
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,540
there are non-animal sources,

1868
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,030
various forms of algae, et cetera.

1869
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,850
You can just look that up online

1870
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,060
and you should be able to find that.

1871
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,510
There are also a number of foods

1872
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,690
that include these essential omega-3s.

1873
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,290
We did an episode on food and mood

1874
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,670
where I go into more detail

1875
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,560
than you could ever want on that,

1876
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,490
as well as some additional
recommendations.

1877
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,620
We also did an episode
on thyroid function,

1878
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,030
this hormone that's
important for metabolism,

1879
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,210
and that pointed to the importance

1880
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:37,730
of getting sufficient iodine,

1881
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:39,240
which you should naturally get

1882
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,570
from the salts you're ingesting,

1883
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,270
provided you're ingesting enough salt.

1884
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,270
I'm not somebody who eats a lot of kelp,

1885
01:15:45,753 --> 01:15:48,420
but, or seaweed, although I
don't mind the taste of seaweed,

1886
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,040
I don't ingest it regularly,

1887
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,370
but ingesting sufficient selenium

1888
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:55,120
or selenium has been shown to be important

1889
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,340
for proper thyroid production
and thyroid function,

1890
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,180
which is why I tend to eat
a few Brazil nuts each day

1891
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,760
typically with my lunch or
sometimes before my workout.

1892
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,010
It doesn't really matter.

1893
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,330
The point is that the volume, the amount,

1894
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:13,380
the content, and indeed the
ratios of protein to fat

1895
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,960
to carbohydrates are going
to impact how you feel

1896
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,300
and they're going to
impact your brain health.

1897
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,630
And, of course, the timing.

1898
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:22,300
We know that allowing periods of 12 hours

1899
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,670
or more each 24-hour cycle

1900
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,690
where you're not ingesting
anything is beneficial

1901
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:26,720
for your brain and body health.

1902
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,170
That's what Satchin Panda

1903
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:31,460
and his colleagues' work has
shown over and over again

1904
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,070
in these quality studies.

1905
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:34,807
So when people ask me, you know,

1906
01:16:34,807 --> 01:16:37,010
"What should I eat for my brain?"

1907
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,440
More often than not,

1908
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,190
it's really a question of how
you're structuring your day,

1909
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:42,700
when you're eating for the first time,

1910
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,990
how long you're allowing yourself

1911
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:45,893
to fast each 24-hour cycle,

1912
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:50,440
and also whether or not you're
getting sufficient omega-3s,

1913
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,950
whether or not you're
getting sufficient selenium

1914
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:55,470
to support things like thyroid function,

1915
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:58,680
which has an impact both on
the metabolism of the body,

1916
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,450
but also the metabolism in the brain.

1917
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,750
And when I say metabolism,

1918
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,340
I don't just mean burning energy;

1919
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,480
I actually mean the rebuilding of things.

1920
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,410
So in the episode on growth
hormone and thyroid hormone,

1921
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,950
we talked about how metabolism means,

1922
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:15,010
not just the breakdown of
fats and carbohydrates,

1923
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,360
but also the building up,
the repair of muscle tissue,

1924
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,507
the repair of bone,
the reinforcing of bone

1925
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:23,950
and the repair and the
buildup of brain tissue.

1926
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:26,270
And so those are the
things that I emphasize

1927
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,120
because they are so strongly supported

1928
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:32,220
by the scientific data
done in mice studies,

1929
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,630
done in humans.

1930
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:37,410
And basically there's a
lot of biochemical evidence

1931
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:39,640
that supports everything
that I just described.

1932
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,240
Along the lines of health and wellbeing,

1933
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,130
I'd be remiss if I
didn't mention hormones.

1934
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:48,370
Hormones have broad effects
on the body and brain.

1935
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,330
We did an entire month on hormones

1936
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,780
if you want to hear about any
of those hormones in detail.

1937
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,150
We talked about testosterone
and optimizing testosterone,

1938
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,363
estrogen, et cetera.

1939
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,100
The sex steroid hormones,

1940
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,550
which include testosterone and estrogen,

1941
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,540
which, of course, are
present in varying ratios,

1942
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:09,930
but in both men and women and in kids,

1943
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,540
they are manufactured from cholesterol.

1944
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,400
We hear about cholesterol
as this terrible thing,

1945
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,200
but they are actually
made from cholesterol.

1946
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,860
And so if you don't get
sufficient levels of cholesterol,

1947
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,337
that can be problematic for your hormones

1948
01:18:21,337 --> 01:18:23,717
and that can be problematic for your brain

1949
01:18:23,717 --> 01:18:25,560
and your body health.

1950
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,390
So without going into too much detail,

1951
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:29,930
I'll just point to a couple of things

1952
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:33,340
that I do that, at
least from my blood work

1953
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,780
and from my subjective experience,

1954
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,180
have been very beneficial for me

1955
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,080
that some of you might want to consider.

1956
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,840
First of all, I am not shy
about my love for butter.

1957
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,870
I will eat packs of butter directly.

1958
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:46,170
I believe if people
are going to eat cheese

1959
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,890
without a cracker, I will
eat butter without a cracker.

1960
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,960
Butter is high in cholesterol,

1961
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,100
so I don't eat a ton of it,

1962
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,253
but at least for me and for
my lipid profiles, it's fine.

1963
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,530
Butter has cholesterol,

1964
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,660
which is a precursor to
the sex steroid hormones,

1965
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:03,360
and men and women need
testosterone and estrogen

1966
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,730
in order to feel good
and to be able to think.

1967
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,210
You do not want your estrogen too low

1968
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,840
or your testosterone too low.

1969
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,890
So I eat butter in order to ensure

1970
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,150
that I get sufficient cholesterol.

1971
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,970
Butter also has some other
things that are beneficial,

1972
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:18,190
various small fatty acids that are

1973
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:20,790
that are interesting in
terms of their effects

1974
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,800
on metabolism, et cetera.

1975
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,920
You can look those up, benefits of butter.

1976
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,460
But again, volume is important
and you can't overdo it.

1977
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,610
Costello incidentally
loves butter as well.

1978
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,420
Along the lines of
hormones and testosterone,

1979
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,240
I get a lot of questions
about this I think

1980
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,100
because a lot of online communities

1981
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,890
are sort of obsessed with testosterone,

1982
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:43,570
and I just want to emphasize that, yes,

1983
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,070
having sufficient levels of testosterone

1984
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,410
is vitally important for brain function

1985
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,970
and having sufficient levels

1986
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:53,150
of estrogen will allow your
brain to actually function.

1987
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:56,390
It turns out that estrogen
is one of the main ways

1988
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:59,470
in which the brain maintains longevity

1989
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:01,590
and maintains its ability to think.

1990
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:04,840
So we should all be seeking
optimal testosterone levels

1991
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,290
for ourselves, both
testosterone and estrogen.

1992
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:11,470
And many of the things that
we've discussed up until now,

1993
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,490
morning sunlight, exercise, fasting,

1994
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,670
those can support
testosterone and estrogen

1995
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:21,740
in meaningful and positive ways.

1996
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:24,480
I get a lot of questions
about hormone optimization.

1997
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,810
We did an entire month on this topic.

1998
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,300
We did an entire episode on testosterone

1999
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,460
and estrogen optimization.

2000
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,240
I just want to briefly
highlight two things

2001
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,620
that could be relevant,

2002
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,820
and then if you want more details,

2003
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:37,980
please go see that episode.

2004
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,740
The first is that testosterone

2005
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:43,030
can exert its various functions only

2006
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:46,460
in its unbound form, free testosterone.

2007
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:49,500
We all make a particular binding protein

2008
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,890
called "sex hormone binding globulin"

2009
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,720
that essentially binds up testosterone,

2010
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,360
prevents it from being free.

2011
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,490
This sounds like a terrible thing,

2012
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:57,340
but actually it's a good thing

2013
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,102
because it allows
testosterone be transported

2014
01:20:59,102 --> 01:21:01,340
to the various tissues,
including the brain,

2015
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,003
where it can exert its various functions.

2016
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,620
For those that have lower

2017
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:10,470
than desired levels of testosterone

2018
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,930
or too much sex hormone binding globulin,

2019
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:15,150
it turns out that 400 milligrams per day

2020
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,930
of something called "tongkat ali,"

2021
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:18,010
which is a form of ginseng,

2022
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:21,170
can actually help increase
levels of free testosterone.

2023
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,757
Many people experience a
positive subjective effect

2024
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:26,230
and some objective affects as well,

2025
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,200
meaning increases in free testosterone

2026
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,020
when they do blood analysis.

2027
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,160
There are some data on that,

2028
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,100
not a ton in the
peer-reviewed literatures,

2029
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,830
and again, always approach
these with a sense of caution

2030
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:39,920
and definitely talked to your doctor.

2031
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,130
If you want to learn more about that,

2032
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,470
you can go to examine.com.

2033
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:45,100
There's a lot of information
there listed about that.

2034
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,210
The other compound that's
relevant both to men and women,

2035
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,360
or I should say people that are trying

2036
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,663
to optimize testosterone
and/or estrogen, is Fadogia.

2037
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:56,090
Fadogia agrestis is actually an herb

2038
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,390
that increases the levels

2039
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,760
of what's called "luteinizing hormone."

2040
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,990
Luteinizing hormone is a hormone

2041
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,590
that's released from the hypothalamus

2042
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:06,270
within the brain that
travels to the gonads,

2043
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:08,030
either the ovaries or the testes,

2044
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:12,400
to stimulate the release of
estrogen or testosterone.

2045
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,970
And Fadogia agrestis has been shown,

2046
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,550
albeit in a limited number of studies,

2047
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,310
to increase levels of luteinizing hormone

2048
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,310
and thereby levels of
testosterone and estrogen

2049
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,030
in ways that some people find beneficial.

2050
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:24,200
So I just want to mention those two.

2051
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,950
And again, if you want
a lot more information

2052
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,760
about hormone optimization,

2053
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,263
please see the episodes
on hormone optimization.

2054
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,600
A key aspect to the mid-day meal,

2055
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,010
if you want that meal to benefit you,

2056
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:39,540
is to take a brief walk afterwards.

2057
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,410
It turns out that brief
walks of five to 30 minutes

2058
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:45,340
after ingesting food can
accelerate metabolism

2059
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,160
and actually can accelerate

2060
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,400
and improve nutrient utilization,

2061
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,110
which is essentially
the same as metabolism.

2062
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:53,890
But nonetheless, that's
something that I do

2063
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,840
after I finish my noon meal.

2064
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,710
I do force myself to
stand up and go outside

2065
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:00,670
and take a brief walk.

2066
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,640
That also gets me, again, into optic flow.

2067
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,860
It also has another benefit,

2068
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,300
which is that I am giving my brain

2069
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,360
and thereby my body more information

2070
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,590
about light and time of day,

2071
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,790
which is always better
than less information

2072
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:14,253
about light and time of day.

2073
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,960
Much of our circadian rhythm
and our health rhythms

2074
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:20,538
and all of our cognitive
rhythms, et cetera,

2075
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:25,120
are supported by our cells
knowing where they are in time,

2076
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,200
and light is the primary zeitgeber,

2077
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,230
that's German for "timekeeper,"

2078
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:34,020
is the primary way in which
the body learns information

2079
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,417
or about what function should be turned on

2080
01:23:36,417 --> 01:23:38,260
and what functions should be turned off.

2081
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,560
So getting that morning light pulse,

2082
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,010
but then also leaving the house

2083
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,910
or apartment or workplace and getting out

2084
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,640
for a few minutes after lunch
is beneficial for metabolism,

2085
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,760
beneficial for nutrient utilization,

2086
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,510
and beneficial for all the
organs and tissues of the body

2087
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:54,270
because you're getting that
outside light exposure.

2088
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,540
Now I'd like to shift our attention

2089
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,950
towards science supported-protocols

2090
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,170
that increase the effectiveness

2091
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,500
and our performance in everything.

2092
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,350
And by everything I mean sleep,

2093
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:08,180
I mean physical performance,
I mean mental performance,

2094
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:10,920
I mean less anxiety, all the things.

2095
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,790
Truly all the things.

2096
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:17,020
And that is something called
"non-sleep deep rest."

2097
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:21,410
Non-sleep deep rest or NSDR
is an acronym that I coined

2098
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:25,800
as an umbrella term to
encompass many protocols

2099
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,130
that all have been shown,
in one form or another,

2100
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:32,350
to support better brain and body function.

2101
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,940
Now, these protocols have
names that you've heard before.

2102
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:38,490
Things like meditation,
things like yoga nidra,

2103
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,290
and things like hypnosis.

2104
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:44,200
All of these protocols and
these activities, however,

2105
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,410
share something in common,

2106
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:48,870
which is they involve a deliberate

2107
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:51,760
and directed shift in one's state,

2108
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,520
and the shift tends to be

2109
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,193
toward a state of deeper relaxation.

2110
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:58,570
We certainly don't have time now

2111
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:01,050
to dissect out the
literature on all of these.

2112
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,850
There is ample literature,

2113
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:05,510
I should say there is
robust and ample literature,

2114
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,620
supporting the fact that

2115
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:09,250
a regular meditation
practice is beneficial.

2116
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,990
But meditation itself has many forms:

2117
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:14,430
transcendental meditation,
loving kindness meditation,

2118
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,810
third eye meditation, walking meditation.

2119
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,420
Yoga nidra is a practice I've talked

2120
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,080
about many times before,

2121
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,620
which involves simply lying down.

2122
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,650
It doesn't involve any movement.

2123
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:24,230
No down dogs or up dogs or anything.

2124
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:26,110
It just involves lying on your back

2125
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:28,470
and doing some specific
long exhale breathing.

2126
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,080
There are a lot of yoga
nidra scripts out there

2127
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,820
that are quite good.

2128
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:36,010
But there's one NSDR type protocol

2129
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:39,500
that has been shown by the greatest number

2130
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,260
of scientific studies to promote

2131
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,660
not just states of deep relaxation,

2132
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,410
not just states of heightened focus,

2133
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:49,170
but also to accelerate plasticity

2134
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:52,140
and learning within the
brain, and that's hypnosis.

2135
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,930
And I've become increasingly excited

2136
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:57,240
and interested in hypnosis as a tool,

2137
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,740
and not just a tool of any kind,

2138
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,630
but a tool that really can be directed

2139
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,810
toward particular goals and outcomes.

2140
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:06,340
And I think that's really
what sets hypnosis apart

2141
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:08,940
as an NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, protocol

2142
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:12,130
from things like naps or
things like yoga nidra

2143
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,010
or things like meditation.

2144
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:16,430
And I certainly believe and understand

2145
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,660
that meditation naps and
yoga nidra can be directed

2146
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,780
toward less anxiety, et cetera,

2147
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:25,210
but hypnosis is unique in

2148
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:27,860
that it's very directed.

2149
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,950
The essence of hypnosis
is for the person, you,

2150
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:35,060
to guide your brain toward a
particular outcome or change.

2151
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,970
So I'd like to point out
a particular resource.

2152
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:39,220
It's a completely zero-cost resource,

2153
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,760
which is reveri.com.

2154
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,470
That's R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

2155
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,620
reveri.com obviously is a website

2156
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,930
where there are links to
an app that's available

2157
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,310
in Apple and Android.

2158
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:51,660
This is a hypnosis app,

2159
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,250
but this isn't just any hypnosis app.

2160
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,770
This is a hypnosis app

2161
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:58,200
that contains multiple hypnosis protocols

2162
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,090
that are all backed by
very high-quality science.

2163
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,947
The science was done by my colleague

2164
01:27:02,947 --> 01:27:04,750
and our associate chair of psychiatry

2165
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,960
at Stanford School of Medicine,

2166
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,510
that David Spiegel is
responsible for that work.

2167
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,763
I'm not associated with
that scientific work.

2168
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:14,480
They've examined what brain areas

2169
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,300
get activated during hypnosis,

2170
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,560
what the outcomes are for
various hypnosis protocols.

2171
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,393
And within Reveri,

2172
01:27:20,393 --> 01:27:23,340
you will find hypnosis protocols
for enhancing your focus,

2173
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,940
enhancing creativity, reducing pain,

2174
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,650
getting better at
sleeping, reducing anxiety.

2175
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:31,700
Most of these are about
10 or 15 minutes long.

2176
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,240
Some of them are extremely brief.

2177
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,110
One minute long.

2178
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:36,630
They have a one-minute
hypnosis that you can do.

2179
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:38,940
Those one minute hypnosis
scripts work best

2180
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,167
if you've been doing the 10

2181
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:43,960
and 15 minute ones
regularly or semi-regularly.

2182
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,600
It's a really wonderful resource

2183
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,023
for which there is a lot of
peer-reviewed published data.

2184
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,640
One study I'd like to emphasize

2185
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,550
in particular is Jiang et al.

2186
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:55,400
J-I-A-N-G.

2187
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,550
That is a reference you can find

2188
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:00,640
on the reveri.com website
under Our Research.

2189
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,640
And the title of this
paper is "Brain Activity

2190
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,840
and Functional Connectivity
Associated with Hypnosis,"

2191
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,970
and it was published in the
journal Cerebral Cortex.

2192
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:12,320
What this paper essentially
shows is that specific areas

2193
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,880
of our brain that are involved
in executive function,

2194
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,860
which is associated with
our ability to focus,

2195
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:19,450
as well as what's called
the "default mode network,"

2196
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,340
which is sort of the way
that your brain idles,

2197
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:22,970
does your brain tend to idle

2198
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:26,820
at a level of high anxiety or calm,

2199
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:28,130
as well as activation of

2200
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,860
a brain area called the "insula."

2201
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,420
That's I-N-S-U-L-A.

2202
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,290
The insula is extremely interesting.

2203
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:35,920
Hypnosis has been shown
to activate the insula,

2204
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,410
which can enhance our
sense of interoception,

2205
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,370
our sense of internal state,

2206
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:42,290
which might sound like a annoying thing.

2207
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:44,520
You don't want to be
thinking about your heartbeat

2208
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,510
or your breathing.

2209
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:48,060
But what's really
interesting about hypnosis is

2210
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,523
that it increases areas of the brain

2211
01:28:49,523 --> 01:28:52,810
that are responsible for
deep relaxation, focus,

2212
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:56,800
and self-awareness, this
interoception, simultaneously.

2213
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,220
And that's very unusual
compared to other states,

2214
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:02,240
any other states of any kind.

2215
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,530
So I've made it a practice,
a daily practice in fact,

2216
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:08,020
that after lunch and after this walk,

2217
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:11,000
I do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script

2218
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
because what I've found is
that in contrast to naps

2219
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,260
and in contrast to other forms of NSDR,

2220
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:20,520
it really allows me to enter
a state of deep relaxation,

2221
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,250
but also to then exit that state

2222
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,050
in a very focused and deliberate way

2223
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:28,090
that allows me to lean into
my afternoon in an alert way,

2224
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:30,990
in a way that I can
function and do mental work

2225
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:33,440
and interact with people, et cetera.

2226
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,930
So there's no brain fog,
there's no grogginess.

2227
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:37,630
And I want to emphasize that the hypnosis

2228
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:39,210
that I'm referring to here

2229
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:43,190
and that Reveri provides
is not stage hypnosis.

2230
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:45,295
This isn't you being programmed
to squawk like a chicken

2231
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:46,840
or do anything against your will.

2232
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,050
This is you teaching your brain
how to access these focused,

2233
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,530
relaxed, interoceptive states.

2234
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:56,090
This is also an extremely
valuable aspect to hypnosis

2235
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,790
because it can increase plasticity,

2236
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:01,170
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

2237
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,980
It's essentially opening
up pathways that allow you

2238
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:06,520
to change your brain in
the ways that you want.

2239
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,920
And it's very directed
toward particular outcomes

2240
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,180
So I am an, as you can probably tell,

2241
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,410
I'm very enthusiastic about hypnosis

2242
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,520
as an optimal NSDR protocol,

2243
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,510
and so I do that every single day.

2244
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:21,310
There are days that I
don't manage to do it

2245
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:22,260
for whatever reason.

2246
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,580
I forget or interference
from email or et cetera.

2247
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:28,760
But that is essentially how
I enter my early afternoon.

2248
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,590
I do this post-lunch, post-walk NSDR

2249
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:35,580
in the form of a Reveri hypnosis.

2250
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:39,490
Again, a completely
zero-cost resource to you.

2251
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:40,980
There are excellent data.

2252
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:43,860
All those data can be
found on the Reveri site,

2253
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,980
and you can also learn a
lot more about hypnosis

2254
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:48,080
and what sorts of hypnosis protocols

2255
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,660
might be optimal for you.

2256
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:52,840
So if you are looking for a
science-backed, zero-cost,

2257
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:56,150
very effective tool for
getting better at focusing,

2258
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,300
better at sleeping,
better at all the things

2259
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,150
that I believe people want,

2260
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:01,910
I do believe that is the best tool

2261
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:04,030
that one can access at this point in time.

2262
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:06,880
So then after I exit hypnosis,

2263
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,170
I usually give Costello a
little scratch behind the ear,

2264
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:11,083
and then I make sure that I hydrate.

2265
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,840
Hydration, again, is vitally
important for brain function.

2266
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,150
It's vitally important
for all bodily functions.

2267
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,760
And I often forget to do it,

2268
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,260
so I've just sort of linked
the drinking of water

2269
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:25,020
to my hypnosis practice.

2270
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,730
As soon as I'm done, I hydrate.

2271
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:30,490
And then I tend to focus
on another work about.

2272
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,220
So this would be, for
me, sometime around 2:30

2273
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,650
or 3:00 in the afternoon

2274
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:37,550
when normally I would be
quite sleepy and passing out.

2275
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:41,120
However, the protocol of
shifting my morning caffeine

2276
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,530
to 90 minutes to two hours after waking,

2277
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:46,310
as well as the use of
this hypnosis protocol

2278
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:49,070
has really allowed me to
move through the afternoon

2279
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,360
in a way that I don't
experience that dip in.

2280
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,960
Energy every once in a while
I'll feel kind of sleepy

2281
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,793
or kind of out of it,

2282
01:31:54,793 --> 01:31:59,690
but I've been really pleasantly surprised

2283
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:02,040
at the extent to which one
can avoid that afternoon dip.

2284
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,350
If you do certain things properly prior

2285
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,910
to the arrival of 2:00 or 3:00 PM.

2286
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,923
Now, if you're a napper and
you want to nap, no big deal.

2287
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:12,790
Naps can be wonderfully beneficial.

2288
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,350
Here are the rules around napping

2289
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,580
according to the sleep science.

2290
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,150
Stanford has an excellent sleep clinic.

2291
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:19,170
I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer,

2292
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:22,450
my colleague in the
Stanford Sleep Laboratory,

2293
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:24,660
as well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley

2294
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,690
whose name I'm sure most
of you are familiar with.

2295
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:29,060
He wrote this wonderful
book, "Why We Sleep."

2296
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:32,260
Naps should be 90 minutes or less,

2297
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,500
and 20-minute naps are fine,

2298
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,160
but not longer than 90 minutes.

2299
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,610
And there are essentially
two varieties of people:

2300
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:40,750
people for whom napping interferes

2301
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:44,990
with falling asleep later
that night and staying asleep

2302
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:47,580
and people for whom the
nap does not interfere.

2303
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,210
You have to decide who you are.

2304
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:51,700
And if you're somebody who can nap

2305
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,350
and not have any trouble falling asleep

2306
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,460
and staying asleep later that night,

2307
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,660
well, by all means, nap.

2308
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:57,890
Just make it 90 minutes or less.

2309
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:00,623
Again, these 90-minute cycles
are really a vital constraint

2310
01:33:00,623 --> 01:33:02,500
that we should all obey.

2311
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,360
If it's 91 minutes, don't worry.

2312
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,970
You won't dissolve into a puddle of tears.

2313
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:07,560
But if you're starting
to sleep for an hour

2314
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,170
or more in the afternoon,
that can be problematic.

2315
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:14,270
If you're somebody who can
nap for 10, 20 minutes,

2316
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:17,410
that's probably better than
getting a full 90-minute cycle,

2317
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,980
unless you didn't get enough
sleep the night before.

2318
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,830
But you really have to figure
out what's right for you.

2319
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:22,900
There's a lot of variety there.

2320
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,330
But that's essentially
what the science says.

2321
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:26,840
Now, whether or not you nap or whether

2322
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,930
or not you do not nap,

2323
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,840
a key protocol for sleep
health and wakefulness

2324
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,320
and metabolism and hormone
health is viewing light

2325
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,560
in the afternoon.

2326
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,360
So here's the reason for doing this.

2327
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:43,620
As we progress into the evening hours,

2328
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:47,200
there's a phenomenon where
our retina, our eyes,

2329
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,400
become very sensitive to light,

2330
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,600
such that if we view bright lights

2331
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,820
or even not so bright lights

2332
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:58,640
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM,

2333
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:01,020
that is strongly disruptive,

2334
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:04,880
very disruptive for our
dopamine production.

2335
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,000
It can really screw up our sleep,

2336
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,090
and it's actually been shown in data

2337
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:11,880
from David Berson's lab
at Brown University,

2338
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,590
one of the foremost circadian
biology laboratories,

2339
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:16,580
as well as Samer Hattar's laboratory

2340
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:19,270
at the National Institute of Mental Health

2341
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:22,920
that viewing bright light,
or even not so bright light,

2342
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,660
between these hours of
11:00 PM and 4:00 AM

2343
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,910
or even 10:00 PM and 4:00
AM can disrupt learning

2344
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:31,160
and memory, can disrupt the immune system

2345
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:34,193
and can disrupt mood in
very long-lasting ways.

2346
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:38,200
There are ways to offset that, however.

2347
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,210
What I call your "Netflix inoculation."

2348
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:43,410
For those of you that like
to stay up late on the tablet

2349
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:45,750
or computer or watching Netflix,

2350
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:49,130
getting a little bit of
afternoon light in your eyes,

2351
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:51,170
somewhat counter-intuitively,

2352
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:54,240
can prevent this disruption

2353
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:57,820
of bright light later in the
evening, at least somewhat.

2354
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,190
What do I mean by that?

2355
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:03,520
Well, if you view light as the
sun is starting to go down,

2356
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,130
so if you step outside
around 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM,

2357
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:08,960
again, what time exactly
will depend on time of year

2358
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,490
and where you are located on our planet,

2359
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:14,170
but as the sun starts to head down,

2360
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:16,040
you don't necessarily
have to see the sunset,

2361
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:19,350
it'd be lovely if you could,
sunsets are beautiful,

2362
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:23,270
but if you can get outside and
see the sun as it arcs down,

2363
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,750
or if you can't see the sun directly,

2364
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:28,450
get some sunlight in your
eyes in the afternoon hours,

2365
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:32,180
so maybe 4:00 PMish, and
do that for 20, 30 minutes,

2366
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:34,840
maybe reading outside or taking a walk,

2367
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,210
I walk the dog again, that's my protocol,

2368
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:38,400
in order to get that evening light,

2369
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,060
what it does is it lowers the sensitivity

2370
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,840
of your retina in the late evening hours,

2371
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,640
which allows you to buffer yourself

2372
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,770
against the negative effects
of bright light later at night.

2373
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:53,470
Now, it won't allow you to blast your eyes

2374
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:54,303
with bright light;

2375
01:35:54,303 --> 01:35:56,580
you still need to dim the
lights in the evening.

2376
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:59,000
But there's a very nice
study that was published

2377
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,210
in scientific reports that illustrates

2378
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,780
that if one does this,

2379
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:07,310
if you go outside and view
sunlight in the evening hours

2380
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:10,350
for anywhere from five to 30 minutes,

2381
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,355
and I realized that people have a range

2382
01:36:12,355 --> 01:36:14,680
of constraints on their schedule,

2383
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:18,240
but from five to 30
minutes, what happens is

2384
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,030
that your melatonin
rhythm stays appropriate.

2385
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:22,700
Now, we haven't talked
too much about melatonin,

2386
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:27,180
but melatonin is a hormone
that is inhibited by light.

2387
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:29,120
It's actually prevented by light.

2388
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,640
And melatonin is the hormone

2389
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,010
that allows you to fall asleep easily.

2390
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,300
Now, I'm not talking about
supplementing melatonin;

2391
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,110
I'm talking about melatonin

2392
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:40,590
that you naturally
produce from your pineal.

2393
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:42,690
So the protocol is very simple:

2394
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:45,090
get outside in the afternoon or evening

2395
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,150
for 10 to 30 minutes,
take your sunglasses off,

2396
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:50,890
get some bright light, get some
natural light in your eyes.

2397
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,740
If you can't do that,

2398
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,810
probably better to just stay

2399
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:57,480
with standard artificial lights inside.

2400
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,840
Don't crank them up, but
just start to dim them.

2401
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,770
Again, this would be a time
to avoid blue blockers.

2402
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,670
People are popping on blue
blockers at four o'clock

2403
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:06,830
in the afternoon 'cause you're worried

2404
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,560
that blue light is going
to disrupt your sleep.

2405
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,180
Well, you're making
your eyes more sensitive

2406
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,540
to any light that you might
see later in the evening,

2407
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:15,150
blue light or otherwise.

2408
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:16,980
So get that afternoon light.

2409
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:20,470
So what you'll probably notice
is that the optimal protocols

2410
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:23,100
for optimizing your brain and body health

2411
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,200
and performance and sleep, et cetera,

2412
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,310
are actually really simple.

2413
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:29,550
But just because they're
simple does not mean

2414
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,950
that they are not powerful;

2415
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:32,220
in fact, they are very powerful

2416
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:35,410
because they leverage the
most powerful technology

2417
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:37,520
that exists, which is your nervous system.

2418
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,370
You know, we always think
about technologies as devices,

2419
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,670
and indeed there are some
wonderful devices out there.

2420
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:44,427
Some people are really
into tracking their sleep

2421
01:37:44,427 --> 01:37:45,600
and their sleep time.

2422
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:46,470
If you're into that, great.

2423
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:48,270
That's not something that I personally do,

2424
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:51,610
although I keep telling
myself that I should do that.

2425
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,530
There are devices that
can control brainwaves

2426
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:55,363
and things of that sort.

2427
01:37:55,363 --> 01:37:58,960
But what we are talking about
today are really basic things

2428
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,997
that we can all do that
can steer our neurology

2429
01:38:01,997 --> 01:38:04,380
and our biology in the directions

2430
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,493
that are going to support workflow,

2431
01:38:06,493 --> 01:38:08,090
that are going to support hormones,

2432
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:10,520
that are going to support brain function.

2433
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:13,670
So this afternoon light
viewing is yet another example

2434
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:16,800
of leveraging a technology
that you were born with

2435
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,810
and that you will die with

2436
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:20,410
and that you will have
every day in between

2437
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:24,350
in order to tweak the
hormones of your system,

2438
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:26,120
in this case, the hormone melatonin,

2439
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,040
so that it's released
at the appropriate times

2440
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,600
and not at the wrong times.

2441
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,500
Because we know that when hormones

2442
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,820
and systems of the body are well aligned

2443
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,040
with the 24-hour schedule,

2444
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,280
beautiful things happen.

2445
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,870
And when they are misaligned,
terrible things happen.

2446
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:42,670
Sometimes those terrible
things are subtle at first,

2447
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:45,970
but disrupting your circadian
rhythms is really bad

2448
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:48,170
for every system in your body.

2449
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:50,150
Getting it right, and as you can tell,

2450
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:52,180
getting it right doesn't take much,

2451
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,060
can really serve to "optimize" you.

2452
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,000
When I say "optimize,"

2453
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,190
I mean it puts you into
a better mood overall,

2454
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:00,940
better state for learning, et cetera.

2455
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:03,110
So get that afternoon light as well.

2456
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:05,170
So at some point in the evening,

2457
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:07,460
I eat that thing that we call dinner.

2458
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:11,380
And while it feels sort of
strange to talk about my dinner,

2459
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:13,300
the reason I want to talk about my dinner

2460
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,790
and what I eat for dinner is that for me,

2461
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:18,340
dinner, of course, is about eating-

2462
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:19,750
I'll mention again I love eating-

2463
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:22,590
but also about optimizing the transition

2464
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,580
to sleep and sleep.

2465
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:27,140
So obviously I eat foods that I enjoy.

2466
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:29,430
I'm not one of these people
that will eat anything

2467
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:34,410
or avoid eating anything
simply to benefit from that.

2468
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:36,400
I do enjoy food very, very much.

2469
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,170
And so my dinner generally
is comprised of things

2470
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:43,230
that are going to support
rest and deep sleep.

2471
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:46,280
And that means starchy carbohydrates.

2472
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:49,170
It's absolutely clear
that one of the major ways

2473
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:51,000
that we can increase serotonin,

2474
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,003
which helps in the transition to sleep,

2475
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,170
is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates.

2476
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:58,500
Now, I realized that starchy
carbohydrates are kind

2477
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,500
of a demonized term nowadays
and everyone's anti-carbs,

2478
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,560
but, you know, we really
should distinguish

2479
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,260
between refined sugars
and complex carbohydrates.

2480
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,630
And we did an episode about this.

2481
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:11,150
We talked about how
refined sugars disrupt,

2482
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:12,294
not just metabolism,

2483
01:40:12,294 --> 01:40:15,640
but they actually disrupt
some of the neurons in the gut

2484
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,870
that sense fatty acids and amino acids

2485
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:19,240
from fats and proteins.

2486
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:22,240
But those same neurons can
actually respond to sugar

2487
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,110
and create a situation

2488
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,140
where you actually
start craving more sugar

2489
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:29,240
because those neurons
in your gut communicate

2490
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,017
via a nerve pathway for
you aficionados called

2491
01:40:32,017 --> 01:40:34,410
"the vagus nerve" and a little cluster

2492
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:36,180
of neurons called the "nodose ganglia."

2493
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,087
N-O-D-O-S-E.

2494
01:40:38,087 --> 01:40:41,590
Nodose ganglias are right
next to the corner of your jaw

2495
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:43,060
and can trigger the activation

2496
01:40:43,060 --> 01:40:44,570
and the release of dopamine in your brain,

2497
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:47,430
which basically makes
you crave more sugar,

2498
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,310
independent of how something tastes.

2499
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:50,450
So when I say carbohydrates,

2500
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:53,390
what I really mean is
starchy carbohydrates,

2501
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:54,790
non-refined sugars.

2502
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:59,150
And in the episode about food and mood

2503
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:00,740
and metabolism as well,

2504
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:03,030
I referenced a really spectacular lecture

2505
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:05,810
by Dr. Robert Lustig who's
a pediatric endocrinologist

2506
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:07,550
at UCSF, UC San Francisco,

2507
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:09,990
absolutely spectacular talk,

2508
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:11,690
you can find it on YouTube easily,

2509
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:14,940
where he talks about the
science of refined sugars.

2510
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:18,130
And this isn't in any kind of
conspiracy or paranoid way.

2511
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:21,200
This is really the medical
and scientific literature.

2512
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,670
So my dinner is carbohydrates
and some protein.

2513
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:26,570
So maybe some chicken or
fish or something like that,

2514
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:28,930
maybe some eggs, or sometimes just pasta

2515
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:30,840
or just rice and vegetables.

2516
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,250
And that's because I enjoy those foods,

2517
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:37,520
but also because I want to
increase the amount of serotonin

2518
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,950
in my brain so that I can
actually fall asleep that night.

2519
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:42,590
Many people who are on
low-carbohydrate diets struggle

2520
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:44,420
with falling and staying asleep,

2521
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:47,180
and that's because it's hard
to achieve heightened levels

2522
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:51,160
of serotonin which are
necessary to enter sleep.

2523
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,820
I should also mention that melatonin

2524
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:55,310
and serotonin fall in the same pathway.

2525
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:58,070
They are related hormones
and neuromodulators.

2526
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,990
We won't go into their biosynthesis now,

2527
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:03,720
but essentially what we're
talking about is a system

2528
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,240
that's biasing us towards
rest and relaxation

2529
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,250
as opposed to wakefulness.

2530
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:10,450
You might ask, "Well, can't
I just take serotonin?

2531
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:11,830
Can't I just take 5-HTP

2532
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:13,960
or a precursor to
serotonin or tryptophan?"

2533
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,170
And indeed you can, however,

2534
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:17,530
many people including myself,

2535
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:19,420
find that when they
supplement with serotonin

2536
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:20,770
in the evening or at night,

2537
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:24,210
that can cause problems
in the architecture

2538
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:26,030
or the structure of sleep.

2539
01:42:26,030 --> 01:42:27,940
It can cause a lot of
people, including me,

2540
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:29,700
to fall asleep very fast,

2541
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,440
sleep very deeply for three or four hours,

2542
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,320
and then wake up

2543
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,830
and have a terrible time
falling back asleep.

2544
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:38,590
And that effect, at least for
me, can last several days.

2545
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:39,650
It's really disruptive.

2546
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,910
So I don't like to
supplement with anything

2547
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:45,600
that is directly dopamine
or a precursor to dopamine

2548
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,110
at any time or directly serotonin

2549
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,480
or a precursor to serotonin.

2550
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,490
Rather, there are other things

2551
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:53,050
that can enhance the
transition to sleep safely,

2552
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:54,730
which we will talk about in a few minutes.

2553
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:57,620
But the evening meal consists
largely of carbohydrates

2554
01:42:57,620 --> 01:43:02,600
for that specific purpose of
generating a sense of calm.

2555
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,430
And, of course,
carbohydrates are delicious.

2556
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:07,020
And because I'm doing
some physical training

2557
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:09,170
and presumably you are as
well, or I hope you are,

2558
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:12,040
'cause it's so beneficial to one's health,

2559
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:14,800
that's also going to
replenish my glycogen stores,

2560
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,100
which is one of the primary fuel sources

2561
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:18,560
for moving one's muscles

2562
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,970
and moving around and doing exercise,

2563
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:22,660
as well as for the brain
and for cognitive function.

2564
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:26,360
So low carbohydrates
throughout the 24-hour period

2565
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,430
are not something that
are attractive to me.

2566
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:30,810
I realized that some
people will do much better

2567
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:32,960
on a low-carbohydrate
or even ketogenic diet,

2568
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:37,490
but for me, and I do
believe for most people,

2569
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:40,150
creating a situation of maybe fasting,

2570
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:42,530
and then low-carb or no-carb diets

2571
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:45,210
for states of alertness and focus

2572
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:46,700
at one portion of the day,

2573
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:49,640
and then ingesting starchy carbohydrates

2574
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,140
for sake of inducing
rest and relaxation is a

2575
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:57,350
at least scientifically,
rationally-based protocol.

2576
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:00,030
It's grounded in real neurochemistry.

2577
01:44:00,030 --> 01:44:03,097
It's grounded in things that
we can point to and say,

2578
01:44:03,097 --> 01:44:08,097
"Ah, this food substance, this
thing can support my brain,

2579
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:10,370
not directly because
it's some magic substance

2580
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:12,820
that's going to make all
my neurons, you know,

2581
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:16,110
extremely robust, but rather
it's going to support sleep,"

2582
01:44:16,110 --> 01:44:19,180
which is perhaps the
foundation of all mental

2583
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:20,013
and physical health.

2584
01:44:20,013 --> 01:44:23,530
In fact, we can point to
sleep as the primary way

2585
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:25,430
in which we can ensure our overall health,

2586
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:27,130
including our brain health.

2587
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:30,360
So let's talk about sleep
and how to access sleep,

2588
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,830
how to fall asleep easily,

2589
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,780
and how to make sure
that the sleep we have is

2590
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:36,770
of sufficient duration and quality.

2591
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,930
One way to do that is to
leverage the drop in temperature

2592
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:43,030
that's necessary to fall and stay asleep.

2593
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:46,470
So I mentioned earlier in the early parts

2594
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:48,400
of the day after waking,

2595
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,000
our body temperature is rising,

2596
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,190
and that continues throughout the day.

2597
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:52,920
And then sometime late in the afternoon,

2598
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,410
our temperature peaks,

2599
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:56,780
and then it starts to drop.

2600
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:00,140
That drop in temperature
of one to three degrees

2601
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:01,900
is vitally important for us to be able

2602
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,343
to fall asleep easily.

2603
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:06,700
One way that we can
decrease our transition time

2604
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:10,730
into sleep is to accelerate
that drop in temperature.

2605
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:12,440
And one way to accelerate that drop

2606
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,810
in temperature somewhat
counter-intuitively is

2607
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,890
to use hot baths, hot showers,

2608
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:21,200
or if you have access to one, a sauna.

2609
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,947
Now, this is counterintuitive
because you'd say,

2610
01:45:22,947 --> 01:45:25,410
"Well, hot bath, so it's
going to heat me up."

2611
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:28,060
But actually, if you
are to get into a sauna

2612
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:30,730
or a hot shower or hot
bath, and then get out,

2613
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:33,700
your body is going to
engage particular mechanisms

2614
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,849
for cooling itself off that are going

2615
01:45:35,849 --> 01:45:38,810
to allow you to drop your
temperature more quickly

2616
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:40,377
and fall asleep more easily.

2617
01:45:40,377 --> 01:45:41,990
And this is why many people find

2618
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:44,220
that falling asleep after
a nice hot shower, bath,

2619
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:49,110
or sauna is really, really
easy and really terrific.

2620
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:50,680
It's sort of a natural state

2621
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,740
that follows hot baths,
saunas, and showers.

2622
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,780
So how would you do this?

2623
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:58,070
Well, we did an entire
episode on this topic as well.

2624
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:00,210
The use of sauna for sake
of growth hormone release.

2625
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:02,140
If you want to check that
out in all the details,

2626
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,980
you can look at the
episode on growth hormone.

2627
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:09,110
You will experience a growth
hormone release from sauna,

2628
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:10,280
hot bath, and hot shower,

2629
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,600
provided they're done
for sufficient duration

2630
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,900
and sufficiently high temperature.

2631
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,040
For all the details of that,

2632
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,270
please go to that episode.

2633
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:19,120
It's all laid out there,
it's all timestamped,

2634
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,890
it's all captioned in English
and Spanish, et cetera.

2635
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:23,040
But basically what we're talking

2636
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,400
about is 20 minutes in the sauna,

2637
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,160
or if you're one of those folks

2638
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:29,080
who's really chasing
growth hormone release,

2639
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,320
you could do 20 minutes,

2640
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,010
then get out of the sauna for 10 minutes,

2641
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:33,700
and just cool off at room temperature,

2642
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,950
and then get back into
the sauna, then get out,

2643
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:39,403
and then shower, dry off, and head to bed.

2644
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,710
Shorter bouts of sauna will work also.

2645
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:45,930
The longer bouts of sauna, cooling, sauna,

2646
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:48,120
cooling have been shown
to lead to huge increases

2647
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:48,953
in growth hormone.

2648
01:46:48,953 --> 01:46:49,790
And growth hormone, of course,

2649
01:46:49,790 --> 01:46:51,760
is involved both in muscle growth,

2650
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,060
but also growth and
metabolism of all tissues,

2651
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:57,670
fat metabolism, and
repair of various tissues.

2652
01:46:57,670 --> 01:46:58,900
So it's not just about growth.

2653
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:00,820
You hear growth hormone,
you think hypertrophy,

2654
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:03,030
but the enhancement of
metabolism and health

2655
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:05,080
and repair in a number of tissues.

2656
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,690
So that's one way you can leverage heat

2657
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:10,700
toward the transition to sleep by the ways

2658
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:14,070
in which exposure to heat
actually cools off your body.

2659
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:16,020
Now let's talk about
actually getting to sleep.

2660
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,838
And let's talk about
behavioral protocols first.

2661
01:47:18,838 --> 01:47:20,380
It is absolutely true that keeping

2662
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,660
the room very dark is beneficial.

2663
01:47:22,660 --> 01:47:23,900
Some people, including myself,

2664
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:26,670
have thin eyelids and it
doesn't take much light

2665
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:28,830
to wake up the brain and body.

2666
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:31,300
So keeping a room very dark is essential.

2667
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:33,260
The other thing is keeping the room cool.

2668
01:47:33,260 --> 01:47:34,490
You've probably heard this before.

2669
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,883
Keep the room cool, get
under warm blankets,

2670
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,980
but rarely is it discussed why keeping

2671
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:41,730
the room cool is useful.

2672
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:44,550
The reason keeping the room cool is useful

2673
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:47,420
for getting into and
staying asleep is that

2674
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,960
throughout the night,

2675
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,250
there are phases of sleep
where you are paralyzed,

2676
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:53,840
so-called REM sleep,
that's a healthy paralysis,

2677
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,010
presumably so you can't
act out your dreams,

2678
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,870
but there are portions of
the night where you can move.

2679
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,260
And one of the more important movements

2680
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:02,350
that you do in the middle of
the night is put your hand

2681
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:05,500
out or your foot out or
you take your face out

2682
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:08,610
from under the covers as
a means to cool yourself,

2683
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:10,470
and you do this while you are asleep.

2684
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:13,090
If you are in a cool room,

2685
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:15,890
you can put yourself under
the blankets to stay warm,

2686
01:48:15,890 --> 01:48:17,890
and then if you want to cool off,

2687
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:19,660
you can simply remove a limb

2688
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,683
or you can toss the covers off entirely.

2689
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:25,850
However, if you are in
a room that's too warm,

2690
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:28,020
it's very hard to cool off.

2691
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:29,860
You would need a bucket of ice water

2692
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,210
or to get up and turn
on the air conditioning

2693
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:34,330
or something of that
sort or turn on the fan.

2694
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:37,080
So it's a simple but non-trivial way

2695
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,870
in which we can improve our entrance

2696
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:41,800
to sleep and staying asleep.

2697
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,970
So keep the room cool or cold
and get under warm blankets.

2698
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:48,160
And if you want to understand more

2699
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,000
about why putting a hand out

2700
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,560
or a foot out is valuable for cooling,

2701
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,970
I did an episode on the role of cooling

2702
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:59,020
in something called "heat dumping"

2703
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:02,757
or bringing he into the body
through the palms, the face,

2704
01:49:02,757 --> 01:49:03,810
and the bottoms of the feet.

2705
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:08,270
You've got these portals,
these radiators, if you will,

2706
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:11,450
that allow us to bring heat
into the body and to dump heat.

2707
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:12,700
I don't want to go into the details now,

2708
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,087
but that episode is entitled

2709
01:49:14,087 --> 01:49:16,530
"Supercharge Your Exercise With Cold,"

2710
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:17,810
is based on work that was done

2711
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:20,580
by Craig Heller's lab
at Stanford University.

2712
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:23,060
Absolutely incredible data showing

2713
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:25,390
that the proper use of palmar cooling,

2714
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:27,080
so the palms or the upper half of the face

2715
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:28,470
or the bottoms of the feet,

2716
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:32,390
can vastly, I mean vastly
increase the volume

2717
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:34,480
of exercise that one can do

2718
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,560
and still recover from that exercise

2719
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,150
and derive benefits from it.

2720
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:41,190
But this method of cooling
for exercise is grounded

2721
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:43,910
in a basic physiological
function of our palms,

2722
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,690
the bottoms of our feet, and our face,

2723
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:47,690
which is to dump heat

2724
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:50,230
or to allow cool to pass into the body.

2725
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:52,280
So that's why in the middle of the night,

2726
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:55,460
as long as you're not in REM
sleep, if you get too warm,

2727
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:58,570
you put your foot out or
you put your arms out.

2728
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:01,390
You're actually allowing
cooling of the body

2729
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:04,027
through what are called "AVAs,"

2730
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,380
arteriovenous anastomosis
is the technical name,

2731
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:10,427
that are in the palms, the
upper half of the face,

2732
01:50:10,427 --> 01:50:11,800
and the bottoms of the feet.

2733
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,100
And that's a very efficient
way to cool off your body,

2734
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,000
so you do that subconsciously.

2735
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,870
Now, there are things that one can take

2736
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,350
to enhance the transition to sleep.

2737
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:24,900
I am not a fan of melatonin
for enhancing the transition

2738
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,140
to sleep for a couple of reasons.

2739
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:28,460
One, dosages of melatonin are far too high

2740
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:30,180
in most supplements.

2741
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:32,190
Melatonin can have some negative effects

2742
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:35,010
on the sex steroid hormones
testosterone and estrogen.

2743
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:37,180
That's a serious concern.

2744
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,290
Third, melatonin's role during puberty

2745
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:42,170
or around puberty is to
suppress the onset of puberty.

2746
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:44,210
So that's concerning.

2747
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:45,880
I don't know that people
should be taking this hormone

2748
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:48,210
that has all these other effects.

2749
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:50,930
The other reason is that
melatonin will aid the transition

2750
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:52,087
to sleep, but it won't keep you asleep.

2751
01:50:52,087 --> 01:50:53,860
And many people that take melatonin find

2752
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:55,440
that they fall asleep more quickly,

2753
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,640
but then they wake up
unable to fall back asleep.

2754
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,690
Three compounds that
can be very beneficial

2755
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:02,580
for aiding the transition to sleep

2756
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:05,550
and for which there are
wide safety margins,

2757
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:07,140
although please do check
with your physician

2758
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:11,120
before taking anything, are
specific forms of magnesium,

2759
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,150
something called
"apigenin" and "theanine."

2760
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:15,790
Magnesium comes in many forms.

2761
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:18,050
Magnesium malate has been shown

2762
01:51:18,050 --> 01:51:21,444
to improve recovery from
sore muscles, for instance.

2763
01:51:21,444 --> 01:51:25,940
Magnesium citrate is an
excellent laxative, for instance,

2764
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:29,193
Magnesium threonate,
that's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,

2765
01:51:29,193 --> 01:51:34,100
threonate, and magnesium
bisglycinate have transporters

2766
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,380
that allow them to cross

2767
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:36,790
the blood-brain barrier more readily

2768
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:38,320
than other forms of magnesium.

2769
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,120
And there within the brain,

2770
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,980
they promote the release of a
neurotransmitter called GABA,

2771
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:44,720
which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter

2772
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:47,610
which shuts off the
forebrain to some extent.

2773
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:48,640
It doesn't shut it off completely,

2774
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,240
but it essentially shuts
down thinking, rumination,

2775
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,880
planning, and in what we
call "executive function."

2776
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,230
So for many people,

2777
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:59,870
taking 300 to 400 milligrams
of magnesium bisglycinate

2778
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:00,777
or magnesium threonate,

2779
01:52:00,777 --> 01:52:03,560
and there I'm referring
to the elemental magnesium

2780
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,510
for you aficionados,

2781
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:08,280
many people find that
doing that 30 to 60 minutes

2782
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,250
before sleep can aid
them in falling asleep,

2783
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:14,100
can really help them fall
asleep faster and stay asleep.

2784
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:15,490
Some people, however,

2785
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:18,600
achieve some gastrointestinal discomfort

2786
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,630
from magnesium and
therefore should avoid it.

2787
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:24,290
Magnesium threonate and
magnesium bisglycinate

2788
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,200
for many people work, however,

2789
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:30,460
and when coupled with
apigenin and theanine,

2790
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:33,880
provide a sort of synergy
or a sleep cocktail

2791
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,430
that seems to be very effective

2792
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:38,730
in aiding the transition to sleep.

2793
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:42,670
So apigenin is the substance
that's found in chamomile.

2794
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:45,440
And 50 milligrams of
apigenin taken 30 minutes

2795
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,240
before sleep can act as another way

2796
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:51,530
to shut off the forebrain
and reduce rumination,

2797
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:55,400
reduce anxiety, and allow
people to fall and stay asleep.

2798
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,320
I did a podcast with Dr. Darya Rose.

2799
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,080
She's got an excellent podcast

2800
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,420
that I highly recommend you check out.

2801
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:03,420
Covers a number of different
health, scientific,

2802
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,770
and other subjects.

2803
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:06,680
And she's a PhD in neuroscience,

2804
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,320
terrific scientist, et cetera.

2805
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:11,100
She's a big fan of apigenin, as am I.

2806
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:14,993
And then the third compound
is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.

2807
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:20,960
Theanine is a compound that
can also increase GABA,

2808
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,240
but also increases activation

2809
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:24,970
of something called "chloride channels."

2810
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:26,350
Chloride channels are another way

2811
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:30,490
in which neurons turn themselves
off or turn each other off.

2812
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:32,020
Not turn each other off in the way

2813
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:33,610
that we typically hear
like that turns me off,

2814
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:34,850
but turn them off and then shut them down.

2815
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,900
Lower their levels of activity.

2816
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,990
So magnesium threonate or bisglycinate,

2817
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:43,480
apigenin, and theanine in
combination can be very effective

2818
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,110
for aiding the transition to sleep.

2819
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:47,750
And I realized that not everyone
wants to take supplements.

2820
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:49,650
I certainly am not pushing any of these.

2821
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:52,690
I would hope that everybody
be able to fall asleep easily

2822
01:53:52,690 --> 01:53:54,710
and stay asleep for the duration of time

2823
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:57,110
that they want without
any supplemental help,

2824
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:59,450
but I do think it's important
to point out some things

2825
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:01,350
that lie somewhere between doing nothing

2826
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:02,880
and taking prescription drugs,

2827
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,270
because many of the
prescription drugs associated

2828
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:08,520
with sleep, and you all
know what those are,

2829
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,390
carry other side effects.

2830
01:54:10,390 --> 01:54:13,500
They can create bad dreams,

2831
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,150
often very disturbing dreams.

2832
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:17,700
They can be addictive or
at least habit forming.

2833
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:19,680
They can create grogginess in the morning.

2834
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:20,810
Some are safer than others.

2835
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:22,530
There's a variety of them out there.

2836
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:25,530
But for those that want
to explore supplements

2837
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:26,680
and how they can impact sleep,

2838
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,357
this combination of about 300,

2839
01:54:28,357 --> 01:54:31,880
400 milligrams of magnesium
threonate or bisglycinate,

2840
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,600
50 milligrams of apigenin,

2841
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,310
and 100 to 200 milligrams
of theanine alone

2842
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:39,710
or in combination have been
beneficial to many people.

2843
01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,290
And there are excellent studies

2844
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:42,590
to support those statements.

2845
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:44,950
Again, I suggest you go to examine.com

2846
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:47,000
and look up the Human Effect Matrix

2847
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,180
for each of those compounds,

2848
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,490
and you can explore them.

2849
01:54:49,490 --> 01:54:52,900
One of the more interesting
aspects to magnesium threonate

2850
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,790
and bisglycinate is that it seems

2851
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:57,090
to have some neuroprotective
effects as well.

2852
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:58,240
There aren't many studies on it,

2853
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,830
but the few studies that are there point

2854
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:01,287
to the fact that magnesium threonate

2855
01:55:01,287 --> 01:55:02,840
and magnesium bisglycinate can

2856
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,840
also support neuron health
and neuron longevity,

2857
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,000
which is just an added
bonus, in my opinion.

2858
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,330
Now, what if you wake up
in the middle of the night?

2859
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:12,530
This is a very common occurrence.

2860
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:15,650
And there are two general
themes around waking up

2861
01:55:15,650 --> 01:55:16,760
in the middle of the night

2862
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,410
that one can use tools to counteract.

2863
01:55:20,410 --> 01:55:22,490
The first theme is if you're somebody

2864
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:24,640
who is tired in the evenings

2865
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,350
and you're kind of pushing
yourself to stay awake,

2866
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:29,770
so you're going to the party
or you're pushing yourself

2867
01:55:29,770 --> 01:55:32,280
to study or work when in fact you'd like

2868
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,940
to get into bed at 8:30 or 9:00,

2869
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:36,190
and then you're falling
asleep around 10:30, 11:00,

2870
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:37,777
and waking up at 2:30
or 3:00 in the morning

2871
01:55:37,777 --> 01:55:39,890
and you can't fall back asleep,

2872
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:42,680
chances are that your melatonin pulse

2873
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,130
was initiated early in the night.

2874
01:55:45,130 --> 01:55:48,040
So that melatonin pulse started probably

2875
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:51,180
around 8:30 or 9:00,
but you're staying up,

2876
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:53,000
you're battling that melatonin.

2877
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,190
And then sometime around
2:30 or 3:00 in the morning,

2878
01:55:57,190 --> 01:55:59,280
that melatonin is no longer present

2879
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,150
at sufficiently high
levels in your bloodstream

2880
01:56:01,150 --> 01:56:02,230
and you're waking up,

2881
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:04,373
you're getting your morning
cortisol pulse shifted

2882
01:56:04,373 --> 01:56:07,343
into those wee hours of the morning.

2883
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:09,940
You may not like this advice,

2884
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,460
but one of the things
that you can do to offset

2885
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,890
that is to simply go to bed earlier.

2886
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:15,290
By going to bed earlier,

2887
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:17,500
you're going to get the
longer duration of sleep.

2888
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,160
But I realized that
there are social reasons

2889
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:20,220
and work-related reasons why going

2890
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:24,180
to bed at 8:30 or 9:00 is
not necessarily beneficial

2891
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:25,640
to your life.

2892
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:26,803
So in that case,

2893
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:29,540
you might be one of the rare individuals

2894
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,720
for whom getting a little
bit more bright light

2895
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:33,640
in the evening could be a good thing.

2896
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,010
So this would be around the
hours of 7:00 or 8:00 PM.

2897
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:40,810
And in that way, causing
that pulse in melatonin

2898
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:45,810
to be delayed because, again,
light inhibits melatonin.

2899
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:48,100
Now, the other thing
is many people wake up

2900
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:50,250
in the middle of the
night because of anxiety

2901
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:52,540
or because they have to use the restroom.

2902
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:54,240
It's perfectly fine to flip on the lights,

2903
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:56,440
but keep the lights dim.

2904
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:57,790
But if you flip on those lights,

2905
01:56:57,790 --> 01:57:00,240
try and flip them off as soon as possible

2906
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:02,020
and try and get back into bed.

2907
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:03,767
And if you have trouble
falling asleep again

2908
01:57:03,767 --> 01:57:05,470
and you absolutely need to sleep,

2909
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:07,100
that's where these NSDR,

2910
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,760
these non-sleep deep rest protocols,

2911
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,130
can really be beneficial,

2912
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:13,330
even though the NS, the non-sleep part,

2913
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:15,980
might make you think that
they will prevent you

2914
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,300
from falling asleep.

2915
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,990
Rather than trying to fight your mind,

2916
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:21,840
trying to fight anxiety,

2917
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,390
which is always a terrible thing to do,

2918
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:24,310
I always say it's very hard

2919
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:26,440
to control the mind with
the mind, look to the body.

2920
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:28,510
And that's what NSDR scripts do.

2921
01:57:28,510 --> 01:57:29,640
Things like yoga nidra,

2922
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:33,460
even the sleep hypnosis done
in the middle of the night

2923
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:35,190
if you wake up and want
to fall back asleep

2924
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:39,210
oftentimes will help you
fall back asleep immediately.

2925
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:40,240
And if they don't,

2926
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:42,050
they will at least put your brain and body

2927
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:43,950
into a state of deep relaxation

2928
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:46,210
that more closely mimics the sleep state

2929
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:47,043
that you ought to be in

2930
01:57:47,043 --> 01:57:48,970
than the awake, ruminating,

2931
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:51,530
stressing about the fact that
you're not sleeping state.

2932
01:57:51,530 --> 01:57:53,280
So if you wake up in
the middle of the night,

2933
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,040
really try and get back to sleep.

2934
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,960
And if you can't do that
by doing, for instance,

2935
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,350
long exhale breathing, which can work,

2936
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:04,060
use some other tool of the
body to shift the mind.

2937
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:06,130
And the tools that I'm recommending are

2938
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:08,490
of the non-sleep deep rest variety.

2939
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:11,530
So now we've essentially
traveled around the clock,

2940
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:14,440
so to speak, from the
time where one wakes up

2941
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:17,010
until the time they start working,

2942
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:20,440
until the time they exercise, eat lunch,

2943
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:24,580
do an NSDR, head to sleep,
get to sleep, maybe wake up,

2944
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:27,130
get back to sleep, et cetera.

2945
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:28,990
I want to emphasize that,

2946
01:58:28,990 --> 01:58:30,450
although people's schedules vary,

2947
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:33,130
most people are doing more than one

2948
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:34,570
or two work bouts per day.

2949
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:36,640
And indeed, I'm doing more than one

2950
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:38,170
or two work bouts per day.

2951
01:58:38,170 --> 01:58:41,160
I really emphasize that
morning, 90-minute work block

2952
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:44,180
because I think most people would agree

2953
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:46,490
that there's a portion of each day

2954
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:48,660
in which we need to do the hardest thing

2955
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:50,410
or the most important thing

2956
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:53,993
or the thing that demands the
most of our cognitive self.

2957
01:58:54,830 --> 01:58:56,390
I position that early in the day

2958
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:58,680
and I position everything around that

2959
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:00,720
in order to ensure that it happens

2960
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:03,650
and that it happens with the
highest degree of efficiency,

2961
01:59:03,650 --> 01:59:06,030
and yes, I make sure that
it happens every day.

2962
01:59:06,030 --> 01:59:08,880
And that brings about two
other important points.

2963
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:12,420
First of all, we do have
this thing called weekends,

2964
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:16,100
and I tend to take one day
off per week, not both,

2965
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:20,000
much to the dismay of people
in my life and Costello.

2966
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,050
But nonetheless, there is
something called weekend drift,

2967
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:26,550
which is that we can be very regimented

2968
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:28,030
on a Monday or a Tuesday,

2969
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:29,980
and then even if we're good

2970
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:32,050
about maintaining a schedule
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

2971
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:35,450
et cetera, most of us, I would hope,

2972
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:37,830
would alter their schedule
somewhat on the weekends

2973
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:40,930
in order to recover and
get some additional rest.

2974
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:43,520
And I want to emphasize
I absolutely do that.

2975
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:46,560
I take one day per week
where I go full Costello,

2976
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,170
where I essentially do
nothing in a structured way.

2977
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:52,180
At least if I have my way,
I'm not making any plans,

2978
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:55,240
I'm completely free to
explore what I want to do

2979
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:56,540
and when I want to do it.

2980
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:57,830
That's not the way life works out.

2981
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:59,450
Oftentimes there are social engagements

2982
01:59:59,450 --> 02:00:01,530
and other things that get in the way

2983
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:04,390
or that I enjoy and
that breaks up the day,

2984
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,290
but I do take rest.

2985
02:00:06,290 --> 02:00:07,790
I don't think that one has

2986
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:09,880
to follow the same
schedule every single day;

2987
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,640
however, I do think there are a few things

2988
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:15,290
that people should do every
single day, if possible,

2989
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:18,330
and those are get morning sunlight,

2990
02:00:18,330 --> 02:00:20,150
because if you don't
your circadian rhythms

2991
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:21,110
and your health, et cetera,

2992
02:00:21,110 --> 02:00:23,480
and your mood are going to start to drift,

2993
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:26,870
and to try and get sleep
on a regular basis.

2994
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:29,080
And, of course, some of
the greatest of things

2995
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:31,360
in life happen after 10:00 PM

2996
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,980
and some of those even
involve sleepless nights

2997
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:36,040
of various kinds.

2998
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,750
I certainly don't want
to discourage people

2999
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:39,140
from having a social life

3000
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:41,610
or from having a robust party life,

3001
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:44,770
if that's your thing, or for enjoying life

3002
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:47,400
because that's certainly
one of the main things

3003
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,850
that we should all be
pursuing, is to enjoy life.

3004
02:00:50,970 --> 02:00:53,040
The only point I want
to make about sleep is

3005
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,400
that if you happen to stay up late,

3006
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,210
it's still best to get up at
your regular wake-up time.

3007
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:01,330
It's a very simple solution to a problem

3008
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:02,560
that a lot of people have,

3009
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,370
which is they stay up till
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,

3010
02:01:04,370 --> 02:01:05,770
and then they tend to sleep late,

3011
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:07,810
and then it tends to disrupt their rhythm.

3012
02:01:07,810 --> 02:01:11,090
Try on most days and most nights

3013
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:13,150
to wake up at more or less the same time

3014
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:15,970
and try to go to sleep at
more or less the same time.

3015
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:18,900
In fact, I was talking to Matt
Walker about this recently,

3016
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:21,340
and he was also surprised
to see these new data

3017
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,910
and I was surprised to see these new data

3018
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:25,900
that emphasize that if you
get a poor night's sleep

3019
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:29,120
or if you're up late the
previous night for good reasons,

3020
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:30,240
many people feel like they just

3021
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,070
want to go to bed early the next night,

3022
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:34,520
but it turns out that's
not the best thing to do

3023
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,590
for your immediate and long-term health.

3024
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:37,880
Try and stay up to the point

3025
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,570
where you would normally stay up,

3026
02:01:39,570 --> 02:01:40,420
and then get to sleep.

3027
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:42,170
If you go to bed a couple hours earlier,

3028
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,420
it's probably not going to kill you,

3029
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:46,930
but try to not go to bed,
for instance, at 6:00 PM,

3030
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:48,600
because you were up the
entire night before.

3031
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:50,870
That can really be disruptive.

3032
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:52,250
The other thing I want to emphasize is

3033
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:55,900
that even though that morning,
90-minute work block is

3034
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:59,480
so vital, of course,
there's a second work block.

3035
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,680
And in fact, I described one

3036
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:02,660
in the afternoon after the NSDR.

3037
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:04,840
For me, that's Reveri hypnosis.

3038
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,660
There's a 90-minute work block

3039
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:11,350
in which I drop in again in
a no internet connection,

3040
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:14,500
no phone kind of way to complete some work

3041
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,690
that's important to me.

3042
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:18,210
So combined, that's just
three hours of focused work,

3043
02:02:18,210 --> 02:02:20,220
which may not seem like a lot,

3044
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:22,180
but if you were to dissect your day

3045
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,800
and kind of look at the arc
and structure of your day,

3046
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,810
I'd be willing to bet that

3047
02:02:27,690 --> 02:02:30,100
if we added up the total period of time

3048
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:33,800
in which you were in what Cal
Newport would call deep work,

3049
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,620
really focused, dedicated work,

3050
02:02:35,620 --> 02:02:39,100
that it would probably amount
to about three or four hours.

3051
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:42,100
If you can squeeze in
another 90-minute work block

3052
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:44,750
or if you can get four
90-minute work blocks,

3053
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:45,860
well, then more power to you,

3054
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:47,690
but I think most people find that one

3055
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:51,600
or two of these really deep
focus, 90-minute work blocks are

3056
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:55,410
about what one's schedule
and even mind can handle.

3057
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:56,970
And, of course, throughout the day,

3058
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:58,470
there are other things happening.

3059
02:02:58,470 --> 02:03:00,870
Outside of those 90-minute work blocks,

3060
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:03,390
I'm checking my text messages,
I'm checking my email,

3061
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:05,100
I'm responding to various demands.

3062
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:08,040
I'm working and tending to life.

3063
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:11,100
So while I've carved some boundaries

3064
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,610
or delineated some boundaries
around those work blocks,

3065
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:15,550
and I'm certain that if you do too,

3066
02:03:15,550 --> 02:03:16,850
you will benefit from them,

3067
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:19,670
they are certainly not the
only periods of time each day

3068
02:03:19,670 --> 02:03:22,350
in which I or I believe
other people should be trying

3069
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:24,270
to learn or trying to focus.

3070
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:26,740
And I want to emphasize
that even though my job is

3071
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:29,660
to discover knowledge
and distribute knowledge

3072
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:30,700
because I'm a scientist,

3073
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:33,410
I realized that 90-minute
work blocks of the sort

3074
02:03:33,410 --> 02:03:37,010
that I'm describing may
not apply specifically

3075
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:37,960
to the kinds of work you do.

3076
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:39,580
If you're an artist or a sculptor

3077
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:41,230
or you build furniture,

3078
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:42,230
whatever it is that you happen to,

3079
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:44,180
you teach children or they teach you,

3080
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:45,930
whatever it happens to be,

3081
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:50,390
of course, please adapt and
modify what I've described today

3082
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:52,820
in ways that best serve
you and your schedule.

3083
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:55,610
What I've tried to do
is provide you a picture

3084
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:58,530
of the 24- hour schedule that I follow

3085
02:03:58,530 --> 02:04:01,760
and why I do certain
things at particular times

3086
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,690
and why I do those particular things.

3087
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:06,530
And I've really tried to
emphasize the scientific rationale

3088
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:09,320
behind those things,
the peer-reviewed data.

3089
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:11,460
In some cases, I pointed
out the specific papers.

3090
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:14,290
In other cases, I've referred
to large bodies of work

3091
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:16,110
that support these practices.

3092
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:17,990
When I say "large bodies of work,"

3093
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:21,080
I'm a big fan of looking to
the scientific literature

3094
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:23,970
and asking, "Where is the center of mass

3095
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:25,760
for a particular topic?"

3096
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:30,760
For instance, where is there
50 or 100 or 1,000 papers

3097
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:34,220
that, for instance, support
morning light viewing

3098
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:38,930
in order to optimize melatonin
secretion in the day,

3099
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:41,000
cortisol secretion early in the day,

3100
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,180
mood, metabolism, et cetera?

3101
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:46,990
If one were to put into
PubMed "light, metabolism,

3102
02:04:46,990 --> 02:04:50,590
and mood," you would literally
get tens of thousands,

3103
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:52,410
maybe even hundreds of
thousands of studies.

3104
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:53,750
So when I say the center of mass,

3105
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:57,000
what I've really tried to
do is examine the literature

3106
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,970
and figure out where there's
sort of a directive protocol

3107
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:02,970
that emerges from all
these various studies

3108
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:05,160
that used, you know,
in some cases, animals,

3109
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:07,870
in many cases, humans
and explored different,

3110
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:09,880
what we call, "dependent variables."

3111
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:11,960
Some studies were looking
at effects on blood sugar,

3112
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:13,370
other on mood.

3113
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:16,580
So I hope that makes
clear why the rationale

3114
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:18,320
behind what I provided today.

3115

3132
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,610
During today's episode,

3133
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:04,860
I described various supplements

3134
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:07,000
that one might want to consider taking.

3135
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,360
We've partnered with Thorne,

3136
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:10,820
that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com,

3137
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:12,570
because Thorne supplements are known

3138
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:15,760
to be of the very highest
stringency and quality.

3139
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,210
When I say stringency and quality,

3140
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:20,110
that means the quality of
the individual ingredients,

3141
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:23,380
as well as the amounts of those
ingredients match precisely

3142
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:25,320
with what's listed on the packaging.

3143
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,900
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I personally take,

3144
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:32,650
you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman.

3145
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:34,850
And there, you'll see all of
the supplements that I take,

3146
02:06:34,850 --> 02:06:37,750
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

3147
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:40,700
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

3148
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:42,220
