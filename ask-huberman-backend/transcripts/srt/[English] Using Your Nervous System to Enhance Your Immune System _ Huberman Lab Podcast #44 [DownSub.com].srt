1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,417
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,953
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,050
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,310
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,270
Today, we are discussing
the immune system,

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,640
and we are also discussing
the nervous system,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,170
which is the brain, spinal cord,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,010
and the connections of
the brain and spinal cord

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,763
with all the organs of the body.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,620
We are also going to discuss
how the nervous system can be

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,720
used to activate and
control the immune system.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,960
Now, about 10, 20 years ago,

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,760
if somebody said that
the mind could control

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,300
the immune system, they'd
probably get laughed out

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,960
of most academic conferences.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,570
And certainly the work
wouldn't be published

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,060
in quality journals, but
nowadays there are dozens,

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,550
if not hundreds of quality
peer-reviewed studies

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,700
on how the mind and how the nervous system

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,230
can control activation
of the immune system.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,860
This is a wonderful
growing body of research.

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,510
And just to give you a hint of

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,790
where we are headed with
this, just this last week,

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,950
there was a paper published in "Nature"

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,070
which is the apex journal
for scientific publishing,

27
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,763
premiere journal, extremely stringent,

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,200
a paper published in "Nature"

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,240
from Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School,

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,700
explored how acupuncture can reduce

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,620
inflammation in the body.

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,110
And I will describe this study
in a bit more detail later,

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,700
but what they discovered was
that by stimulating the body

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,480
in particular ways at
particular sites on the body,

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,040
they were able to liberate
certain cells and molecules

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,960
that enhance the function
of the immune system,

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,760
and potentially can be used to combat

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,580
different types of infection.

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,650
And just to give you another little hint,

40
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,310
they found that a particular
type of organ tissue

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,620
called fascia, some of you
may have heard of fascia,

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,980
fascia surrounds our muscles.

43
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,813
Just to look at it,

44
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:00,380
you might think it's a
kind of useless tissue,

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,130
it's sort of like a dense bag

46
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,030
in which the muscles are contained.

47
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,140
Well, it turns out that those dense bags

48
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,450
are much smarter than we thought.

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,620
They don't have a mind of their own,

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,889
but by stimulating the fascia

51
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,300
in a particular location on the body,

52
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,540
there's a pathway leading
out of that fascia

53
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,430
directly to an organ
called the adrenal medulla,

54
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,630
I'll explain what all this means,

55
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,330
that could liberate particular chemicals

56
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,980
that had a potent
anti-inflammatory effect.

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,430
So what we're basically saying

58
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,850
is that the nervous system
acts as a set of highways

59
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,830
between the different
tissues of your body,

60
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,410
calling into action the immune system,

61
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,170
liberating particular molecules
that can reduce inflammation

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,410
and lead to faster healing.

63
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,430
And I will explain how all of that works

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,700
as well as some other
non-acupuncture methods

65
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,170
for activating and enhancing the function

66
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,060
of the immune system.

67
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,990
So, today, we're going
to be talking all about

68
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,110
healing with the mind in
a completely non-mystical,

69
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,080
non-abstract sense.

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,040
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

71
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,930
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

72
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,200
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,260
to bring zero cost to consumer information

74
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,580
about science and science-related tools

75
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,080
to the general public.

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,270
In keeping with that theme,

77
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,290
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

78
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,630
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

79
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,980
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

80
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,910
that are absolute suburb quality.

81
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,290
I've spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,

82
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,720
and I can tell you that
one of the major issues

83
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,840
our visual system has to contend with

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,020
is how to see things clearly
in bright environments

85
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,490
or dimmer environments, et cetera.

86
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,150
ROKA clearly understands the
science of the visual system,

87
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,410
because one thing that's
wonderful about their sunglasses

88
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,080
is that you can be in a
very bright environment

89
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,250
and then walk into a shadowed environment

90
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,900
and you don't even notice the transition.

91
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,663
Everything is still seen
with crystal clarity.

92
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,020
Their eyeglasses as well
allow you to see things

93
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,780
regardless of how bright or
dim internal lighting is.

94
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,470
I wear readers at night, I
wear sunglasses during the day,

95
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,340
and ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses are particularly nice

96
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,610
because they're very lightweight,

97
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,520
so I often forget that
they're even on my face.

98
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,840
They also don't slip
off if you get sweaty.

99
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,630
They were actually designed to be used

100
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,250
while running or cycling.

101
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,950
And so I can use them while exercising.

102
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,130
They also have a great aesthetic.

103
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,260
So you can go from exercising,
to dinner or to work,

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,220
without having to change

105
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,580
from one set of glasses to the next.

106
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,790
If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com,

107
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,740
that's R-O-K-A.com and

108
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,320
to save 20% off your first order.

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,840
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,130
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,

111
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,100
mineral probiotic drink.

112
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,607
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012.

113
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:45,700
And so, I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

114
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,

115
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,320
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

116
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,350
once or twice per day is
because it allows me to cover

117
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,490
all of my basic nutritional bases.

118
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,850
It's got the vitamins and
minerals that make sure

119
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,100
that no matter what I'm eating,

120
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,450
I'm covering all of my
micronutrient bases.

121
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,080
And it has the probiotics,

122
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,360
and probiotics we now know are essential

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,020
for a healthy gut microbiome.

124
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,850
And a healthy gut microbiome
we know is essential

125
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,390
for many important biological functions

126
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,080
related to human health,
like metabolic needs,

127
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,830
endocrine function, immune
function, and so on.

128
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,070
With Athletic Greens, I
can mix that up with water.

129
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,200
I usually add some lemon or lime juice.

130
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,150
It tastes delicious.

131
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,830
I like it very much and I'll
drink it once early in the day,

132
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,083
and once again later in the afternoon.

133
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,440
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

134
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,967
you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman.

135
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,650
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

136
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,310
They'll give you five free travel packs,

137
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,420
which make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens,

138
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,330
whether you're in the car, or
on a plane, or on the move,

139
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,150
and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3K2.

140
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,270
There is now a lot of data
showing that vitamin D3

141
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,590
is important for many biological functions

142
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,890
that impact our immediate
and long-term health.

143
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,290
And most people do not
get enough vitamin D3,

144
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,080
even if they're getting a lot of sunshine.

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,010
And K2 is also important or
has been shown to be important

146
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,470
for heart health and for blood
lipid function, et cetera.

147
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,480
So, again, if you'd like
to try Athletic Greens,

148
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,570
you can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman

149
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,990
to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

150
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,880
and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

151
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,241
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

152
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,730
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

153
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,560
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,140
to help you better meet your immediate

155
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,090
and long-term health goals.

156
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,010
I've long been a fan of
getting regular blood work done

157
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,610
for the simple reason
that many of the things

158
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,940
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

159
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,540
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

160
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,970
There's just simply no
other body surface marker

161
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,877
that you can look at
somebody or yourself and say,

162
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:47,270
"Ah, I know that my blood lipids
or my cholesterol are good,

163
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,570
or that my hormone levels are X, Y, or Z."

164
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,280
We really need numbers on those things

165
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
to know where they sit.

166
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,220
The problem with a lot
of blood tests, however,

167
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,730
is you get all those numbers back,

168
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,620
you don't know what to
do with that information.

169
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,370
InsideTracker has solved that problem,

170
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,490
and they have a very easy to use dashboard

171
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,950
where when you get your numbers back,

172
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,490
it can tell you for instance,

173
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,270
where your numbers are
high or low or on target.

174
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,420
And they can suggest very
specific dietary intervention,

175
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,290
supplemental interventions,
and behavioral interventions

176
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,050
that can allow you to bring those numbers

177
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,410
to where you would like them to be.

178
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,010
So they've simplified the whole process.

179
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,540
And in terms of getting the blood tests,

180
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,610
you can go to a local center
to get the blood drawn,

181
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,270
or they can even send
somebody to your house.

182
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,010
So, they've made the whole
thing very, very easy

183
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,490
from start to finish.

184
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,350

You just use the code
"Huberman" at checkout.

188
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,430
Okay, let's talk about the immune system,

189
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,310
and the nervous system,
and how the two interact,

190
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,760
and how you can control your immune system

191
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,730
to serve you better.

192
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,539
We are going to talk a lot
of mechanistic science,

193
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:58,110
a little bit of detail,
you'll learn some new language

194
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,540
around the immune system;

195
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,340
names of the different
cell types and so forth,

196
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,210
but I promised to make it all very clear,

197
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,940
regardless of your background.

198
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,450
We are also going to
discuss a lot of tools.

199
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,810
And I think many of you are
probably here because you want

200
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,530
to know what you can do in order to boost

201
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,610
or enhance the function
of your immune system.

202
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,633
That's a very reasonable question to ask.

203
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,560
I want to begin by just
acknowledging that if one were

204
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,670
to put that question into the internet,

205
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,230
you would get back a lot of answers.

206
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,660
And there is now a sort of
generic form of that answer

207
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,500
that deserves our respect,

208
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,383
but is not going to be the
topic of conversation today.

209
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,640
I just want to tip my hat to it, however,

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,840
and list off a few of
the things that we know

211
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,970
set us up to be healthier than we would be

212
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,950
if we didn't do these things.

213
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,460
So the first of course is
the foundation of all mental

214
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,250
and physical health, which
is to get adequate sleep.

215
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,350
Meaning enough sleep,
whatever it is for you

216
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,630
that you require,

217
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,370
to get deep sleep, so it's
got to be of high quality,

218
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,650
and to time that sleep correctly.

219
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,320
Meaning you can't sleep
during the day one day,

220
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,270
and at night the next day,

221
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,930
and expect your system to function well.

222
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,930
I've talked a lot about
that before on this podcast.

223
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,660
You need a relatively
consistent sleep schedule

224
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,520
most of the time, about 80% of the time,

225
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,410
or even better would be 90% of the time.

226
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,030
But the realities of life
make it that we can't always

227
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,070
go to bed at the same time

228
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,610
and wake up at the exact same time.

229
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,580
Okay, so we need sleep.

230
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,720
We do need sunshine.

231
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,760
Why do we need sunshine?

232
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,850
Because it sets our rhythm
into a regular state

233
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,560
where the genes in all of our cells

234
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,300
can be expressed at the correct times.

235
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,360
We're sort of a factory
of cells, if you will,

236
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,240
and that factory can only
run properly if it knows

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,020
when certain things should be active

238
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,310
and when certain cells
should not be active.

239
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,880
And the best way to coordinate
all of those activities

240
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,730
of all the cells is to
get sunshine in your eyes

241
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,980
in the morning and again in the evening,

242
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,200
and not to get too much
bright light in your eyes

243
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,560
in the middle of the night.

244
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,900
That's just foundational.

245
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,910
And then any lists that you'll find

246
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,187
on any number of websites
on the internet would say,

247
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:03,080
"Okay, get good sleep,
get sun, get exercise."

248
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,190
How much exercise?

249
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,710
We should all be getting
150 to 180 minutes

250
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,480
of zone two cardio.

251
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,270
That's cardiovascular
exercise where we can

252
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,520
just barely hold a conversation
or maybe not, per week.

253
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,700
We should be eating well.

254
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,270
We're always told we have
to get good nutrition.

255
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,690
What good nutrition means to
you is going to be different

256
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,980
than what it means to somebody else.

257
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,490
But we acknowledge that food intake

258
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,010
and quality of food in particular,
avoiding processed foods,

259
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,300
that's going to be important.

260
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,710
Social connection is important.

261
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,970
Hydration is important.

262
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,720
You're starting to get the picture.

263
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,890
We can take all that,
acknowledge it as useful

264
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,690
and foundational for
mental and physical health.

265
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,140
But of course there are many
people who still struggle

266
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,020
with getting ill too often,

267
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,540
or with not being able to heal

268
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,700
from physical injuries and wounds,

269
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,940
or from various bacterial
and viral infections

270
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,210
quickly enough or deal
with chronic disease.

271
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,390
And so, today's really about how you can

272
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,060
take all of that information,
acknowledge it, and follow it.

273
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,520
But in addition to that,

274
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
there are things that
you can do to leverage

275
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,530
your nervous system in order
to enhance the function

276
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,800
of your immune system in very robust ways.

277
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,420
So that's where I'd like to
shift the conversation to.

278
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,200
The first topic we have to
attack is the question of

279
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,800
what is the immune system
and how does it work?

280
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I think many of you have heard
of antibodies or killer cells

281
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,160
or the various organs of
the body that are involved

282
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,993
in the immune system,

283
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:34,110
like the bone marrow,
the spleen, the thymus,

284
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,253
and the lymph nodes.

285
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,640
I'd like to just take a
moment and do a sort of

286
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,950
brief immune system 101; really simple,

287
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,810
cover the basic elements
of the immune system

288
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,160
so that everyone
listening or watching this

289
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,700
can get a clear sense of how
the immune system functions

290
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,200
and what its basic parts are.

291
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,380
For some of you, this might be too basic.

292
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,970
It might be a little bit of background

293
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,000
that you already know.

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,450
I think for most of you,
this information will be new.

295
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,380
And I promise you, you
don't need a biology

296
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,300
or medicine background in
order to understand this.

297
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,590
It's actually really simple

298
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,580
because it is truly elegant in design.

299
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,580
You have three main layers
of defense for your health.

300
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,610
These are the three things
that are constantly at work

301
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,610
to protect you from invasion
and illness from bacteria,

302
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,290
from viruses, and from parasites.

303
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,180
And the first of those
three is a physical barrier

304
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,120
that we call your skin.

305
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,500
And that might seem kind of obvious,

306
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,340
but everything about you is
contained in this compartment

307
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,350
that is boundaried by your skin.

308
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,130
And your skin is a very important aspect

309
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,840
of your immune system.

310
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,130
If you've ever had a cut,

311
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,930
you essentially have a
breach of the boundary

312
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,870
that is your immune system,

313
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,000
and you would notice a number
of things would happen.

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,280
You might get some
swelling around that cut.

315
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,570
You might get a scab, likely
you would get a scab over time.

316
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,900
If it got dirty, there were
some bacteria that got in there,

317
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,130
you might see some accumulation
of white blood cells,

318
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,963
what's called puss.

319
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:13,260
I know it's kind of gross,
but that's what that is.

320
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,090
It might take on a yellow tint
because of the accumulation

321
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,100
of some dead cells there.

322
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,760
But basically your skin
is the primary barrier

323
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,170
through which you keep
things from the outside

324
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,940
that could harm you from
getting to the inside.

325
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,640
Now, still in category one,

326
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,810
your body and your external surface,

327
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,330
you have openings to that surface, right?

328
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,990
You're not just a round or a body shaped

329
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,760
completely covered up with skin.

330
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,330
You have openings, what
are those openings?

331
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,170
Well, let's start at the
top and work our way down.

332
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,140
A primary site of potential
infection are your eyes.

333
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,010
You have your ears,
you have your nostrils,

334
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,980
you have your mouth.

335
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,230
Okay, those are going
to be the primary sites

336
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,930
by which things can get into your system.

337
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,300
And you need to put
things into your system;

338
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,320
you need to drink and eat,

339
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,880
and you need to get
light into your system.

340
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,660
That's why you have those openings,

341
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,820
but bad things, meaning
things that can harm you,

342
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,160
can get into those systems.

343
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,573
And then of course, along
the back of your throat,

344
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,210
all the way down to your stomach
and your digestive system,

345
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,300
and through your intestines
and out your rectum,

346
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,450
you have a tube, that you are
basically a series of tubes.

347
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,820
I've said that before on this podcast,

348
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,510
and this is one such tube by
which you extract nutrients

349
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,170
from the outside environment.

350
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,500
But all along that tube,

351
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,180
including your nose and your
mouth, it's lined with mucus.

352
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,350
And while mucus might seem
kind of gross to some of you,

353
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,430
the more you learn about mucus,

354
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,450
the more you realize that
mucus is really, really cool

355
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,190
because mucus essentially
acts as a filter,

356
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,460
as a trap for bacteria and viruses.

357
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,290
And it has certain ways of scrubbing

358
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,193
or killing those bacteria and viruses.

359
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,900
Now, the mucus is constantly
being turned over,

360
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,120
as we'll talk about later,

361
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,160
the chemistry of that
mucus is really important

362
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,090
in order to make sure that certain things

363
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,240
don't make it into your system,

364
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,440
and other things are allowed
to move through your system

365
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,580
and you can extract nutrients from them.

366
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,720
So the reason I'm talking
about this first category

367
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,480
of barrier for immune
system in such detail

368
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,180
is I'd like you to envision
yourself as a human, of course,

369
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,550
but as a human that is a clear
entity from everything else.

370
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,960
And you have to bring in the right things

371
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,893
and you have to keep out the
wrong things or kill them.

372
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,530
Now, inevitably, bacteria, viruses,

373
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,250
and parasitic infections
are going to make their way

374
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,590
into our body, but whether
or not they are killed off

375
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,570
or whether or not they
take over and cause us harm

376
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,100
is going to be determined
by layers two and three.

377
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,270
So, layers two and three are the so-called

378
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,660
innate immune system and
the adaptive immune system.

379
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,180
So the innate immune
system is what I would call

380
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,370
the second layer of defense.

381
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,510
It's very fast.

382
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,910
So whether or not it's
bacteria, virus, or parasite,

383
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,910
what happens when you have
something enter your body,

384
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,420
maybe you swallowed it, maybe
got in through your eyes,

385
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,710
maybe you shook somebody's
hand who is carrying

386
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,230
a particular kind of illness,
and then you wiped your eyes.

387
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,860
And I've talked about
on this podcast before,

388
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,890
very soon after we meet another person,

389
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,230
usually within 30 seconds,
believe it or not,

390
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,710
most people wipe that person's chemicals

391
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,030
somewhere on their face or
on their body's surface.

392
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,790
This has been demonstrated
over and over again.

393
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,840
If you want to learn more about that,

394
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,820
we did an episode all
about chemical signaling,

395
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,680
where you can learn about it.

396
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
I know it sounds weird and you
might say, "I don't do that,"

397
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,240
but indeed you do, most of
the time most everybody does.

398
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,240
Okay, so, this innate immune
system is this rapid response

399
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,630
when something enters our system

400
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,960
and our body doesn't recognize it.

401
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,900
It's not food, it's not clean air,

402
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,190
it's something that's either
a bacteria, virus or parasite.

403
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,020
And the innate immune
system involves the release

404
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,020
of particular cells that
are waiting dormant,

405
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,680
ready to attack whatever this invader is.

406
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,520
And some of these cell types
you've heard of before.

407
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,780
The most typical one are the
so-called white blood cells.

408
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,890
So, the white blood cells
will actively go to the site

409
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,750
of invasion and will start to encapsulate

410
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,040
or try and surround that given invader.

411
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,750
The other names of these
different cell types

412
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,160
are things like neutrophils, macrophages,

413
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,600
natural killer cells are just a few

414
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,610
of the many types of immune cells.

415
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,020
So there's kind of like
an ambulance system,

416
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,210
but rather than go and
try and heal something

417
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,450
like a paramedic would,
they go there and they try

418
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,473
and surround and kill
whatever this invader is.

419
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,750
They work in concert with
two other assistants,

420
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,210
and those assistants are
called the compliment proteins.

421
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,240
Compliment proteins exist in the blood,

422
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,830
and what they do is they travel to sites

423
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,870
where there's an invasion
and they mark certain things

424
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,210
for being engulfed and eaten.

425
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,163
So they sort of put an "eat me" tag on it.

426
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,260
They basically put a
chemical tag onto invaders

427
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,390
that then allows those white
blood cells, neutrophils,

428
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,907
macrophages, natural killer cells to say,

429
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:19,610
"Ah, I need to basically kill this thing,

430
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,530
and then wrap it in a
body bag and send it off.

431
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,550
Kill that thing, wrap in a
body bag and send it off."

432
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,510
And I'm using the analogy of the body bag,

433
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:29,420
but in the sense it's the right one rather

434
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,820
because these cells that
come in and kill things,

435
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,390
the way they do that is actually to engulf

436
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,760
the invading bacteria, virus or parasite.

437
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,090
So they actually surround it.

438
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,930
And when you see puss or you see infection

439
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,450
in maybe a cut on the skin
or something like that,

440
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,760
or even in an ingrown hair
that gets some bacteria in it,

441
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,040
that puss and the white part,

442
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,270
I know it's kind of gross to talk about,

443
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,083
but those are the white blood cells,

444
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
oftentimes it's dead cells,

445
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,450
and that's the dead invader sitting there.

446
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,720
So it's trying to create
an isolated compartment

447
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,590
'cause it wants to keep it
in that part of the body.

448
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,010
Okay, so you've got the
innate immune system,

449
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,170
the compliment comes
through blood and helps it

450
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,890
by tagging certain things
with an "eat me" signal.

451
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,760
And then there are the cells
that are either damaged

452
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,140
from the injury or from the parasite,

453
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,840
or are suffering because of the bacteria

454
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,160
or the virus itself, and
the cells of your body

455
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,910
will also release an alarm signal,

456
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,750
which is not an "eat me"
signal, but a "help me" signal.

457
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,890
And those "help me"
signals come in the form

458
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,810
of what we call cytokines.

459
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,480
And the cytokines are
things like interleukin-1,

460
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,650
interleukin-6, tumor
necrosis factor alpha.

461
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,310
You may have heard of these
things if you are at all curious

462
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,500
about or have been learning
about the health space,

463
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,590
online health space, especially
in the last few years,

464
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,980
inflammation is all the buzz word now.

465
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,060
Everyone's talking about inflammation,

466
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,330
inflammation, inflammation.

467
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,410
What do we mean when we say inflammation?

468
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,830
Well, inflammation is a physical response,

469
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,100
but it's also a chemical response.

470
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,610
And many times the markers of
inflammation that are measured

471
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,090
in people or in animal models
where this research is done,

472
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,120
are things like
interleukin-1, interleukin-6,

473
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,750
tumor necrosis factor alpha.

474
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,390
So when those go up in the blood,

475
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,530
it's a sign that somewhere there's a cell

476
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,870
that's saying "help me, help me."

477
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,550
And is secreting these
things which calls in

478
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,990
those neutrophils, macrophages,
natural killer cells,

479
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,870
and white blood cells, okay?

480
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,023
And it might help to remember all this,

481
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:34,240
by just telling people
that what interleukin means

482
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,570
is to communicate, right?

483
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,560
So the interleukin is
shouting out "help me,"

484
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,497
the compliment proteins
are coming in and saying,

485
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:44,330
"eat this" and tagging the
invader with an "eat me" signal.

486
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,870
And then the killer cells
and the white blood cells

487
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,350
are doing the job of trying
to kill off that thing.

488
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,180
That's the innate immune system.

489
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,100
So, your skin and your mucus lining

490
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,970
plus your innate immune system
are a beautiful two-layered

491
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,560
set of defenses against various kinds

492
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,590
of invaders and infections.

493
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,120
And then there's the third type,

494
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,060
which is the adaptive immune system.

495
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,350
And you'll notice that
leading up until now,

496
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,090
I haven't said the word antibody at all,

497
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,040
and that's because it is
the job not of the skin

498
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,280
or the mucus or the microbiome
or the innate immune system

499
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,880
to produce antibodies that can
recognize specific invaders,

500
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,200
but rather it is the job of
the adaptive immune system

501
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,770
to create antibodies
against bacteria, viruses,

502
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,550
and even parasites and
even physical intruders

503
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,910
to your system.

504
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,360
So, the adaptive immune system
has this incredible ability

505
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
to show up at the site of invasion

506
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,560
or infection or inflammation.

507
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,450
It's called there by various cues,

508
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,410
including the cytokines that
we talked about earlier.

509
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,410
And what it does is it
actually attaches to

510
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,720
and creates a sort of
an imprint of the shape

511
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,440
of whatever invader happens to be there.

512
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,620
So if that particular
invading bacteria or virus

513
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,750
has a contour that's kind
of rippled or kind of spiky

514
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,160
or whatever shape it happens to have,

515
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,390
it creates an imprint of that.

516
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,820
And then, using that imprint in concert

517
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,450
with some other cells, creates
antibodies that are specific

518
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,260
to recognize that invader should the body

519
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,210
ever have that invader inside of it again.

520
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,810
Now, that's why it's called
the adaptive immune system.

521
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,810
And in many ways it creates
a memory of a prior infection

522
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,590
so that these antibodies
can be made anytime

523
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,683
that same invader comes
back again, all right?

524
00:22:44,683 --> 00:22:47,900
And so, this is the basis
of what we call immunity.

525
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,610
This is the basis of what
we call an enhanced ability

526
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,100
to combat certain types of infections.

527
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,680
And it's really a wonderful, and I mean,

528
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,840
I can't even state how
incredible this really is,

529
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,690
that all of our bodies
have this capacity, right?

530
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,173
We have something called leukocytes.

531
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,770
These are essentially white blood cells.

532
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,640
We have red blood cells
and white blood cells,

533
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,370
and they both are derived from
the same type of origin cell.

534
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,560
It's a stem cell.

535
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,820
When you hear stem cell,
a stem cell just means

536
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,330
a cell that can become many
different types of other cells.

537
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,860
We sometimes hear about stem
cells in terms of people

538
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,870
that are getting injections of stem cells

539
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,930
or the potential therapeutic effects

540
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,970
or potential of stem cells.

541
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,250
But we all harbor certain
stem cells within us as well,

542
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,040
that can become lots of
different cell types.

543
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,130
And there's one particular
type of stem cell,

544
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,090
which is the hematopoietic stem cell,

545
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,990
which can give rise to red blood cells

546
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,420
and white blood cells.

547
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,000
And in general, these
reside in the marrow,

548
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,210
at least in adults.

549
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,400
So, in our bone marrow,

550
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,210
we have this ability to make certain cells

551
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,440
that can go out when they
are called out chemically,

552
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,070
they get called out to sites of infection

553
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,750
and create antibodies,

554
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,700
and then maintain those
antibodies in our system,

555
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,980
or have a memory of that
particular infection

556
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,090
so that if the infection comes back again,

557
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,660
we can kill it off immediately.

558
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,720
And it doesn't have to pass
through these multiple stages

559
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,130
of first, the innate response,

560
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,630
then the adaptive
response, taking some time.

561
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,770
Now, there are a lot more details

562
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,410
to the adaptive immune system,

563
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,640
but I just want to emphasize a few points

564
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,430
that might be relevant.

565
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,700
First of all, the name of the antibodies

566
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,100
that are created
sometimes come in the form

567
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,820
of IgM and IgG, things of that sort.

568
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,560
This isn't a full deep
dive immunology class,

569
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,470
but Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay?

570
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,330
So the immunoglobulins are a part of

571
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,773
the adaptive immune response
in creating antibodies.

572
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:54,610
If you hear IgM, the IgM is the first

573
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,270
of the adaptive immune responses,

574
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,790
and it tends to come on earlier.

575
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,050
So if somebody is immunopositive for IgM

576
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,420
for a particular type of
viral or bacterial invader,

577
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,083
that means that it was a
fairly recent infection.

578
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,200
Later, one creates...

579
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,100
The adaptive immune system,
I should say, creates an IgG,

580
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,020
which is the more stable
form of the specific antibody

581
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,870
that's going to recognize a given invader.

582
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,930
So IgG tends to come
up a little bit later.

583
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,140
So, just to recap,

584
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,900
something gets into your
system through your eyes,

585
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,773
through some hole in your skin,
a cut, through your mouth,

586
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,670
sexually transmitted
diseases come in through

587
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,210
the mucus membranes that
are on the genitalia

588
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,563
or in the genitalia,

589
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,790
sexually transmitted
disease, airborne disease,

590
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,930
gets into the mucus, somehow
gets into the bloodstream.

591
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,350
Then there's the innate response,

592
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,010
which is a more general
response of trying to contain

593
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,260
and combat the infection or invader.

594
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,040
And then the adaptive response is the one

595
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,280
that generates the antibodies.

596
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,550
First, the IgM response, the
immunoglobulin-M response,

597
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:07,060
and then the immunoglobulin-G
response, IgG response.

598
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,670
So, how do we keep these three barriers

599
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,950
or these three defense
systems to infection tuned up?

600
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,670
Well, leaving aside the list of things

601
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,670
that I mentioned before that generally

602
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,790
enhances their function,

603
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,910
things like sleep and
sunlight and good nutrition,

604
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,600
et cetera, the sort of generic
things for good health,

605
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,140
one of the key ways we
can do that is to keep

606
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,070
that mucus lining in really good shape.

607
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,903
And what does that mean?

608
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:36,410
Well, the mucus lining needs
to turn over quite often

609
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,970
and it needs to be the
correct chemistry to be a trap

610
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,810
for the bad stuff and
for it to be permeable

611
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,270
to the good stuff, to the
nutrients that we need.

612
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,580
And it is now very clear from hundreds,

613
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,020
if not thousands of studies
that the best way to do that

614
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,380
is to maintain a healthy
so-called microbiome.

615
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,740
The microbiome being these
little bacterial organisms

616
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,640
that are good for us that live
all along our mucus pathways

617
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,060
and even in our eyes.

618
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,460
Now, just to be really clear,

619
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,600
it's not just about the gut microbiome;

620
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,930
we actually have a microbiome in our eyes,

621
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,560
we have one that's specific to our mouth,

622
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,360
we have a nasal specific microbiome,

623
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,010
there's one all along the gut
and the species of microbiota

624
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,270
that live all along the digestive tract

625
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,500
differ from the mouth, to
the throat, to the stomach,

626
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,180
intestines, into the rectum.

627
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,760
It's well-established that
there are healthy microbiota

628
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,280
that live all along that length,

629
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,780
and that they differ along that length.

630
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,800
There's also a urethral microbiota,

631
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,500
and there's a vaginal
microbiota that promotes health

632
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,210
of that environment as well.

633
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,570
So how is it that one can
maintain the healthy microbiota

634
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,980
and not favor growth of harmful bacteria,

635
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,870
or allow that mucus lining
to become too permeable

636
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,780
to the bad stuff that can
come in from the environment?

637
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,000
Well, as far as we know,

638
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,700
there are three main ways to do that.

639
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,943
The first two are purely
structural and mechanical.

640
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,880
It's very clear now from work,

641
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,250
some of which was done at
Stanford, but elsewhere as well,

642
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,710
that the nasal microbiome
is particularly good

643
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,870
at scrubbing bacteria,

644
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,210
at preventing certain types of infections.

645
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,960
So, this is a reminder
that whenever possible,

646
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,730
unless eating or speaking, you
want to be nasal breathing,

647
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,160
not breathing through your mouth.

648
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,500
Your nose is a much
better filter for viruses

649
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,520
and bacteria than is your mouth.

650
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,980
The mouth contains certain
structural features,

651
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,210
even organs and cell
types that can protect

652
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,860
against incoming infection,

653
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,770
but you don't want to be a mouth breather

654
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,100
for a variety of reasons.

655
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,407
And there's a terrific book called

656
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:51,620
"Jaws: A Hidden Epidemic,"

657
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,780
which was written by my colleagues,

658
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,970
Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford,

659
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,530
and Stanford Medicine with a foreword

660
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,760
by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

661
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,480
So it's really a lot of
heavy hitters on that book

662
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,090
that talks about the increase in infection

663
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,620
that one gets when
breathing through the mouth,

664
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,690
as opposed to the nose.

665
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,510
Now, of course, during hard exercise,

666
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,570
one breathes through the mouth,

667
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,290
that's not necessarily bad.

668
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,690
When one is eating or speaking,

669
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,440
that's not necessarily bad at all.

670
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,000
I guess it depends on what you're saying.

671
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,900
That was a joke.

672
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,250
But in general, when possible you want

673
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,690
to be breathing through your nose.

674
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,700
Many people have trouble
breathing through their nose

675
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,500
because of so-called deviated septums

676
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,830
or chronically collapsed sinuses.

677
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,230
The best way to dilate
those sinuses is actually

678
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,240
to breathe through your nose.

679
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,480
So it can take a little bit of time,

680
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,860
but there is some
plasticity to the sinuses.

681
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,640
And so, be a nose breather,
not a mouth breather,

682
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,590
you will combat more of the infections

683
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,140
that you are constantly confronted with.

684
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,280
I should mention that
we are always bombarded

685
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,080
with different types of bacteria, viruses,

686
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,590
and parasites in our environment.

687
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,220
And the goal of course,

688
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,410
is to reinforce your immune system,

689
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,503
so you can keep these things
at bay and not get sick.

690
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,580
There's actually a
paper that was published

691
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,100
in Cell Reports, "Cell Press Journal,"

692
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,230
excellent journal that showed
that the nasal microbiome,

693
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,070
it has particular species of microbiota

694
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,403
that are good at fighting off infection.

695
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,430
There has not been a direct
link between particular patterns

696
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,230
of nasal breathing and
the nasal microbiome yet,

697
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,130
but oxygenation of that environment

698
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,520
by breathing through your nose,

699
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,020
turns out to be quite important overall

700
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,950
for enhancing it as a filter.

701
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,940
So don't just think of
your nose as something

702
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,820
to smell foods and to bring in air.

703
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,730
It's also an active filter for
things that could invade you.

704
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,920
The other way to try
and keep out bad things

705
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,470
and to avoid getting sick is
the advice that your mother,

706
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,280
and certainly my mother gave me,

707
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,280
which is to not touch your eyes
after touching other people

708
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,470
or touching other surfaces.

709
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,530
And as I mentioned earlier,

710
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,760
we tend to do this subconsciously.

711
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,170
But the reason to avoid
doing that is the eyes

712
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,380
are a primary entry point for
a lot of bacteria and viruses.

713
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,440
You're constantly lubricating
the surface of your eyes

714
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,020
with the so-called lacrimal glands,

715
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,720
and tears and things of that sort.

716
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,260
If you've ever noticed when
you wake up in the morning,

717
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,197
you have some sleep in your eyes,

718
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:11,280
you know the kind of crusty stuff

719
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,470
in the corners of your
eyes or on your eyelashes,

720
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,170
that sleep, that crust
are actually dead bacteria

721
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,740
that you've successfully
battled during the night.

722
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,573
Okay, that's what that is.

723
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:26,660
It's not the accumulation
of some healthy tissue.

724
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,120
It's the accumulation of that
your healthy mucus membranes

725
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,390
and tears and other things
that are specifically

726
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,400
combating those bacteria.

727
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,090
So, I know that sounds a little bit gross,

728
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,950
but that's what that is.

729
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,350
So you're wiping away the
casualties of a battle

730
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,080
that you fought at night.

731
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,860
So during the daytime, you
don't want to introduce viruses

732
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,130
and things to your eyes
as much as possible.

733
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,700
It is a primary site of entry.

734
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,920
This is why people wear
goggles in surgical units

735
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,470
and things of that sort,

736
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,870
to try and avoid getting
things into their eyes.

737
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,050
Very, very important.

738
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,750
And then the third way to
keep a healthy line of defense

739
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,750
for your entire mucus tract is to enhance

740
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,200
the proliferation of good gut microbiota.

741
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,040
The best way to enhance the
quality of your gut microbiome

742
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,050
and the mucus lining that
serves as this protective layer

743
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,560
all along your body is to ingest
two to four servings a day

744
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,210
of fermented foods, low
sugar fermented foods.

745
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,880
I've talked about this
before a bunch of times

746
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,180
on the podcast, but these
are data from my colleague,

747
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,640
Justin Sonnenburg's lab at Stanford Med.

748
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,160
And there, I just wiped my eyes.

749
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,093
Yep, you got me.

750
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,520
But a paper published
in the journal "Cell,"

751
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,820
which is a absolutely spectacular journal,

752
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,870
really points to the fact that when

753
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,210
people eat fermented foods,
two to four servings per day,

754
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,540
it helps reduce the activity
of certain cytokines.

755
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,940
Now, you know what those are, right?

756
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,610
Cells make cytokines to call
out, "help me, help me."

757
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,190
To reduce the amount of cytokines,

758
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,450
the so-called inflammatom.

759
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,490
Now that doesn't render
those cells more vulnerable.

760
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,190
The reason they saw a
reduction in IL-6 and IL-1,

761
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,430
and some of these other cytokines

762
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,370
is because when people have
a healthy gut microbiome,

763
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,110
there are fewer cells in
the body being infected

764
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,090
from outside infections and
therefore less of a reason

765
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,490
for cells to be crying out, "help,"

766
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,630
because they are thriving, not suffering.

767
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:26,280
So, don't wipe your eyes,
keep your hands clean,

768
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,240
everyone tells you that, right?

769
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,160
But keep your hands clean,
don't wipe your eyes,

770
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,260
be a nasal breather, not a mouth breather,

771
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,900
unless you're speaking,
exercising or eating,

772
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,250
and keep a healthy gut microbiome

773
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,190
by eating two to four servings
a day of quality, low sugar,

774
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,000
fermented foods, things like sauerkraut,

775
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,930
things like natto if you can access that.

776
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,960
I've tried it before, it's interesting.

777
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,620
It's sort of an acquired
taste, kimchi, pickles,

778
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,360
again, low sugar sources
are going to be the sources

779
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,910
that are going to be
most effective for this.

780
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,570
So now you're armed with three
ways to enhance the function

781
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,280
of your immune system and
combat infection that is,

782
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,050
I like to think separate from the typical

783
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,610
type of information that you
get such as get good sleep,

784
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,560
good nutrition, good social
connection, et cetera.

785
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,860
All of that stuff still holds true,

786
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,360
but these three other points
I think can really make

787
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,920
a substantial difference
in terms of bolstering

788
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,750
the immune system, your immune system.

789
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,010
I do want to mention,
because these names are going

790
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,790
to come up several times
during this episode,

791
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:30,366
that while interleukins like IL-6 and IL-1

792
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:33,460
encourage inflammation, they
are these "help me" signals

793
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,860
that call in cells to gobble up invaders.

794
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,480
There are some interleukins
that are anti-inflammatory.

795
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,550
And the one that I'd like
to highlight in particular,

796
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,570
because it will come up
again in a little bit

797
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,250
is interleukin-10.

798
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,969
So not all of the IL, insert number,

799
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,499
not all of the interleukins
are inflammatory,

800
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,900
some are anti-inflammatory.

801
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,330
So that's an important
point to keep in mind

802
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,429
as we go forward.

803
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,720
Next, I'd like to talk about

804
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,750
what's called sickness behavior.

805
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,620
And indeed there is a category of behavior

806
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,860
that we call sickness behavior
that is very informative

807
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,950
as to the things that we can
do to avoid getting sick.

808
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,650
Now, this notion of sickness behavior

809
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,010
goes back several decades or more.

810
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,300
And it's a very interesting way of looking

811
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,520
at the function of the immune system,

812
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,430
because what it does is it
bridges us from this thing

813
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,200
that we're calling the immune
system where it's T-cells,

814
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,280
and B-cells, and cytokines and leukocytes,

815
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,760
and it starts taking us into the realm

816
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,593
of the nervous system,

817
00:35:32,593 --> 00:35:35,670
because of course the nervous
system controls behavior.

818
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:40,080
So sickness behavior
is a suite of responses

819
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,220
that we tend to all undergo
when we are feeling sick.

820
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,690
So this is going to vary
from person to person,

821
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,410
but there's some general
categories of things

822
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,220
that we all do and that
happen to all of us

823
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,210
after we are wounded or sick

824
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,050
or dealing with an infection of any kind.

825
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,540
And by examining sickness
behavior in some detail,

826
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,470
it can be really informative as to routes

827
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,030
that we can take to health.

828
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,010
So the main thing about sickness behavior

829
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,570
is that it tends to involve a slowing

830
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,580
of our usual levels of activity.

831
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,640
People start to feel lethargic,

832
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,680
or they feel like the
activities that previously

833
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,610
they could do with relative ease

834
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,450
are very difficult for them
or somewhat overwhelming.

835
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,160
The other thing you start to
see is that people and animals,

836
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,400
by the way, stop grooming,

837
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,930
they stop taking care of themselves.

838
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,340
Not necessarily stopped showering,

839
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,680
although oftentimes that's the case,

840
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,310
but they will stop doing their hair,

841
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,923
they'll stop putting on makeup,

842
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,930
depending on whether or
not they did that before,

843
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,763
they might stop.

844
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:43,100
Animals will stop licking
and grooming themselves.

845
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,800
People will stop taking care
of their cosmetic appearance.

846
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,340
Now it's not just because they don't care

847
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,460
how they look when they're sick,

848
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,320
it's because there's
this overall suppression

849
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,930
of certain kinds of
activities and an enhancement

850
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,070
of other kinds of activities.

851
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,270
And this is really important.

852
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:03,010
Sickness behavior is
actually a motivated state.

853
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,760
It's a state that's designed
to accomplish certain things.

854
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,610
One of the other features
of sickness behavior

855
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,160
in addition to being
lethargic, loss of grooming,

856
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,830
will be a loss of appetite, right?

857
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,360
Oftentimes people who have
a great appetite normally

858
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,260
just won't feel hungry at all.

859
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,620
And there are several theories
as to why this would be.

860
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,330
One prominent idea in
the literature is that

861
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,960
it's to discourage vomiting and diarrhea,

862
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,350
which of course can be
infectious to other people.

863
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,120
So, that's a theory.

864
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,540
I don't know that that's
ever been tested directly,

865
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,240
but that's one idea.

866
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,410
The other idea is that it's
simply to harbor more resources

867
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,810
for sake of repair.

868
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,780
And I want to talk about
that because we are all told

869
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,490
to get extra sleep when we
aren't feeling well or to rest.

870
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,720
But just like any good
two or three-year-old

871
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,300
constantly asks, "why, why?"

872
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,430
Good scientists, good
people who are interested

873
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,260
in health information
should always be asking why.

874
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,270
Why should I get more sleep?

875
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,420
What happens in sleep that I should

876
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,550
get more sleep when I'm sick?

877
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,180
Why shouldn't I just push through this?

878
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,330
And there are a couple of reasons for this

879
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,180
that have been established
in the literature.

880
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,550
The first is that there does
seem to be something useful

881
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,870
about slowing circulation when we are ill.

882
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,380
One idea that has some data to support it

883
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,590
is that when we slow our
circulation, our blood circulation,

884
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,950
so not running around so
much or running it all,

885
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,230
but rather lying down, getting
extra rest, maybe sleeping,

886
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,280
maybe even just remaining still,

887
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,430
is that the lymphatic system,

888
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,600
which carries a lot of the
immune-related cells and fluids,

889
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,580
is able to ramp up its levels of activity.

890
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,890
So, this is interesting, right?

891
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,270
So reducing circulation of the blood,

892
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,870
but increasing circulation
of the lymphatic system.

893
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,960
You've all probably been familiar
with the lymphatic system

894
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,670
when you're combating an infection,

895
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,370
your lymph nodes can get sore.

896
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,770
You've got lymph nodes behind your ears,

897
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,950
in your groin, your
armpits, around your throat,

898
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,590
around near your thyroid,
in your throat, et cetera.

899
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,940
So, that's the other reason.

900
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,893
Now, some people, when they get sick,

901
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,850
psychologically go into
a very vulnerable state

902
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,220
where they really, really want people,

903
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,900
other people to take care of them.

904
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,880
You've probably witnessed this,

905
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,330
or you feel this way yourself.

906
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,690
About 50% of people have that response.

907
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,410
They really want to be taken care of.

908
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,020
Now, when you think about it
from an adaptive perspective,

909
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,530
this makes sense, right?

910
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,530
A member of our species is
ill and they more or less

911
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,860
will cry out for help
in one form or another

912
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,240
to the other members of their
species to take care of them.

913
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,360
And of course this will be
especially apparent in cases

914
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,160
where people are young enough
or incapacitated enough

915
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,770
that they can't actually
get resources on their own.

916
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,750
If you've ever been really sick,

917
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,540
just getting up and going to
the fridge or to the restroom

918
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,960
can feel like a monumental task.

919
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,960
So about 50% of people report
or describe seeking of help

920
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,700
and support when they are sick.

921
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,130
But you could also
imagine how this would be

922
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,850
a very non-adaptive response

923
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,170
because it increases the
opportunity to spread infection

924
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,410
to the caretaker.

925
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,243
So that's an interesting consideration.

926
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,770
Another 50% of people seem
to have the opposite response

927
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,603
when they're sick.

928
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:28,170
So, somehow, regardless of how they were

929
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,840
prior to getting ill,

930
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,220
the sickness behavior that's engaged

931
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,080
by these neural circuits in the brain,

932
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,800
they are indeed neural
circuits in the brain,

933
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,680
create a stay away from me.

934
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,700
I don't want to be bothered.

935
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
I want to be left alone.

936
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,280
I don't want to be taken care of, right?

937
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,823
It's not stubbornness.

938
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,970
It's literally a lack of interest

939
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,680
or a disinterest in social
connection when one is sick.

940
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,200
And you see this in animals too,

941
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,960
some animals will seek out
other members of their species.

942
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,730
Others, like my unfortunately now

943
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,580
passed away bulldog, Costello.

944
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,220
When he was sick I always knew
because he would go around

945
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,740
the back of the house and
he would just hide there.

946
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,640
He would just take himself
away from everybody else.

947
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,677
He did not want to be taken care of.

948
00:41:05,677 --> 00:41:07,530
And it was just a natural response to him.

949
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,880
I don't think he was trying to prevent me

950
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,190
from getting whatever it was that he had.

951
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,440
So if ever somebody doesn't
want to be taken care of,

952
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,690
or if they do want to be taken care of,

953
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,350
realize that people tend to fall into

954
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,430
these two bins naturally,

955
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,930
and animals tend to fall into these bins.

956
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,940
Regardless of what species
they are, it's about 50/50.

957
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,510
And again, this sickness
behavior is a motivated state.

958
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,610
It's designed to slow
circulation of the blood,

959
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,560
increase circulation of the lymph,

960
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,360
and the other killer cells in the body,

961
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,130
reduce the probability of
infecting others by reducing,

962
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,060
its thought, diarrhea and vomit,

963
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,260
but also breathing on others,
interacting with others.

964
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,350
And in some cases it will activate this,

965
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,080
I don't want to call it a regressed state,

966
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,685
but many people feel somewhat more...

967
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:55,700
If they are adults,
they feel more childlike

968
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,950
when they are ill and they want

969
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,390
to be taken care of very badly.

970
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,330
Some of it might be learned.

971
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,560
Some of it might be innate.

972
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,080
We don't know, but the sickness
behavior is very interesting

973
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,130
for a couple of reasons.

974
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,170
First of all, it mimics another state

975
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,800
that has been described in
the neuroscience literature,

976
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,593
which is major depression.

977
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,810
And in both sick individuals,

978
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,200
sick from bacterial or viral infection,

979
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,770
and in people with major depression,

980
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,800
it's been shown that
there are robust increases

981
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,760
in the levels of interleukin-6

982
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,840
and tumor necrosis factor alpha.

983
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,530
So there is an idea now circulating
that depression involves

984
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,630
these inflammatory
cytokines being very active.

985
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,830
And we know that illness involves

986
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,230
inflammatory cytokines being very active.

987
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,063
So if you think about it,

988
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,970
the similarity between major
depression and being sick

989
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,990
ought to be able to point us
in a direction of interventions

990
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,710
that could help us either prevent illness

991
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,140
or move through illness more quickly.

992
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,200
But as we head in that direction,

993
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,060
because indeed that's the case,

994
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,770
I just want to emphasize
that sickness behavior

995
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,250
is what provides this bridge
between the immune system

996
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,770
and the nervous system.

997
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,440
And what we'll soon see also
is that healthy behavior,

998
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,700
behavior that allows
us to avoid infection,

999
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,620
also points to a clear bridge between

1000
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,840
the nervous system and the immune system.

1001
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,630
That it isn't just that we have a brain

1002
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,070
and body and our organs, and
then we have an immune system.

1003
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,960
That's true, but they're
interacting all the time.

1004
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,000
And this is going to lead us to a place

1005
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,870
where it's going to be very
clear and not at all surprising

1006
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,820
how certain patterns of
thinking and certain behaviors

1007
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,870
that we can elect to take can help enhance

1008
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,720
our immune system function and vice versa.

1009
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,210
There are two other features
of sickness behavior

1010
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,250
definitely worth pointing out.

1011
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,710
One is a theory, which is
that the reduced appetite,

1012
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,350
in particular appetite for
protein rich foods when sick,

1013
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:58,180
is thought to be an attempt,
a subconscious attempt,

1014
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,610
of the organism to
reduce the amount of iron

1015
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,900
that it's taking in.

1016
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,510
Now, typically the amount of iron intake

1017
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,480
that's recommended or
more or less is for men,

1018
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,790
it's about eight milligrams per day.

1019
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,780
For women, it's anywhere from
18 to 27 milligrams per day,

1020
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,260
depending on whether or
not they're pregnant,

1021
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,133
lactating or menstruating, et
cetera, the ranges can vary.

1022
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,300
But, and indeed, it's
true that if iron levels

1023
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,930
in the blood go too high, like
over 45 milligrams per day

1024
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,950
can be very toxic to the system.

1025
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,760
But the theory that's prominent
in the biology literature

1026
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,070
and in the health literature
is that the reduction

1027
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,570
in appetite is actually an attempt

1028
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,550
to reduce iron intake specifically

1029
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,560
because many bacteria and
other forms of infection

1030
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,567
seem to thrive when levels of
iron in the blood are high.

1031
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,890
And I don't want to see
anyone take this too extreme

1032
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,740
and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet

1033
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,990
in order to get well.

1034
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,200
But it's an interesting
theory that I'd be remiss

1035
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,560
if I didn't mention,
because it makes good sense.

1036
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,830
Iron is actually attached to hemoglobin

1037
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,790
and red blood cells in the bloodstream.

1038
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,260
Normally that can help us quite a lot.

1039
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,160
It's also in muscle,
I should mention that.

1040
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,380
Iron can be a sequestered into muscle,

1041
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:19,130
and iron serves a lot of
important health promoting roles,

1042
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,130
but by reducing appetite and
thereby reducing iron intake,

1043
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,170
it does reduce the
capacity of certain things,

1044
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,420
including infections to
travel in certain compartments

1045
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,610
within the body.

1046
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,360
So, again, that's just theory,

1047
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,630
but I think many of you
are probably familiar

1048
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,533
with not having an
appetite when you're sick.

1049
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,570
The other thing that's
very typical of people

1050
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,210
with major depression is loss of appetite,

1051
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,870
not always but often loss of appetite.

1052
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,760
So, here again, we have loss of appetite

1053
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,590
in sickness behavior, loss of
appetite and major depression,

1054
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,780
and perhaps not surprisingly
one of the major symptoms

1055
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,110
of sickness behavior and major depression

1056
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,920
that map more or less onto one another

1057
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,310
is loss of libido or interest,

1058
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,750
not just in social interactions,

1059
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,340
but in sex and reproduction.

1060
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,820
And so, again, if you think
about sickness behavior

1061
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,950
and depression, they
are very, very similar.

1062
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,780
Okay, so sickness behavior
and major depression

1063
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,343
have certain core features in common.

1064
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,800
We need to therefore ask
ourselves why and how does

1065
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,510
being sick influence the way
that we think and perceive

1066
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,570
our environment and impact our appetite,

1067
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,450
whether or not we want
to be cared for more

1068
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,450
or cared for less?

1069
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:39,070
Again, people tend to diverge
into two different bins there,

1070
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,380
and believe it or not,

1071
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,800
the pathway for this has been identified.

1072
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,330
When we have an infection
someplace in our body,

1073
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,890
and it could be up in our head,

1074
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,940
it could be a sinus infection,
it could be an ear infection,

1075
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,770
or I should also mention
many of these same mechanisms

1076
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,820
can also be the consequence of a wound

1077
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,453
or an injury to the body.

1078
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,700
A back injury or a slipped disc

1079
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,740
or I guess it's called a herniated disc

1080
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,740
is the way that you hear it described.

1081
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,120
When we have that, we
can be kind of irritable,

1082
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,810
we don't want to do certain things

1083
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,940
and we just want to be left alone.

1084
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,810
Things are harder.

1085
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,190
How? Why?

1086
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,960
Well, there's a known pathway,

1087
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,870
which is the so-called vagus nerve

1088
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,390
that connects the body and the brain,

1089
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:29,390
signals to particular brain
sites to engage this category

1090
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,563
of motivational state that
we call sickness behavior.

1091
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,820
Many of you have probably
heard of the vagus,

1092
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,440
V-A-G-U-S, vagus.

1093
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,850
The vagus nerve is a very
extensive nerve pathway,

1094
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,940
as the 10th cranial nerve
comes out of the back

1095
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,040
of the brainstem, heads into the body,

1096
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,560
and branches out extensively to innervate

1097
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,210
or connect to many of our organs,

1098
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,440
including our lungs, our
heart, our gut, et cetera.

1099
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,390
And all of those organs are
able also to send neural signals

1100
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,513
back up to the brain.

1101
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,070
We sometimes hear of
the vagus as the route

1102
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,630
to calming ourselves down.

1103
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,960
Unfortunately, that's more or less a myth

1104
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,000
that I don't know how it got propagated.

1105
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,100
You have lots of different
pathways in the vagus

1106
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,540
Usually vagal stimulation
actually creates more arousal

1107
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,210
and alertness, although it
does have multiple pathways,

1108
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,550
but there have now been
many studies of the vagus

1109
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,940
in various contexts, including
in sickness behavior.

1110
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:30,940
And it's very clear that the
vagus nerve is the fast pathway

1111
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,890
by which an infection in the
body is signaled to the brain,

1112
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,240
to a particular location in the brain

1113
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,430
called the hypothalamus,

1114
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,220
which harbors a lot of
different types of neurons.

1115
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,310
Neurons, for instance,
in the preoptic area

1116
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,290
that increase body
temperature and fever, right?

1117
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,600
That's one of the most important things

1118
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,130
is to increase body temperature,

1119
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,930
it's the body's attempt
to kill off this invader

1120
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,040
because many viruses and many bacteria

1121
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,240
don't survive well at elevated heat.

1122
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,560
That's the function of a fever.

1123
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,190
A fever actually has a functional role.

1124
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,010
So, in biology, we like complicated words,

1125
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,820
so we call anything that
increases body temperature

1126
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,060
or creates a fever, a pyrogen.

1127
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,130
Many years ago, in my undergraduate years,

1128
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,340
I was working on pyrogens,

1129
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,220
injecting something
called lipopolysaccharide

1130
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,910
into the belly, which
then gives you a fever.

1131
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,390
The way it does that is LPS causes

1132
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,040
an inflammation response in the gut.

1133
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,650
The gut doesn't know what is happening.

1134
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,560
The stomach cells don't
know what's happening.

1135
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,900
So they just start secreting
the IL-6, the IL-1,

1136
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,760
all those cytokines, the killer
cells migrate into the gut.

1137
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,320
That's why you sometimes
get a stomach ache

1138
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,960
when you don't feel well, you have a flu,

1139
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,023
or something like it.

1140
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,330
A neural signal, electrical
signals get sent up

1141
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,400
to the hypothalamus.

1142
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,470
The hypothalamus says, oh,
I don't know what's going on

1143
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,560
out there, but there's a
signal something's going on.

1144
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,170
Let's just heat up the body.

1145
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,040
Let's just start cooking
whatever it is out there.

1146
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,840
And of course you don't
want fever to go too high

1147
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,560
because you can kill brain cells.

1148
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,560
But within a particular range
the fever is a functional

1149
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:06,810
and adaptive response, okay?

1150
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,750
So if you're taking drugs
to try and lower the fever

1151
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,180
that might make you feel more comfortable,

1152
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,610
but actually that's limiting
the response that your body

1153
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,920
is creating in order to try
and kill off that invader.

1154
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,960
And again, you don't want
fever to go too high.

1155
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,480
This is going to vary depending on age.

1156
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,060
You can look up online what the tolerable

1157
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,260
ranges are for fever.

1158
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,820
But when you're trying
to lower body temperature

1159
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,400
when you have a fever,

1160
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,850
unless you're heading into
dangerous levels of heating up,

1161
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,920
that's actually the wrong
way to take your system

1162
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,220
if you do indeed want to
kill off that invader.

1163
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,330
Okay, so the vagus nerve
is the quick response.

1164
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,730
It also sends input to areas of the brain

1165
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,240
that change your perception
of the outside world.

1166
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,900
One of the most obvious of these,

1167
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,090
obvious once I tell it to
you, is photophobia, right?

1168
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,490
I love bright sunshine.

1169
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,140
I love bright lights
when I want to be alert.

1170
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,980
We all have different
levels of light sensitivity,

1171
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,810
but most people when they are sick,

1172
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,450
when there's an inflammation
response in the body,

1173
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,670
they feel like bright
lights are kind of aversive.

1174
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,100
They get a well-described
kind of classical photophobia,

1175
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,840
and that's mediated by a
pathway that goes from your eye

1176
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,910
to an area of your thalamus,

1177
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:24,080
called the anterior
nucleus of the thalamus.

1178
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,030
This is work that was
done by Clifford Saper

1179
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,920
at Harvard Medical School.

1180
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,020
It's really beautiful work.

1181
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,620
And then from there up to the
outer lining of the brain,

1182
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,720
which is the meninges just sort of

1183
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,890
on the outside of the brain
where the brain starts

1184
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,420
to interface with some of
the other connective tissues.

1185
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,080
We'll talk more about these later.

1186
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,580
It can actually create a
photophobia and a headache

1187
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,530
when one is ill.

1188
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,729
So, here's the pathway:

1189
00:51:49,729 --> 00:51:51,950
Some invader gets into your system

1190
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,970
'cause you wiped your eyes or
it got in through your mouth.

1191
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,190
You didn't listen to your mother

1192
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,150
and got in through your eyes.

1193
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,233
You're feeling sick.

1194
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,020
Something's going on there.

1195
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,420
You have a stomach ache because of all

1196
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,230
the inflammation there,

1197
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,580
the signal goes up from your vagus nerve.

1198
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,350
You're heating up with a fever.

1199
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,880
You've got photophobia
because you've activated

1200
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,280
this pathway by which what would
normally be tolerable light

1201
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,140
is triggering this thalamic
nucleus, the anterior thalamus,

1202
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,840
that's projecting up to the meninges.

1203
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,170
You got a headache in
response to looking at light.

1204
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,360
It's basically triggering
an overall pathway

1205
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,440
to get you to go into a
quiet, dark place and rest.

1206
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,450
And the last element I'd like
to talk about is the rest.

1207
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,230
There's something that gets
triggered from the body

1208
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,980
to the brain, to the hypothalamus,

1209
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,510
and we think we know which
hypothalamic area it is.

1210
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,780
It's the supraoptic nucleus, we think.

1211
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,300
Supraoptic 'cause it's right above

1212
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,020
your so-called optic chiasm,

1213
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,140
If you want to look up where that is,

1214
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,750
it's right above the roof of your mouth.

1215
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,750
And there are nuclei there that
promote the desire to sleep

1216
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,070
even during the daytime,
what would normally be

1217
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,840
the active phase of your circadian cycle.

1218
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,100
Now, that is really interesting

1219
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,750
because what's happening
here is you've got multiple

1220
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,713
pathways that are saying avoid light,

1221
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,810
reduce your amount of behavior, heat up,

1222
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,250
all the things that are making you sick.

1223
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,670
This is sickness behavior,
and it's going from your body

1224
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,090
to your mind to make
you do the right thing.

1225
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,600
Now there's also a slow pathway

1226
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,120
that's purely mediated by the blood,

1227
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,730
so-called humoral factors.

1228
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,700
Not 'cause they're funny,

1229
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,760
but humoral factors are
factors of the blood.

1230
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,760
As you have an infection
for many hours or days,

1231
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:38,315
the amount of IL-6 and IL-1

1232
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:41,820
and tumor necrosis factor and
other inflammatory cytokines

1233
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,310
is starting to increase
such that the total amount

1234
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,420
in your circulation gets high enough

1235
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,790
and is communicated to the brain.

1236
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:52,740
And it tends to enter the brain through

1237
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,250
a particular type of tissue
that's really interesting

1238
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,950
called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D.

1239
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,700
Choroid is really interesting.

1240
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,150
It's kind of this fluffy tissue

1241
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,300
that sits in your ventricles.

1242
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,200
The ventricles are the
spaces in your brain,

1243
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,140
and the spaces in your
brain have what's called

1244
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,020
cerebral spinal fluid in them.

1245
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,150
The cerebral spinal fluid contains

1246
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,430
a number of important things,

1247
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:16,130
but the choroid starts
releasing and responding

1248
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,690
to these cytokines, the
inflammatory cytokines,

1249
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,360
and then the brain actually
starts to experience

1250
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,380
all sorts of changes in terms
of inflammation to neurons,

1251
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,090
your memory tends to get poor,

1252
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,340
your cognition tends to get poor.

1253
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,030
These are transient things most often.

1254
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,600
Eventually these things will pass,

1255
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,020
but this is deep into sickness

1256
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,390
when you're really feeling lousy.

1257
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,920
You can't read, you can't watch a movie,

1258
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,753
you can't do anything.

1259
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:42,980
So if you ever get sick and you just can't

1260
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,660
be bothered by anything,

1261
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,420
it's probably because you've
had that fast response

1262
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:50,360
from the body and you've
also had the slower response

1263
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,940
where you literally have a
set of tissues in your brain

1264
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,300
that are sending out these
inflammatory signals.

1265
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,920
And now your whole brain
is starting to cope,

1266
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,920
or is trying to cope with this infection.

1267
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,320
So you've got a slow
pathway and a fast pathway.

1268
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,530
That all sounds really terrible.

1269
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:10,070
So, now, I'd like to talk
about what you can do to reduce

1270
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,550
the probability of getting sick.

1271
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,630
And there are actually
things that one can do

1272
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:19,160
as you start to get sick
and once you're sick,

1273
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,350
to accelerate the healing
process by flipping the equation.

1274
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,240
Up until now we've been
talking about how the body

1275
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,610
activates certain areas
in the brain to create

1276
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,960
sickness behavior that's
very much like depression.

1277
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,630
You're probably all familiar
with this from anytime

1278
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,790
you've had a cold or a flu
or something really lousy

1279
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:35,930
or an injury.

1280
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:40,530
Now, let's flip the equation
and ask what can we do

1281
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,040
with our nervous system
in order to enhance

1282
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,940
the function of our immune
system in order to be able

1283
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,590
to heal and recover from
illness and injury more quickly.

1284
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,650
So let's say you are in that
unfortunate circumstance

1285
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:57,040
of waking up one day or coming home,

1286
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,990
and you've got that tickle in your throat,

1287
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,520
or when you breathe,

1288
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,800
your nasal passages
don't feel the same way.

1289
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,860
You've got a little bit of a headache.

1290
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,210
You're feeling kind of off.

1291
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,360
We all know what we should do.

1292
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,090
We should all hydrate, drink
some water and go to sleep.

1293
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,380
Right, that's we are all told,

1294
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,210
but there are actually things
that you can actively do

1295
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:22,700
in order to get your immune
system to deploy a more robust

1296
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,700
response at that early phase
of potential infection.

1297
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,793
Let's focus first on the rest component.

1298
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,990
Yes, of course we are all
told that we should take

1299
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,790
a hot shower and go to sleep,

1300
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,720
and get nine or 10 hours of sleep.

1301
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,320
But there's an interesting
way of looking at sleep,

1302
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,130
specifically for its role in
enhancing the immune system.

1303
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:49,790
And there's a wonderful review,

1304
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:54,250
I'll put the review in the
captions that looked specifically

1305
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:59,250
at the literature surrounding
sleep that is different

1306
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:02,750
because it occurs in support
of the immune system.

1307
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,180
So normally when we go to sleep,

1308
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,660
we have slow-wave sleep predominantly

1309
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,960
in the early phase of the night,

1310
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,190
and then over time as we
sleep longer and longer,

1311
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:11,360
we get more so-called REM,
rapid eye movement sleep.

1312
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,250
I talked all about this
on the episodes on sleep.

1313
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,250
Of course you have slow-wave
sleep and REM sleep

1314
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,490
throughout the night always,

1315
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,010
but it's the fraction of slow-wave sleep

1316
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:20,620
to REM sleep that shifts,

1317
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,923
and they have different
functions, et cetera.

1318
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,090
There is some evidence
that the sleep associated

1319
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:31,710
with an infection, in particular,
early stage of infection,

1320
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:36,280
is associated with elevated
levels of serotonin in the brain

1321
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,170
that either through an adaptive mechanism

1322
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:41,570
or for whatever reason,
the neurons in the brain

1323
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:44,260
of the so-called raphe nucleus start

1324
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,423
releasing more serotonin.

1325
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,320
And that serotonin and
its related pathways

1326
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,870
can help enhance some of
the immune system function

1327
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,190
that could combat the infection.

1328
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:59,590
There is starting to be some data,

1329
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,620
and I emphasize starting because it's not

1330
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,520
a very robust literature yet,

1331
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,560
looking at whether or not
supplementing precursors

1332
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,340
to serotonin like 5-HTP,

1333
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,520
which can be taken in a supplement form

1334
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,520
or consuming foods that
increase serotonin naturally.

1335
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,740
So these would be any foods that contain

1336
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,830
high levels of tryptophan.

1337
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,000
You can look up what those are.

1338
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,200
So, white meat turkey, for instance,

1339
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,530
certain complex carbohydrates can often

1340
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,490
be rich with tryptophan.

1341
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,080
That consuming those foods can enhance

1342
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,947
the amount of serotonin
that's available in the brain

1343
00:58:34,947 --> 00:58:37,970
and blood and thereby
lead to the particular

1344
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:41,470
quality of sleep that
allows for more deep healing

1345
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,280
or for when I say deep healing,

1346
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,210
I mean for a more robust immune response.

1347
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,920
Now, again, those are still emerging data.

1348
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,070
What is very clear, however,

1349
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,560
is that during sleep and in particular,

1350
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,940
during sleep that's associated
with the early stage

1351
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,660
of any kind of viral
or bacterial infection,

1352
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,720
the so-called glymphatic
system is much more active

1353
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,060
than it would be normally.

1354
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,450
What's the glymphatic system?

1355
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:07,830
The glymphatic system is actually

1356
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,540
a relatively recent discovery.

1357
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,050
I mentioned lymph and the
lymphatic system earlier,

1358
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:18,550
the glymphatic system with a
G, is a system in the brain

1359
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,270
by which debris that
accumulates throughout the day,

1360
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:25,730
but in particular, debris that
accumulates under conditions

1361
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,860
of neuroinflammation and
inflammation of the body,

1362
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,130
is cleared out or is
washed out of the brain.

1363
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,290
And the activity of this glymphatic system

1364
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,390
is extremely important for the recovery

1365
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,810
from infection of any kind.

1366
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,280
And it's now becoming clear,
is important for recovery

1367
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,860
from traumatic head injury,

1368
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,913
and maybe even from psychological trauma.

1369
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,720
So, the glymphatic system can
be thought of more or less

1370
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,200
as a plumbing system that
runs through the ventricles,

1371
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,060
but also mainly through
the lining that sits

1372
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,710
between the brain and the skull

1373
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:03,050
and some of the other tissues
and things of that sort.

1374
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,200
The choroid is involved as well.

1375
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,250
Brain imaging reveals
the glymphatic system

1376
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,690
is very active during deep sleep.

1377
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,440
And there's this kind of wash
out of the glymphatic system.

1378
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,490
And I am aware of some
studies that are ongoing now

1379
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:18,260
where augmenting the serotonin
system through either

1380
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,700
supplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP

1381
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,630
or even serotonin itself,
these are laboratory studies,

1382
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,210
is being looked at for
its capacity to increase

1383
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:30,020
the amount of circulation
in the glymphatic system.

1384
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,900
And the idea is that it might,
and I want to underscore might,

1385
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,690
potentially lead to more
rapid recovery from injury

1386
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:40,080
and illness and potentially
ramp up, if you will,

1387
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,870
the activity of the immune system.

1388
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,260
So, it essentially is a
ramping up of the activity

1389
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,350
of the immune system.

1390
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,690
Now, regardless of whether
or not you decide to,

1391
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:52,100
for instance, supplement with
5-HTP before sleep or not,

1392
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,310
I'll talk about what that
might look like in a moment,

1393
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,480
there is a way that you
can increase the activity

1394
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,200
of your glymphatic system
under normal circumstances.

1395
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,700
Because of the mechanics
of the glymphatic system,

1396
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,740
it turns out that if
you elevate your heels

1397
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,050
by about 12 degrees, it
doesn't have to be exactly 12,

1398
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,040
as you sleep by putting
maybe a rolled pillow

1399
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,840
or two pillows underneath your feet,

1400
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,500
by having the head below your legs.

1401
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,130
It seems that there's
more glymphatic washout

1402
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,000
or clearance during sleep.

1403
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,630
And this is without taking any compound

1404
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,190
to adjust the serotonin system.

1405
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,470
So I would say if you're not feeling well,

1406
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:28,660
yes, take the hot shower.

1407
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,670
Yes, get into bed and go to sleep,

1408
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,630
but elevate your feet to try and increase

1409
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,693
the activity of the glymphatic system.

1410
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:41,140
Some might even consider
that if you have to be awake,

1411
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,470
that you might want to be awake

1412
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,040
with your feet elevated above your head.

1413
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,010
Now that might not be
practical for the workplace,

1414
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,940
but it might be practical for
a short nap during the day

1415
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:51,820
or something of that sort.

1416
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,310
The glymphatic system is not
just active during sleep.

1417
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,460
It's also active during
certain phases of waking,

1418
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,020
in particular when we are in
a deep state of relaxation.

1419
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,240
So as many of you probably
know I'm a big proponent

1420
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,020
of self-hypnosis because of the quality

1421
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,300
scientific literature on this.

1422
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,880
If you're interested in self-hypnosis,

1423
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,000
you can go to Reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

1424
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,020
Reverie is a cost-free
app for Apple and Android

1425
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,140
that was developed by my
colleague, David Spiegel,

1426
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,410
and others at the Stanford
University School of Medicine,

1427
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:23,290
based on quality studies
and peer reviewed data,

1428
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,830
showing that deep states
of relaxation can be used

1429
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,990
to improve pain management,

1430
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,507
improve transition time to sleep,

1431
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:32,450
and a number of other things.

1432
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:35,900
You can select the
various sort of outcomes

1433
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,130
that you're seeking using Reverie.

1434
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,130
It's a great thing especially for people

1435
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,360
that are challenged with
meditation could use,

1436
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,590
because you just listened to the script.

1437
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,120
It involves deep relaxation.

1438
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,870
I would suggest using that
script, or the script for sleep,

1439
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,840
but with feet elevated
to increase activity

1440
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,070
of the glymphatic system.

1441
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:56,060
Now, if you do decide
that you want to test out

1442
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,210
this serotonin hypothesis on your own,

1443
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,570
obviously check with a doctor.

1444
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:00,960
I'm not a doctor, I'm a professor.

1445
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,770
So, I'm professing things,
not suggesting things,

1446
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,650
but 5-HTP is a supplement
that I've talked about before

1447
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:10,390
on this podcast that I
actually do not recommend

1448
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,420
for most people for sake of sleep,

1449
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,970
because it can disrupt the
normal architecture of sleep

1450
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:18,580
and create a deep sleep
early in the night,

1451
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,650
and then a spontaneous
waking with some trouble

1452
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,810
to get back to sleep.

1453
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,880
And that's because of the
way that the serotonin system

1454
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,950
and the melatonin system interact.

1455
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,920
However, under conditions
where one is feeling

1456
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,240
like they might have an infection

1457
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,580
or an early stage of illness,

1458
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,820
in that case, 5-HTP might
be a useful supplement

1459
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,250
in order to access these states of sleep

1460
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,750
that are not typical.

1461
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,860
They're not the typical deep
sleep that you would achieve

1462
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,920
when you're feeling healthy.

1463
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,180
These are states of sleep
that are specifically there

1464
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,460
in order to try and repair
some of the immune system

1465
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,610
related inflammation that's occurring.

1466
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:55,750
If you'd like to explore
the 5-HTP approach

1467
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,830
and you feel it's right and safe for you,

1468
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,580
and you've talked to your doctor,

1469
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:03,460
it's 300 to 500 milligrams
taken about 30 to 60 minutes

1470
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:06,400
before going to sleep for the night.

1471
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,620
That's the typical protocol.

1472
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:13,620
Not incidentally,
increasing serotonin is also

1473
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,130
one typical approach for the
treatment of major depression.

1474
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,950
This is the basis for things like SSRIs,

1475
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,880
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

1476
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,470
like Prozac and Zoloft, and so forth.

1477
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,910
The 5-HTP approach is
a much milder approach

1478
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,550
than prescription drug, of course,

1479
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,050
but will allow more serotonin

1480
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:37,430
to be synthesized and/or released.

1481
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:40,520
Now, for those of you that are
interested in learning more

1482
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,170
about the glymphatic system,
it's a fascinating system,

1483
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,870
and you might want to do a deep dive there

1484
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,410
in terms of the behavioral protocols,

1485
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,243
and what's known about it,

1486
01:04:47,243 --> 01:04:49,947
there's a wonderful article called

1487
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:52,610
"The Glymphatic System:
A Beginner's Guide."

1488
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,040
This is a scientific article.

1489
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,550
The first author is Jessen is
the last name, J-E-S-S-E-N.

1490
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:02,010
If you put in "Jessen,
The Glymphatic System:

1491
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,990
A Beginner's Guide," you
can access the full length

1492
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,340
manuscript easily online.

1493
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,290
It'll show up immediately in your search.

1494
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:11,170
And in a really interesting way,

1495
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:14,520
the glymphatic system
has now also been tied

1496
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,250
to the iron deposition system.

1497
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,220
Earlier we were talking
about iron and how,

1498
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,720
of course, getting enough
dietary iron is important,

1499
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,980
but if levels of iron are too high

1500
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,170
it isn't good for a number of reasons.

1501
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,960
There's a very interesting article

1502
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,647
that just came out last year called

1503
01:05:30,647 --> 01:05:34,610
"Dysfunction of the glymphatic
system might be related

1504
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:38,020
to iron deposition in
the normal aging brain."

1505
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,960
So, we're starting to see these links

1506
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,670
between iron levels being too high,

1507
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:47,670
the glymphatic system not being
active enough and so forth,

1508
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,570
leading to sickness
behavior, inflammation,

1509
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:54,120
and maybe even damage to
neurons associated with aging.

1510
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,060
We can flip that on its
head and say that increasing

1511
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,950
the activity of the glymphatic system,

1512
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:01,480
feet elevated during deep sleep,

1513
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,183
maybe even feet elevated
above the head while awake,

1514
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,430
during a nap or doing a Reverie script

1515
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:11,430
once a day or something of that sort,

1516
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,790
could increase the activity
of the glymphatic system,

1517
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:18,790
lowering iron to a point
that's probably below

1518
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,760
the typical intake during
periods of infection,

1519
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,880
perhaps, I should say,

1520
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,520
can enhance the glymphatic
system and vice versa.

1521
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,510
And then you've got this specialized sleep

1522
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:32,750
that's related to sickness behavior

1523
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,520
that seems to have heightened
levels of serotonin

1524
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,867
that might be augmented
by ingesting 5-HTP.

1525
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,940
Again, not on a regular basis.

1526
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,100
I don't suggest that people take compounds

1527
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,040
that increase serotonin
unless it's prescribed

1528
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,577
to you for depression or something,

1529
01:06:50,577 --> 01:06:55,230
but not doing by supplement
with tryptophan or 5-HTP

1530
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,310
on a regular basis, but
only under conditions

1531
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:00,120
where as I mentioned, you
might be starting to feel sick

1532
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,190
or you're coming down with something,

1533
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:03,550
or you're combating
some sort of infection.

1534
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,720
So if we consider the
advice that we typically get

1535
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,610
when we're not feeling
well of take a hot shower,

1536
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,410
get into bed and go to sleep,

1537
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:14,470
and we've now touched on
ways to potentially increase

1538
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,490
the efficacy of the sleep part through

1539
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,520
the glymphatic and the serotonin system.

1540
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,140
What about the take a hot shower part?

1541
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:20,973
Is that good advice?

1542
01:07:20,973 --> 01:07:21,830
Well, it turns out it is,

1543
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,080
and there's actually a
way to do even better.

1544
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,810
There's a study, a very interesting study,

1545
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,680
the title reveals where
I'm going with this,

1546
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,550
it's "Effect of a single
Finnish sauna session

1547
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,300
on white blood cell profile
and cortisol levels."

1548
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,480
In this case, it was done in
athletes and non-athletes,

1549
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,380
which is kind of nice.

1550
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,270
This involves taking
athletes and non-athletes

1551
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,050
and exposing them to sauna.

1552
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:47,770
It wasn't particularly hot.

1553
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,940
It was 96 degrees, which isn't cool,

1554
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,990
but it's not really hot.

1555
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:53,900
Nowadays you hear about people
doing very, very hot sauna.

1556
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,530
The humidity of the sauna,
if you want to know,

1557
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,870
is 15 plus or minus 3%.

1558
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:00,640
But basically what they found
was that just one 15 minutes

1559
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,130
sauna session could really increase

1560
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,570
white blood cell profiles and
could adjust cortisol levels

1561
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:08,780
in ways that were beneficial
for combating infection.

1562
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,110
And now there are many
other studies like this.

1563
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,340
Now, this should immediately
make sense based on

1564
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,590
what we said before about fever;

1565
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,810
heating up can actually
help combat infection.

1566
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:18,960
But for those of you that have listened

1567
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,563
to the episodes on temperature,

1568
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,950
what you probably know is
that when you get into a sauna

1569
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,350
or any kind of hot environment,

1570
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,240
your body is also going to be actively

1571
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,210
pushing to cool itself off.

1572
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,750
So, there's probably an increase in heat,

1573
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,010
there is an increase in heating,

1574
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:34,359
but then afterwards
your body will cool off,

1575
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,459
maybe even with a dip below baseline.

1576
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,560
I do want to provide a cautionary note

1577
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,920
that if you are already running a fever,

1578
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,290
getting into a sauna could
take your body temperature

1579
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,770
into dangerously high levels,

1580
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:46,500
dangerously meaning you can kill neurons.

1581
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,990
And once you kill neurons,
they do not come back.

1582
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:50,740
So, please don't kill your neurons.

1583
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,929
I don't recommend getting into a sauna

1584
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,220
if you're already running a fever.

1585
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,899
So this would be something
to do at the initial stage

1586
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:00,379
of an infection or if you're
feeling a little bit off.

1587
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:04,069
So this is kind of a ramping
up or a super protocol

1588
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,389
of the typical advice of take
a hot shower and get into bed.

1589
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,223
That is good advice.

1590
01:09:07,223 --> 01:09:09,920
Now we're talking about a hot sauna,

1591
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,439
probably showering off
and then getting into bed,

1592
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,369
maybe augmenting serotonin.

1593
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,569
I know many people don't
have access to sauna.

1594
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,639
So, in that case, a
very hot bath or shower,

1595
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,140
don't scald yourself, of course,

1596
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,640
but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate

1597
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,229
or right at that edge
of what you can tolerate

1598
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:27,399
would be a good idea.

1599
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:29,299
Some people I've heard are creating saunas

1600
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,359
in their bathrooms by running hot water

1601
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,469
and creating a ton of steam.

1602
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,550
Anything that really heats you up,

1603
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,899
but not to dangerously high levels

1604
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:38,199
is going to be beneficial.

1605
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:41,283
If you have access to a sauna, terrific.

1606
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,873
This again was only 15 minutes.

1607
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:47,829
They'd had a cool off session.

1608
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,210
Would you get more of an increase?

1609
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,620
People always want to know
if you did it twice as much,

1610
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,420
would you get twice an increase?

1611
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,810
Those data don't really exist yet.

1612
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:57,130
However, if you are
interested in maximizing

1613
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,640
the effects of sauna,

1614
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,580
it is clear that a cool
off period is important.

1615
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,350
So it's not that a 15
minute sauna is good,

1616
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,910
and a 30 minute sauna is better.

1617
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:09,120
If you are going to take
that route of exploring more,

1618
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,420
it does seem that doing a
15 minute heating period

1619
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,650
followed by a five to 10
minute cooling period,

1620
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:18,500
and then getting back into
the heat can be beneficial.

1621
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,620
And this is interesting.

1622
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:24,620
It gets to the mechanisms by
which the hypothalamus areas,

1623
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:26,020
the areas of the hypothalamus, that is,

1624
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,250
that generate increases in body heat,

1625
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,600
the activation of those
neurons occurs as you heat up

1626
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,550
and then were you to just stay
in that heated environment,

1627
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:37,620
they would actually shut
off and some other neurons

1628
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,680
would be handling the job so to speak.

1629
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,230
But by getting in and out
of the heated environment,

1630
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,460
you actually force that
system to send repeated pulses

1631
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,890
of these cortisol lowering
and white cell stimulating

1632
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:51,360
signals to the body.

1633
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,977
Some of you have probably
heard the phrase,

1634
01:10:52,977 --> 01:10:55,327
"feed a fever, starve a cold."

1635
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,960
I don't know who first said that.

1636
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,410
I couldn't find the
citation, but we hear this.

1637
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:05,397
And we can speculate that
the reason that phrase,

1638
01:11:05,397 --> 01:11:08,170
"feed a fever, starve a cold" came to be

1639
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,800
is because of the adaptive
function of fever,

1640
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,360
that increases in body
temperature make it challenging

1641
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:19,160
for intruding viruses
and bacteria to survive.

1642
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,100
Even though, of course, highly
elevated body temperatures

1643
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,633
pose a danger to the
host organism, to you.

1644
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,030
Feeding, eating does cause an
increase in body temperature

1645
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:33,480
through the so-called
thermogenic effect of food.

1646
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,720
So I can understand the
logic of feed a fever.

1647
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,700
It would mean that when you have a fever,

1648
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,300
it's your body's natural
attempt to heat up

1649
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,150
and kill some invading thing.

1650
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:46,180
And by eating, you would further increase

1651
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,930
your body temperature.

1652
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:51,223
Why you would want to starve
a cold, I don't know, however.

1653
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:55,290
Maybe it's because when your
nasal passages are congested,

1654
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:58,070
it's uncomfortable to eat
or something of that sort.

1655
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:00,220
So the feet of fever
part makes sense to me,

1656
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,900
the starve a cold part is
still mysterious to me.

1657
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:06,870
I couldn't find any logical
reason why that would be good.

1658
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:09,830
There are communities out
there that believe that fasting

1659
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:14,763
is a viable way to combat
certain types of infection.

1660
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,380
Fasting, in particular, prolonged fasts,

1661
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,540
do increase the amount of adrenaline,

1662
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,310
also called epinephrin,
in the brain and body.

1663
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:27,930
And as we'll next explain, epinephrin,

1664
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:31,500
adrenaline does have a powerful effect on

1665
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,250
the various inflammatory cytokines

1666
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,370
and on the immune system in general.

1667
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:38,190
So, let's talk about a behavioral protocol

1668
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,700
that anyone can use; it
doesn't involve any equipment,

1669
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,700
you don't need a sauna, you
don't need anything at all,

1670
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,900
that has been demonstrated
in excellent peer reviewed

1671
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,970
research to enhance the
function of the immune system

1672
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,920
and actually allow people
to combat infection

1673
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,780
in very dramatic ways.

1674
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:58,900
Next, I'd like to do an
in-depth analysis of a study

1675
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,760
that has achieved some
prominence out there,

1676
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,100
not just in the scientific
literature, but on the internet,

1677
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,510
because it relates to how
particular types of breathing

1678
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,630
can impact the immune system

1679
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:14,650
and the ability to combat infection.

1680
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:16,277
The title of this paper is

1681
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:19,620
"Voluntary activation of the
sympathetic nervous system

1682
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:24,020
and attenuation of the innate
immune response in humans."

1683
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,170
This is a paper that
was published in PNAS,

1684
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,010
which is the Proceedings
of the National Academy

1685
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,130
of Sciences, USA.

1686
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:32,223
It's a very prestigious journal.

1687
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,780
For those of you that know PNAS,

1688
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,610
you know that there are certain
papers published in PNAS,

1689
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,410
or there used to be that
were not peer reviewed.

1690
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,340
In recent years, I think
all of them have moved

1691
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,320
to peer reviewed papers.

1692
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,360
So this is a peer reviewed,
very high quality study.

1693
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,170
And I just want to describe
the basic contour of the study.

1694
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,690
I'll explain the findings,
and then I want to go in-depth

1695
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:55,810
and explain the mechanistic
basis for these findings

1696
01:13:55,810 --> 01:14:00,090
and the protocol that we can
all export from these findings.

1697
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,853
So, here we go.

1698
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,170
First of all, a couple of
terms so that everybody

1699
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,373
is on the same page.

1700
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:10,580
The sympathetic nervous
system is one division

1701
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,500
of our nervous system.

1702
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,720
It's a set of neurons down
the middle of our spinal cord

1703
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:19,530
and in our brain that generally
lead to a heightened state

1704
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,030
of arousal and alertness.

1705
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:23,550
It's associated with
epinephrin release in the brain

1706
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,680
and adrenaline release in the body.

1707
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,860
It's the so-called fight or flight system

1708
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,440
when it's really active,

1709
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,273
but it's the system that's
active when we are wide awake.

1710
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,850
And we already talked about
the innate immune system.

1711
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,950
That's that first line of
defense after the skin barrier,

1712
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:44,670
of course, whereby some
infection comes into the body

1713
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:48,690
and there's this rapid response
of increasing inflammation.

1714
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:52,070
And that's also about the time
that you first feel lousy.

1715
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,903
So when you start to feel like,

1716
01:14:52,903 --> 01:14:54,170
"ugh, I think I've got something.

1717
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,670
I don't feel right, a headache.

1718
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:57,010
I feel nauseous.

1719
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:57,870
I'm heating up.

1720
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:58,710
I don't feel good."

1721
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:02,083
That's the innate immune
system kicking in.

1722
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,270
So what they did in this study,

1723
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,740
and by the way, I should say they,

1724
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:10,880
this first author is Kox, K-O-X,

1725
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,570
last author, last name
Pickkers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S.

1726
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:20,200
What they did was they
exposed human subjects

1727
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,553
to an endotoxin.

1728
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:25,790
In other words, they
injected people with E. coli,

1729
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:29,430
which is a bacteria which makes people,

1730
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,950
all people feel terrible.

1731
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:34,700
Makes you nauseous,
fever, vomiting, diarrhea,

1732
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,610
it's very unpleasant, okay?

1733
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:39,110
These people voluntarily
signed up for this study.

1734
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,680
However, some of the
subjects in this study

1735
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:48,630
performed a behavioral protocol
that can best be described

1736
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,730
as cyclic hyperventilation.

1737
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:53,210
My lab works on these types
of breathing protocols.

1738
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,670
This is not work that my lab did,

1739
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:57,840
but basically subjects hyperventilate,

1740
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,140
followed by breath
retention, by breath holds,

1741
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,220
and I'll explain exactly what they did.

1742
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,610
They also looked at other
forms of behavioral protocols,

1743
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,010
but let's focus on that one.

1744
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:10,820
So, they're comparing
controls that do just sort

1745
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,060
of a basic meditation
versus people that do

1746
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,833
this intense breathing
followed by some breath holds.

1747
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,447
I'm just paraphrasing here,
in the intervention group,

1748
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:20,510
the breathing group,

1749
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:24,580
plasma levels of
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,

1750
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,750
so this is a cytokine that
is lowers inflammation,

1751
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,143
increased after endotoxin administration.

1752
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,840
And that was triggered by an increase

1753
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,090
in epinephrin and adrenaline.

1754
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:37,950
So, in other words,

1755
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,900
doing a particular pattern
of breathing allowed

1756
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,370
an anti-inflammatory
cytokine to be turned on,

1757
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:45,440
whereas that was not
the case in the subjects

1758
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,890
that did not do this
particular breathing protocol.

1759
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,420
And they discovered that levels

1760
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:56,420
of proinflammatory TNF-alpha,
tumor necrosis factor alpha,

1761
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,470
IL-6, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8,

1762
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,290
which you should all be familiar with now,

1763
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:04,340
as proinflammatory cytokines were lower

1764
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,640
in the intervention group.

1765
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,800
Whereas these IL-10 levels

1766
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,550
that are anti-inflammatory went up.

1767
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,200
Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower

1768
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,530
in the intervention group.

1769
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,770
So this is an amazing finding, right?

1770
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,033
These are human subjects.

1771
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,330
One group of subjects is
doing this breathing protocol.

1772
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:24,420
The other group of subjects
is just meditating.

1773
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:28,560
Both sets of subjects have
been injected with E. coli.

1774
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,550
So, you know everyone's
getting the same amount

1775
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,510
placed into their system.

1776
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,760
This is very, very interesting.

1777
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,990
And it leads to the question
that every good scientist,

1778
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,310
two year old or health
information seeker asks,

1779
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,990
which is why?

1780
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:43,823
How?

1781
01:17:43,823 --> 01:17:44,810
How in the world does this work?

1782
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,970
Why does this work?

1783
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:49,760
Well to make a long story shortish,

1784
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,030
because I am going to go into depth here,

1785
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,860
the reason it works is
because the sympathetic

1786
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:59,380
nervous system, the so-called stress part

1787
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,517
of our nervous system, it's
not really called that,

1788
01:18:01,517 --> 01:18:04,170
but the part of our nervous
system that triggers stress

1789
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:07,473
from mild stress, to severe
stress, even to panic,

1790
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,370
causes the release of
adrenaline and epinephrin

1791
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:13,060
in the brain and body.

1792
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,300
And under normal circumstances,

1793
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,530
when we have some sort
of invading infection,

1794
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,980
our body is able to push back on that,

1795
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,950
to resist it by engaging
the stress response.

1796
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:27,980
So what's happening here is
there's a behavioral protocol

1797
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,180
involving the nervous
system, 'cause all behaviors

1798
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,420
are generated from the
nervous system of course.

1799
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,220
A behavioral protocol that
people are deliberately employing

1800
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:39,830
that allows them to activate
the sympathetic nervous system,

1801
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:43,610
which in turn allows them to
activate the normal pathways

1802
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:47,510
by which immune system
function is enhanced.

1803
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,370
Okay?

1804
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,300
Now, the reason I'm
underscoring this is that

1805
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,570
the common interpretation of
this study is that somehow

1806
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:57,900
it blocks the normal immune response,

1807
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,780
but that's not really
what's happening here.

1808
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:03,540
Yes, there's a reduction
in inflammatory cytokines

1809
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:06,410
and there's an increase in
anti-inflammatory cytokines,

1810
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,340
but that's not really the same thing

1811
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,600
as blocking the immune response.

1812
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,330
This could just as easily
be viewed as enhancing

1813
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:16,290
the immune response and
combating the intruder,

1814
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,120
in this case, E. coli.

1815
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,960
So, let's parse this study
a little bit more closely.

1816
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,910
First of all, what is this
magical pattern of breathing?

1817
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:26,340
Some of you may recognize this

1818
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,200
as so-called Wim Hof breathing.

1819
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,830
Wim, of course the Dutchman.

1820
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,470
I think his occupation online used to be

1821
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,090
listed as daredevil, believe
it or not, on Wikipedia.

1822
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,743
That's a pretty cool occupation.

1823
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:42,590
Wim is best known for his
activities with cold exposure,

1824
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,000
he holds multiple world records for that,

1825
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,510
swimming under icebergs
and other incredible feats,

1826
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:51,070
that you definitely
don't want to try unless

1827
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,760
you're extremely skilled and really know

1828
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,750
what you're doing, as he does,

1829
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,977
but also for the use of breath work.

1830
01:19:56,977 --> 01:20:00,430
The breathing that is
so-called Wim Hof breathing

1831
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,370
is very similar, not exactly the same,

1832
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:05,410
but very similar to Tummo breathing,

1833
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:07,420
as it's been described historically.

1834
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,740
In the science and physiology community

1835
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,550
and in my laboratory, 'cause
I run a university laboratory,

1836
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,670
we refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation,

1837
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:17,950
which just means repeated
deep breaths in and out.

1838
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:19,350
And then there are these retentions.

1839
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:23,130
So, because I'm here
in the hot seat anyway,

1840
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,910
I might as well demonstrate it for you

1841
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,160
so you know what this looks like.

1842
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,360
There are variations on
this, so with respect to Wim,

1843
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,120
with respect to Tummo practitioners,

1844
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:34,150
with respect to the cyclic
hyperventilators everywhere,

1845
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:36,020
this is one general theme of it.

1846
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:40,420
It involves 20 to 30 deep inhales

1847
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,860
and then exhales through the mouth,

1848
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:46,570
followed by a exhale of all one's air

1849
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:49,820
and a breath hold, that's the retention.

1850
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:53,330
And then at some point,
15 to 60 seconds later,

1851
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:55,490
repeating the 25 or 30 breaths.

1852
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:59,050
And then again, a breath
hold with lungs empty.

1853
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,490
There are variations on this,

1854
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:04,490
but in our laboratory and
in this particular study,

1855
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:05,760
it looks something like this.

1856
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,420
Okay, I'm not going to do
the whole thing right now,

1857
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,156
but it goes something like this.

1858
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:12,656
[Andrew deeply breathing]

1859
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:20,970
Okay, so let's assume I
did that for 30 breaths.

1860
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:23,850
I can already feel myself
perspiring a little bit.

1861
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:26,270
You're heating up, that's
the release of adrenaline.

1862
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,590
It's caused by that breathing pattern,

1863
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,010
and then exhaling all of one's air,

1864
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,945
no speaking in between like I'm doing.

1865
01:21:30,945 --> 01:21:34,362
[Andrew deeply exhaling]

1866
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:39,420
And then sitting lungs empty
until one feels the impulse

1867
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,150
to breathe and then
repeating for several rounds,

1868
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,770
two or three or even four rounds.

1869
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,790
Now some people will also
introduce a big inhale

1870
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:48,490
and breath hold at the end

1871
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:51,280
and find that indeed they can
hold their breath much longer

1872
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,030
than they normally would be able to.

1873
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:56,630
Because the trigger to
breathe is normally activated

1874
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:59,700
by increases in carbon
dioxide in our blood.

1875
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,580
We have neurons in our brain stem

1876
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:04,270
and in our various regions
of our brain, actually,

1877
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:07,230
that respond to when
carbon dioxide is too high

1878
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,740
and trigger the reflex to breathe.

1879
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,980
But when we exhale deeply,

1880
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,860
we blow off a lot of carbon dioxide

1881
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,860
so we don't feel that impulse
to breathe come quite as soon.

1882
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,060
Basically this study
looked at people doing

1883
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:24,440
these cyclic hyperventilation
with retention,

1884
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,740
25 or 30 breaths, then the retention,

1885
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,390
25 or 30 breaths, then retention,

1886
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,210
25 or 30 breaths, then the retention.

1887
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:33,480
So, three rounds of 25 to 30
breaths followed by exhale,

1888
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,210
hold in between of various duration.

1889
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:40,960
But in general, 15 to
60 seconds is typical.

1890
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,440
What happened physiologically?

1891
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,300
This is one of the
reasons I like this study.

1892
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,810
What happened physiologically?

1893
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,520
Well, a couple of things.

1894
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,770
Of course, blood oxygenation drops.

1895
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:55,410
You would expect that
based on hyperventilation

1896
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,870
and especially based on the exhale

1897
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,140
of so much carbon dioxide.

1898
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,240
We could explain why that is,

1899
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,570
but blood levels of oxygen drop.

1900
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:08,570
The pH, the alkalinity
of the body goes way up.

1901
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,120
This is very interesting.

1902
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,430
If you look up this paper,

1903
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:14,730
you can look at Figure One,
Panel C, the pH goes way up.

1904
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:15,840
People become alkaline.

1905
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,270
You've heard before of alkaline water.

1906
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:19,103
I hate to say this,

1907
01:23:19,103 --> 01:23:20,610
I'll probably lose some friends for this,

1908
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:24,140
but yeah, don't waste your money
on drinking alkaline water.

1909
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,430
You can't really shift the
alkalinity of your body.

1910
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:30,340
There are cases where some
compartment in your body

1911
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,950
needs to be more alkaline than the rest.

1912
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:34,530
Your gut is a different
alkalinity than other areas

1913
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:38,310
of your body, et cetera, but
ingesting high alkaline water

1914
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:40,410
isn't going to shift
your overall alkalinity.

1915
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,150
If someone can send me a quality reference

1916
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,400
that shows different than I'm happy

1917
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,450
to revise that statement.

1918
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,760
But in any case, doing
that pattern of breathing

1919
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,540
that I just described
greatly increases the pH.

1920
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,490
Greatly, I should say,
it doesn't send it off

1921
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:55,360
into dangerous levels.

1922
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,440
It takes it from 7.4 to 7.6,

1923
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:01,260
which is a significant
increase in alkalinity.

1924
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,630
So, as pH levels, for those
you remember high school

1925
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:08,750
or college chemistry, as the
numbers on the pH go down,

1926
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,180
you're becoming more acidic,

1927
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,680
as they go up, you're
becoming more alkaline,

1928
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,110
okay or more basic.

1929
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:17,870
So, these subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6

1930
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:18,920
during the breathing,

1931
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,700
and then afterwards it returned to normal.

1932
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,260
But that shift in alkalinity is thought

1933
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:24,950
to be important here.

1934
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:25,900
So, what's going on here?

1935
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:30,900
How is the breathing
leading to the shifts in...

1936
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:35,070
Or I should say reduction
in inflammatory cytokines

1937
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:38,760
and an increase in the liberation

1938
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,240
of these anti-inflammatory cytokines.

1939
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,450
Well, the authors make some good arguments

1940
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:47,780
as to why it's not the shift in pH per se,

1941
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:52,030
or the shift in carbon
dioxide levels in the blood,

1942
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:54,750
but rather it's the release of epinephrin.

1943
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:57,740
And there's some good reason
to believe why that's the case.

1944
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,180
It's beyond the scope of this discussion,

1945
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:02,290
but that it's actually
the release of epinephrin,

1946
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:05,930
AKA adrenaline, that's
causing this reduction

1947
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,170
in inflammation.

1948
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:11,660
And that's actually supported by something

1949
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,390
that you've probably experienced before,

1950
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:15,190
which is if you've ever
worked, worked, worked, worked,

1951
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,490
worked really hard, or
you've been a caretaker

1952
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:20,120
for somebody else or studying for exams,

1953
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,560
and people around you are getting sick

1954
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,690
and you're just powering through it

1955
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:24,670
and you're not getting sick,

1956
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:27,320
but then you stop, you
turn in your final exam,

1957
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,910
you stopped taking care of somebody else,

1958
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,350
or you finally stop and
rest or you go on vacation,

1959
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:34,070
and then you get sick.

1960
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:38,870
Well, you've just experienced
the effect that adrenaline,

1961
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:42,040
epinephrin can have in
activating your immune system

1962
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,040
by way of the nervous system,

1963
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,710
in order to keep fighting
and combating infection.

1964
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,470
And that brings us to a larger theme,

1965
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:52,980
which is that stress and
combating infection or a wound

1966
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,490
is not one unique system.

1967
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,210
It's the same stress system that you use

1968
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:00,110
to combat psychological stress.

1969
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:01,830
So when you're very, very stressed,

1970
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,670
at least in the short term,

1971
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:06,670
because you release so much
adrenaline and epinephrin,

1972
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:09,340
you're actually better
able to combat infections

1973
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,517
and you reduce inflammation

1974
01:26:10,517 --> 01:26:12,620
and the whole feeling
lousy response, right?

1975
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,810
Remember reduced flu-like symptoms here.

1976
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:18,110
So this pattern of breathing
is actually a very useful tool.

1977
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:20,970
And I confess, I use this
pattern of breathing anytime

1978
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:23,790
I am at the initial stages
of getting some sort of bug.

1979
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:26,440
If I feel like I've been
running myself ragged,

1980
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,470
or if I somehow, for whatever reason,

1981
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:29,750
have a tickle in my throat,

1982
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,930
or I have that kind of
sensation in my nose,

1983
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:35,330
like I might've caught a bug of some sort,

1984
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:37,780
I will do this pattern of breathing.

1985
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,330
I've been doing it consistently,

1986
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,713
gosh, for the last four years or more.

1987
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:45,190
Now this is just anecdotal reports,

1988
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:49,240
but I find that it allows
me indeed to either

1989
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,750
have those early symptoms disappear,

1990
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:54,560
or it allows me to just
kind of push through

1991
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,800
and harder, longer.

1992
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,310
I don't suggest people
continue to push through

1993
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:00,610
exposure to infections.

1994
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:03,120
Obviously you don't want
to infect other people,

1995
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,700
nor do you want to crash and
suddenly get a massive illness

1996
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,130
of some sort because you
stopped doing this breathing.

1997
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,850
But I do think it's a useful tool.

1998
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,730
It's a purely behavioral
intervention that has been shown

1999
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,830
here and now there are
additional studies on the way,

2000
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:21,310
to enhance the function
of your immune system

2001
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:22,740
and to reduce inflammation.

2002
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:26,100
And this is to me, one of
the most concrete examples

2003
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:31,100
of a zero cost tool that
bridges the activation

2004
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,880
of the nervous system through breathing

2005
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:38,200
with the immune system by
way of releasing adrenaline

2006
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:41,710
and thereby reducing the terrible effects

2007
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:46,090
or feelings of lousiness
from, in this case,

2008
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:48,050
an E. coli infection.

2009
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:52,270
Now, I'd like to focus on a
couple of important points

2010
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:55,820
that I haven't heard
discussed broadly elsewhere,

2011
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,670
which is that the hyperventilation

2012
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:01,680
and the breath retention
are both important.

2013
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:06,680
So you can't simply
hyperventilate to get this effect

2014
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,230
at the level of epinephrin release

2015
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:11,880
and reduction in inflammatory cytokines.

2016
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,260
It's been shown before that
the hyperventilation phase

2017
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:19,940
and the hypoxia, which is
a low oxygen saturation

2018
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:22,030
due to the breath retention,

2019
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:26,120
they both combine to increase
epinephrin adrenaline levels.

2020
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,040
So, you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths,

2021
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,210
and then the retention.

2022
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:33,080
25 or 30 breaths then the retention,

2023
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,790
meaning that the exhale
with the breath hold,

2024
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:36,750
in order to get the full effect.

2025
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,820
I'd also want to provide a
critical cautionary note.

2026
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:43,730
Don't do this anywhere near
water or while driving a car.

2027
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,610
These things might seem kind of obvious,

2028
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:49,730
but obviously in the off
chance that you black out

2029
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,300
or something like that,
it could be disastrous.

2030
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,980
So, please be careful.

2031
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:56,600
And again, don't try and
push the breath hold.

2032
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,960
The moment you feel the impulse
to breathe, just breathe.

2033
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,420
And it did seem that the three
rounds of 25 to 30 breaths

2034
01:29:04,592 --> 01:29:06,630
with breath hold retentions in between

2035
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,550
was the ideal protocol.

2036
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:11,630
There's one last very
interesting feature of this study

2037
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,970
that I want to emphasize.

2038
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:16,010
And that was that they
actually measured the so-called

2039
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:18,040
catecholamine concentrations.

2040
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,720
Catecholamines are things like dopamine,

2041
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,000
epinephrin, norepinephrine.

2042
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,830
These are chemicals in your
nervous system and body

2043
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:29,380
that promote states of
alertness, dopamine, of course,

2044
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:32,760
part of the reward and
motivation pathways.

2045
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,150
They explored the levels of
these molecules in blood,

2046
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:41,150
in plasma during and after
this breathing protocol.

2047
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,220
And it was interesting,
as I mentioned before,

2048
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,540
epinephrin showed robust
increases compared

2049
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,550
to the control group,

2050
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:49,642
norepinephrine, significant
increases occurred

2051
01:29:49,642 --> 01:29:51,103
in the breathing group,

2052
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:55,180
in the cyclic hyperventilation
retention breathing group,

2053
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,930
of course, but less so.

2054
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:01,630
And dopamine levels
actually dropped somewhat.

2055
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,910
But this is very interesting
because there's a new

2056
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:09,480
and emerging literature largely from Asya,

2057
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,430
A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab in Israel.

2058
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:18,430
What her laboratory has shown
is that motivational state

2059
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:23,710
and mindset has a powerful
impact on various aspects

2060
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:26,010
of the immune system
that were thought to be

2061
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:29,430
independent of the brain
and mind and thinking.

2062
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:32,890
So this brings us back to
something that we discussed

2063
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:34,270
at the very beginning of this episode,

2064
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:37,190
which is that 20, 30 years ago,

2065
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,460
the idea that you could
heal the body with the mind

2066
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,820
was considered kind of quackery.

2067
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:45,350
I think that there was an
intervening period up until now

2068
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:48,120
where people might've said,
"sure, if you're stressed out,

2069
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,220
it's going to make things worse."

2070
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,950
I mean, I think everyone
agrees that stress

2071
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:54,300
makes every thing worse at some level,

2072
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,640
outcomes to neurodegeneration,

2073
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,530
performance in a physical
endeavors and mental endeavors.

2074
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:04,380
If stress is too high for too long

2075
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:07,480
people experience different challenges

2076
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,930
and essentially every
major psychiatric disorder,

2077
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:11,870
everything suffers, but in the short term,

2078
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:14,290
stress can actually be
beneficial in the ways

2079
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:15,220
that we just described.

2080
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:18,260
And stress, if we break it down

2081
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,900
is really a neurochemical state, right?

2082
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,310
It's the release of these catacholamines.

2083
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:26,760
And what Asya Rolls' laboratory has shown

2084
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,920
is that when the so-called dopamine system

2085
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,870
and at several episodes,

2086
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,760
I described there are
multiple dopamine systems,

2087
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,280
but the so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway

2088
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,830
involving areas like the
nucleus accumbens, et cetera.

2089
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:43,630
When the reward system that's
associated with dopamine

2090
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:46,033
and norepinephrine is activated,

2091
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:50,923
you see incredible effects,
including for instance,

2092
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:55,970
highly significant reduction
in tumor size in cancers.

2093
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,570
Now, why would that be?

2094
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:01,850
How is it that mindset,
dopamine and tumors,

2095
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,650
and tumor growth are somehow linked?

2096
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,890
We now know how this
occurs largely through

2097
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:09,230
the incredible work of
Asya Rolls and others.

2098
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:13,170
So, now I'd like to turn our
focus to how it is specifically

2099
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:17,310
that certain mindsets
impact the immune system

2100
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:19,000
in ways that we can
actually point to specific

2101
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,280
biological pathways and
also specific protocols

2102
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,760
related to mindset.

2103
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,660
I guess a simple way to frame
all this would be to say

2104
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,180
that most of us are
aware that yes, indeed,

2105
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:32,380
you can worry yourself sick.

2106
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,170
We've been told that, you're
going to worry yourself sick.

2107
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:37,870
And actually there was a
paper published in "Science,"

2108
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:39,950
again, one of the top
three journals out there,

2109
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:43,150
the top three really being
"Nature," "Science," and "Cell."

2110
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:45,570
And then other of course,
excellent journals exist,

2111
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:49,480
but this was a paper that came
out in "Science" last year.

2112
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:53,740
First author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A,

2113
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:58,530
describing psychogenic stress and fever.

2114
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,400
So this was looking or
asking the question,

2115
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:05,110
are there areas of the
brain that actually underlie

2116
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:08,050
this notion that we can
worry ourselves sick?

2117
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:10,780
And they discovered a new
pathway and they were able to

2118
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:14,500
both activate this pathway
independent of worry and stress

2119
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,280
and see illness occur,

2120
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,210
and they were able to
inhibit this pathway,

2121
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:20,270
block activity in this neural pathway

2122
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:24,930
and prevent psychogenic
fever and the worrying

2123
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,160
of oneself sick.

2124
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:29,800
So, they were able to do this
in a very controlled way.

2125
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,920
I'll just mention the pathway in case

2126
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,313
you want to look it up in more detail.

2127
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,560
This is a corticolimbic pathway.

2128
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,310
So, just to orient us,
the cortex is more or less

2129
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:42,760
the outer shell of the brain.

2130
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,390
It's involved in thinking
and sensation and perceptions

2131
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:48,530
and learning and maintenance
of a lot of memories

2132
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:49,363
are stored there.

2133
01:33:49,363 --> 01:33:52,790
We all hear that you learn and
remember in the hippocampus,

2134
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:55,090
that's the initial site
of learning and memory,

2135
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:56,660
but then that information,
believe it or not,

2136
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,500
is passed off to the
cortex where it's stored

2137
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,890
in kind of a long-term
hard drive type storage.

2138
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:05,600
So the corticolimbic
pathway is one in which

2139
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,240
your thoughts, your prior
experiences can literally

2140
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:13,760
in a structure way, feed down
onto the areas of the brain

2141
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,820
that control very basal processes,

2142
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:17,120
including temperature regulation.

2143
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,340
So this is a corticolimbic
hypothalamic pathway.

2144
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,720
We talked earlier about the hypothalamus

2145
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,560
as controlling temperature
and a lot of sickness

2146
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,190
related behavior, right?

2147
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:26,860
Remember vagus up to the hypothalamus

2148
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:29,770
and all the sleep more,
less appetite, fever.

2149
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,450
Okay, that's all in the hypothalamus.

2150
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:36,450
This is a top-down corticolimbic
hypothalamic pathway,

2151
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:38,080
and it has a fancy name.

2152
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,900
It's the dorsal peduncular
cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.

2153
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,980
The short of that is the DP/DTT.

2154
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,960
Let's just call it the DP/DTT,

2155
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,180
to the dorsomedial hypothalamus.

2156
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,200
A lot of D's.

2157
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,550
It shouldn't mean anything.

2158
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:55,200
It doesn't really matter what we call it.

2159
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:00,200
But what's important is
conceptually it's a pathway

2160
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:02,440
that originates insights to the brain

2161
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,830
that are associated with thinking,

2162
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:07,470
with emotion and with prior history,

2163
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:09,420
and feeds directly into
an area of the brain

2164
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,500
that's involved in basic physiological

2165
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,660
subconsciously controlled processes.

2166
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,340
So, that's incredible, right?

2167
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:19,040
And it points to a physical
pathway by which the way

2168
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,940
we think about something
changes something core

2169
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:23,770
about our physiology.

2170
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:25,710
Now, in some ways that
shouldn't be surprising, right?

2171
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:27,390
If you think about
something that excites you,

2172
01:35:27,390 --> 01:35:28,850
your heart rate can increase.

2173
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:30,120
You think about something
that terrifies you,

2174
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,100
your heart rate can increase.

2175
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,610
So the idea that thinking
controls our physiology

2176
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:38,460
is not a new concept at all,
but somehow human beings,

2177
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:43,010
we have been challenged with
the idea that we could actually

2178
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:44,680
think ourselves into being sick.

2179
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:49,680
But this paper from Kataoka
shows that if you expose

2180
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:52,323
somebody to a psychological stress,

2181
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,470
you can actually activate this
pathway and create a fever.

2182
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:57,303
And how do they do that?

2183
01:35:57,303 --> 01:35:59,770
Well, you can do this by exposing subjects

2184
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:02,960
to a very stressful real event,

2185
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,080
and you cue it through
our associative learning.

2186
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,970
So, maybe, like my PILOT
V5s, which I love so much,

2187
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:10,300
we could traumatize me to the PILOT V5

2188
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,930
if I had some horrible
experience happen to me

2189
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:14,510
while I'm looking at and
concentrating on the PILOT V5.

2190
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,030
Then you take away the
horrible experience,

2191
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:17,007
you give me the PILOT V5,

2192
01:36:17,007 --> 01:36:19,910
and I start to experience
a lot of the symptoms

2193
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:22,400
associated with that terrible event.

2194
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,920
They were able to do this
using sickness inducing stimuli

2195
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,753
and so forth.

2196
01:36:26,753 --> 01:36:29,320
They did all the various derivations

2197
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,130
and identified this pathway
that when activated,

2198
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:35,210
even in the absence of
some horrible event,

2199
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:39,830
could create fever and
illness-like behavior and so forth.

2200
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:42,580
And if they blocked certain stations

2201
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,590
along this neural pathway,
they could block that effect.

2202
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:48,360
So this is really concrete
evidence, proof, if you will,

2203
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,320
that there are dedicated
pathways in the mammalian brain,

2204
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,800
your brain and mine,

2205
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,653
that allow us to turn
thoughts into illness.

2206
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,280
That's kind of a depressing idea.

2207
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,550
What about the inverse?

2208
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:02,290
What about turning thoughts into health?

2209
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:04,593
Well, that's the work of Asya Rolls.

2210
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,660
They explored the well-established
psychological phenomenon

2211
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:15,640
that when cancer patients
or very ill people

2212
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,735
or people who are suffering
from very debilitating injuries,

2213
01:37:18,735 --> 01:37:23,735
when people had a
reported a sense of hope,

2214
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:26,680
their rates of recovery
were much higher, right?

2215
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,690
Sounds very subjective.

2216
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:32,090
But what is a sense of hope?

2217
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:34,890
A sense of hope is a sense of the future.

2218
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:37,010
A sense of the future
is tightly associated

2219
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:38,670
with the dopamine system.

2220
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:40,970
Dopamine, again, being
this molecule of reward

2221
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:42,930
and motivation and movement,

2222
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:47,930
but movement and motivation are
about things that are beyond

2223
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:51,440
the confines of our skin
and are about the future.

2224
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,160
And so what they've discovered
and through other studies

2225
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,400
from other groups have
discovered is that stimulation

2226
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,610
of the dopamine pathway,

2227
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:02,133
either simply by thinking about a future,

2228
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:04,430
ideally a positive future,

2229
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:07,110
but thinking about a positive
future leads to activation

2230
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:09,600
of the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway

2231
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,740
and could reduce the size of tumors,

2232
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,590
could accelerate wound healing,

2233
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:18,380
could greatly accelerate the
passage from a state of illness

2234
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:21,240
to a state of health and wellbeing.

2235
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,060
So there are many, many
studies now starting

2236
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:27,280
to wick out related to this.

2237
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,730
There's also the idea that
augmenting the dopamine system

2238
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:33,240
can increase the rate of healing.

2239
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,740
And so, there are individuals
out there who opt,

2240
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:38,860
for instance, to take things
that increase dopamine.

2241
01:38:38,860 --> 01:38:42,260
Now, obviously drugs of abuse
would not be a good idea

2242
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,280
in this context, even though
they increase dopamine,

2243
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,330
they lead to big crashes,

2244
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:48,030
they have addictive properties, et cetera.

2245
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:50,050
I've talked before on
this podcast about things

2246
01:38:50,050 --> 01:38:55,050
like L-tyrosine, taking anywhere
from 500 to 750 milligrams

2247
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:58,290
can increase dopamine because tyrosine

2248
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:00,140
is a dopamine precursor, of course.

2249
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,100
Things like Mucuna
pruriens, which are L-dopa,

2250
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,230
the immediate precursor to dopamine.

2251
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:06,530
Some of these will lead
to somewhat of a crash

2252
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:08,460
in certain individuals.

2253
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:10,610
Other people tolerate
them a little bit better.

2254
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,860
Again, you have to talk to your doctor,

2255
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,160
you have to figure out
what's right for you.

2256
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,250
If you have bipolar or
mania or schizophrenia,

2257
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,300
these things, I would not
recommend them at all.

2258
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,390
I'm not recommending them at all,

2259
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,640
I'm just mentioning them
for potential exploration

2260
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,230
if it's safe and right for you.

2261
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:26,200
But the point is this:

2262
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:30,170
the dopamine system, when
activated can accelerate healing,

2263
01:39:30,170 --> 01:39:34,180
it can accelerate the recovery
from injury of all kinds.

2264
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:37,470
And that shouldn't come as a mystery

2265
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:39,490
or surprise result to us.

2266
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:42,760
It's because this reward
pathway and the fact

2267
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:45,220
that it's related to a sense of the future

2268
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:48,430
seems to liberate entire
systems within the body

2269
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:52,780
that make inflammatory cytokines go down,

2270
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:55,610
and anti-inflammatory cytokines go up.

2271
01:39:55,610 --> 01:40:00,330
Exactly as was demonstrated
in the beautiful PNAS study

2272
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:04,030
where breathing, cyclic hyperventilation,

2273
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:07,630
was used to increase epinephrin,
increase norepinephrine,

2274
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:10,800
and to augment the catecholamine system.

2275
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,610
So, I think that the bridges
between these studies

2276
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,443
are really relevant.

2277
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:17,180
In one case, I'm talking about potentially

2278
01:40:17,180 --> 01:40:20,360
taking an over-the-counter
compound to increase dopamine

2279
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,290
to accelerate healing.

2280
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:24,380
In another case, we're
talking about using breathing.

2281
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:27,660
There's also the use
of cold water exposure

2282
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:28,570
to increase dopamine.

2283
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:30,300
I talked about this several episodes ago,

2284
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,640
but it's been shown that
immersing oneself in cold water

2285
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,010
up to the neck or so.

2286
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:35,843
How cold?

2287
01:40:35,843 --> 01:40:37,030
Well, it depends on what you can tolerate,

2288
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:38,310
but uncomfortably cold,

2289
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:40,210
but not so cold that
you become hypothermic,

2290
01:40:40,210 --> 01:40:42,870
but where it's challenging to get in,

2291
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:46,280
but you can stay there for
three to 10 minutes or so,

2292
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:50,120
has been shown to lead
to very significant,

2293
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:53,820
up to doubling or more of
baseline dopamine levels

2294
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:56,890
and epinephrin levels that
go on for several hours.

2295
01:40:56,890 --> 01:41:01,230
This may be the basis for why
people will do cold showers

2296
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:03,110
or ice baths and then get into a sauna.

2297
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:06,890
So, what's called
cold-heat contrast therapy,

2298
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:09,330
as a way to augment
these neurotransmitters.

2299
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:11,210
Today, we've been talking about
how these neurotransmitters

2300
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:14,950
can be used to enhance the
function of the immune system.

2301
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:17,870
And so just keep in mind that
anytime you're talking about

2302
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:19,330
increasing neurotransmitter levels,

2303
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:22,190
that can be done pharmacologically
through supplementation,

2304
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:24,560
or the can be done
behaviorally through exposure

2305
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,350
to cold water, for instance,

2306
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:29,210
or it can be done even
just simply by breathing

2307
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:30,100
in a particular way,

2308
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:32,893
cyclic hyperventilation
followed by retention.

2309
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:36,420
The catacholamines,
noradrenaline, dopamine,

2310
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:39,780
and norepinephrine are
the bridge of activation

2311
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:42,380
for the immune system
and the nervous system.

2312
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,490
They are the way that the
nervous system calls out

2313
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:48,040
to the immune system,
"Aha, we have a problem.

2314
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,290
We need to counter this."

2315
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:53,050
So you can think of them,
them meaning dopamine,

2316
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,880
epinephrine, and norepinephrine,

2317
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:59,880
as being able to deploy larger
amounts of immune cells,

2318
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,100
all the types of immune
cells that we talked about

2319
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,120
at the beginning of the episode.

2320
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:09,080
Okay, so thus far, we've been
discussing how one can prevent

2321
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:12,720
getting sick or when
one starts to feel ill,

2322
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,710
how one might be able
to shorten the course

2323
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,420
of that infection by
ramping up the activity

2324
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,980
of the immune system.

2325
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,440
But what about when you're
already experiencing symptoms?

2326
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,830
The runny nose, stuffed
up nose, congestion,

2327
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:27,860
headache, et cetera.

2328
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:30,410
Well, there are many ways to address that

2329
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:31,590
at the symptom level.

2330
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:33,070
You're probably aware of all

2331
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:35,050
the over the counter medications,

2332
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:39,130
many of which focus on
the epinephrin system.

2333
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:43,160
Things that are of the
Sudafed variety prevent

2334
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,060
or reduce congestion because of the way

2335
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,540
that they cause release of epinephrin,

2336
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:52,190
and some of the effects on
dilating the bronchioles

2337
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:54,543
and dilating the nasal
passages and so forth.

2338
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:57,480
I'm not going to speak to whether or not

2339
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,240
those are good or bad choices.

2340
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:02,160
They do have a couple of
effects that are not so great

2341
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,660
for the course of treating
the underlying cause,

2342
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:09,150
which are first of all
they can cause dehydration.

2343
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:10,900
So you have to make sure
that you're hydrating well,

2344
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:13,580
both fluids and electrolytes,

2345
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:16,840
and they also can interfere with sleep

2346
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:20,350
because as I've talked about
in the episodes on sleep,

2347
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:22,710
one of the hallmarks of
deep sleep and in particular

2348
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:27,310
REM sleep is that epinephrin,
adrenaline levels are low.

2349
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:29,840
This is what allows you to have intense,

2350
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,770
often very emotionally-laden
dreams during REM sleep

2351
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:36,370
and not act those out.

2352
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:40,140
And low adrenaline,
epinephrin during REM sleep

2353
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:42,230
is basically a signature,

2354
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:44,330
a neurochemical signature
of the REM sleep state,

2355
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:47,560
which is so vital for
emotional and physical repair

2356
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,393
and so forth.

2357
01:43:48,393 --> 01:43:50,490
So, the fact that they can inhibit sleep,

2358
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:52,560
the fact that can cause dehydration,

2359
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,390
the fact that they can make
people feel kind of lightheaded

2360
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:57,410
and jittery makes them
not terrific choices

2361
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:59,040
for a number of people.

2362
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,150
There is an interesting
alternative choice.

2363
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:04,110
And when I say alternative,
I do mean alternative.

2364
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:06,660
The choice that I'm
referring to is spirulina,

2365
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:09,040
which is actually a form of algae.

2366
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,070
Years ago, I think when I
first heard about spirulina,

2367
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,937
it sounded very much of the kind of 1970s,

2368
01:44:14,937 --> 01:44:17,290
80s health food store variety.

2369
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:19,960
It seemed really kind
of mystical and wacky,

2370
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:22,450
but actually now there are
some really nice studies

2371
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:25,240
and some data, and also an
understanding of the mechanism

2372
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:28,010
by which spirulina can have potent effects

2373
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:29,930
in reducing what's called rhinitis,

2374
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:33,440
which is a fancy word for
congestion of the nose

2375
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,820
and an inflammation of the nose.

2376
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:39,820
Basically, anytime you hear
a word that includes "itis,"

2377
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,850
at least if it's in the
medical or health context,

2378
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:44,200
it generally means
inflammation of some tissue.

2379
01:44:45,490 --> 01:44:48,650
So rhinitis just being
inflammation of the nasal passages,

2380
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:50,530
but that's one of the most
uncomfortable symptoms

2381
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,080
of any kind of infection.

2382
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,330
So there are two studies
I'd like to highlight

2383
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,200
just very quickly.

2384
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:58,220
One is the effects of
spirulina on allergic rhinitis.

2385
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:00,020
And the other is a clinical comparison

2386
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:01,970
to the efficacy of spirulina platensis,

2387
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,802
that's a technical name,

2388
01:45:06,802 --> 01:45:10,630
and cetirizine for the
treatment of allergic rhinitis.

2389
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:13,590
These looked at humans, so
this is not a mouse study,

2390
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:14,890
this is a study on humans.

2391
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:18,820
Both sexes, so males and females.

2392
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:22,376
In one case, looking at 100
plus subjects, 129 subjects.

2393
01:45:22,376 --> 01:45:24,700
The other, 65 subjects, so
decent number of subjects,

2394
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,480
randomized trial, double blind.

2395
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:32,480
Both cases saw significant
decreases in nasal obstruction,

2396
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:36,233
improved ability to smell, improved sleep,

2397
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:42,313
daily working inflammatory
cytokines were reduced as well,

2398
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,460
reduction in nasal itching,

2399
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:46,340
all the stuff that you'd
like to experience,

2400
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:49,340
I can imagine, after taking two grams,

2401
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:52,770
two grams, not milligrams,
but two grams of spirulina.

2402
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:55,210
Sometimes had to be
taken for a short while

2403
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:56,760
before the effect kicked in.

2404
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,480
So, that's pretty impressive, I would say,

2405
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,320
but it doesn't really speak to mechanism,

2406
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:05,240
but in exploring the underlying
mechanisms for spirulina's

2407
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,280
effects on reducing rhinitis,

2408
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:12,560
it's interesting to find that
spirulina actually can inhibit

2409
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,570
the formation and/or activity of so-called

2410
01:46:15,570 --> 01:46:19,550
histaminergic mast cells,
M-A-S-T, mast cells.

2411
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:21,620
We haven't talked a lot about mast cells,

2412
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,800
but they are a very interesting cell type

2413
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,610
in the immune response.

2414
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:29,510
Essentially what they are, are
little packets of histamine.

2415
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:34,510
And when we have some sort
of injury or irritant rather

2416
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:40,290
to the skin, so a mosquito
bite, for instance,

2417
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:42,143
or poison oak or poison ivy,

2418
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:44,860
something that causes an itch

2419
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:47,080
or something that causes
inflammation internally,

2420
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,590
doesn't just have to be on the skin,

2421
01:46:48,590 --> 01:46:51,690
these mast are these little
bubbles that contain histamine

2422
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:53,850
that go to that site [hissing],

2423
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:56,200
and release their histaminergic contents

2424
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:00,270
and cause swelling and
inflammation of whatever cells

2425
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,403
are affected locally.

2426
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,530
You might think, well, why
would I want to have a mechanism

2427
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:06,760
in my body that would cause
swelling and inflammation?

2428
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:11,140
Ah, well then those cells in
turn send out cytokine signals

2429
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:15,010
that recruit the very cell
types that we were talking about

2430
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,640
way back at the beginning of the episode,

2431
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,470
the cells that are characteristics

2432
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:21,730
of the innate immune system that come in,

2433
01:47:21,730 --> 01:47:24,290
the macrophages and the
other types of cells

2434
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:26,960
that will come in and gobble
up the foreign invaders

2435
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,860
or will help sequester and move away,

2436
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:34,040
say the poison from a bite
or from whatever irritant.

2437
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:36,910
Again, it doesn't just have
to be at the skin surface.

2438
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:40,160
I'm describing an example of
at the skin, for instance,

2439
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,180
if you've ever had hives of any kind,

2440
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:47,060
that almost certainly involved mast cells.

2441
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:51,640
So, and when you take an
anti-histamine in order to deal

2442
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,540
with seasonal allergies, for instance,

2443
01:47:56,014 --> 01:47:57,970
you're taking a compound that's reducing

2444
01:47:57,970 --> 01:47:59,690
histamines in mast cells.

2445
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:02,750
And spirulina has also been
used quite effectively as a way

2446
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:06,330
to treat seasonal allergies
and some of the symptomatology.

2447
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:09,100
Equally on par with some
of the major prescription

2448
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:11,420
and over the counter drugs for that.

2449
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:15,480
One cautionary note, spirulina
can carry some side effects

2450
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:19,130
for people that have a genetic mutation

2451
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:20,350
leading to something called PKU.

2452
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:21,430
These people know who they are.

2453
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:24,650
They're very sensitive to phenylalanine.

2454
01:48:24,650 --> 01:48:26,520
These same people cannot drink any sort

2455
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:30,130
of NutraSweet or diet soda for
reasons that they understand.

2456
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:31,010
It can be quite dangerous.

2457
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:33,300
It's a rare genetic
disorder, but nonetheless,

2458
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,420
spirulina can be an
issue for those people.

2459
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:40,310
For most people, the side effect
profile is pretty minimal.

2460
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:42,070
And just to be clear, I
don't have any relationship

2461
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:43,750
to spirulina company or anything.

2462
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:46,480
I just find it interesting
that there are these compounds

2463
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:49,080
that sound rather, forgive the phrase,

2464
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,440
but rather new-agey because they come from

2465
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,140
a algae, from a plant.

2466
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:55,700
But when you look at the
underlying mechanism,

2467
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:57,010
it makes perfect sense.

2468
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:59,500
So that's often what we
like to point out here

2469
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,493
is that if there are these
so-called alternative therapies,

2470
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,040
alternative because most
people haven't heard of them,

2471
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,040
it's always nice if they map
to a specific logical mechanism

2472
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,880
and framework by which
that compound would work,

2473
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,527
as opposed to just some anecdote of,

2474
01:49:11,527 --> 01:49:13,520
"Oh, I hear spirulina
is great for allergies."

2475
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,900
Well, now we know why,
it inhibits mast cells

2476
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,810
and histaminergic mast
cells in particular.

2477
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:22,380
Earlier, I mentioned a new
and very exciting study

2478
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:24,570
published as a full article in "Nature."

2479
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:28,490
Full article means that
it is a major finding.

2480
01:49:28,490 --> 01:49:30,710
At the journal, "Nature,"
they have letters,

2481
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:32,120
which are important findings.

2482
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,630
They're still very high
stringency for getting

2483
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:36,610
a letter in "Nature" published.

2484
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:40,400
But the full articles, generally
there's only one or two

2485
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,730
per issue in the weekly
edition of "Nature."

2486
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:47,770
And just last week, there
was a very exciting article

2487
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:51,420
published from Qiufu Ma's lab
at Harvard Medical School.

2488
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:53,360
Qiufu I've known for a number of years.

2489
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,700
His group has done phenomenal
work on the mechanisms

2490
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:58,980
of itch and pain and discovering
some of the receptors

2491
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:00,370
and pathways for itch and pain.

2492
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:02,440
And more recently they've been exploring

2493
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:05,660
the mechanistic basis of acupuncture.

2494
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:07,627
And the title of the article is,

2495
01:50:07,627 --> 01:50:11,170
"A neuroanatomical basis for
electroacupuncture to drive

2496
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,130
the vagal adrenal axis."

2497
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:15,190
And while that's a mouthful,

2498
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:19,360
now most all of you are probably
familiar with what I mean

2499
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,540
when I say vagal adrenal axis;

2500
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,420
vagal meaning of the vagus,

2501
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:25,310
and adrenal of the adrenal glands.

2502
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:27,950
And so perhaps we should not be surprised,

2503
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:30,250
although excited, nonetheless,

2504
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:35,250
that when Qiufu's lab looked
at stimulation of the body

2505
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,802
with so-called electroacupuncture.

2506
01:50:38,802 --> 01:50:40,740
So, these are needles where a small bit

2507
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:43,190
of electrical current, low
level of electrical current,

2508
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:47,540
is passed into the needle
and therefore into the body.

2509
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:51,270
They located sites on the
body that can increase

2510
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:55,140
inflammation by way of releasing
inflammatory cytokines.

2511
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:57,630
These areas included the abdomen,

2512
01:50:57,630 --> 01:51:01,720
and they found areas on the
body such as the lower limbs,

2513
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,620
or the hind limbs in this case,

2514
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:07,370
that can stimulate the
vagal adrenal reflex

2515
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:10,790
and can lead to reduced inflammation.

2516
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:14,440
And what was really interesting
is that they figured out

2517
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:17,230
that it was activation of nerve endings

2518
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:19,120
that resided in the fascia.

2519
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,610
I mentioned earlier what fascia is,

2520
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:21,460
but just to remind you,

2521
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:25,210
the fascia is a really
thick sheath of tissue

2522
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:26,970
that surrounds muscle.

2523
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:28,581
If ever you've heard of Rolfing,

2524
01:51:28,581 --> 01:51:31,440
Rolfing is a form of very intense massage.

2525
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,560
I've never had this done,
but I've heard about this.

2526
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,070
It involves among other things,

2527
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:39,580
actually separating the muscle away

2528
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:40,840
from the fascia somewhat.

2529
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:43,490
So it's a very, very deep tissue massage.

2530
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:47,070
Actually a good friend
of mine who had this done

2531
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:48,410
told me that it was probably

2532
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:51,880
the most challenging physical experience

2533
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:53,250
that he had ever been
through going through

2534
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:54,260
this Rolfing procedure.

2535
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:57,150
Maybe some of you have have
been Rolfed, as they say,

2536
01:51:57,150 --> 01:51:59,030
and can report to the experience,

2537
01:51:59,030 --> 01:52:00,620
whether or not it was
pleasant or unpleasant,

2538
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:02,140
or you felt benefits or not.

2539
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:04,970
In any case, this study
isn't about Rolfing per se,

2540
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:06,550
but it is about the fascia.

2541
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:09,280
And so what they discovered
is there's a specific

2542
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:10,550
population of neurons.

2543
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:13,170
Those neurons have a name,
as they often do in science.

2544
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:15,260
Name isn't important, but
if you want to look it up,

2545
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:20,260
it's the PROKR2 neurons,
P-R-O-K R2 neurons.

2546
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:23,370
And they send a connection deep into

2547
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:26,070
the limb fascial tissue, okay?

2548
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:27,920
And then they send another connection,

2549
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,140
the connections we're
referring to are axons,

2550
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:30,973
neurons have axons.

2551
01:52:30,973 --> 01:52:34,310
So a wire in one direction that goes

2552
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:37,850
into the deep fascial
tissue of the lower limb,

2553
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,490
near the calf and thigh.

2554
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:44,050
And then they send another
wire up into the spinal cord,

2555
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:47,590
into a region of the hind
brain in the back of your brain

2556
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:51,170
kind of near your neck
in the medulla oblongata,

2557
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:53,570
that neuron also has a name
called the DMZ, doesn't matter.

2558
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:56,840
And that neuron connects
to the adrenal gland

2559
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,160
to release our good old
friends, the catacholamines,

2560
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:02,830
noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine,

2561
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:06,340
or norepinephrine,
epinephrin, and dopamine.

2562
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:11,340
And their release causes a
reduction in inflammation,

2563
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,170
even in response to an
injection of something called

2564
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:16,400
lipopolysaccharide, which
can actually induce fever.

2565
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,300
So, what does all this saying?

2566
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:21,490
This is saying that activation
of the deep fascial tissue

2567
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:26,490
causes a chain of neural
reactions that leads eventually

2568
01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:29,000
to the release of
norepinephrine, noradrenaline,

2569
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,310
adrenaline, and dopamine.

2570
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:33,480
And once again, lowers inflammation,

2571
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,910
very much like the breathing study

2572
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:37,650
that we talked about
earlier in the pattern

2573
01:53:37,650 --> 01:53:39,700
of cyclical hyperventilation
with retention,

2574
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,760
leading to reductions in inflammation.

2575
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,360
I can't tell you how happy this makes me.

2576
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,670
I had nothing to do with this work,

2577
01:53:44,670 --> 01:53:47,380
but the reason it makes
me happy is because

2578
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:51,150
I have a particular
fondness for when practices

2579
01:53:51,150 --> 01:53:53,280
that have existed for many centuries

2580
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:55,820
or even thousands of
years, such as acupuncture,

2581
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:00,380
such as respiration work,
start to converge with some

2582
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,770
of the hardcore mechanistic science.

2583
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:05,780
And the reason this excites
me is not because we want to

2584
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:08,580
take science and erase the previous tools

2585
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:11,680
and methods of these ancient
practices, not at all.

2586
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:13,770
And it certainly isn't
the case that we just want

2587
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:17,190
to name things or rename
things with modern science.

2588
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:20,890
What's very exciting is when
we can discover mechanism

2589
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:23,680
that explains why certain practices work.

2590
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:28,470
First of all, that validates
those as legitimate practices,

2591
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:31,270
maybe even insurance
will start to cover them,

2592
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:33,110
whereas maybe they previously had not,

2593
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:34,390
I don't know what the current status

2594
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:36,750
is for insurance coverage of acupuncture.

2595
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:38,500
I'm guessing there are places that do it,

2596
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,430
maybe others that don't.

2597
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:43,390
I personally am not somebody
who receives acupuncture.

2598
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:46,380
I have in the past, but it's
not that I'm in particular

2599
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,770
a fan of it, but I think that
there are a number of people

2600
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,790
that have benefited from it.

2601
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:51,640
So, I think that's wonderful.

2602
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:54,280
Breath work and respiration
work is something

2603
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:56,440
that I've cultivated as a
practice over the years.

2604
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:58,910
I mentioned earlier, how
I use it to push back

2605
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:00,760
on incoming infections and so forth.

2606
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,050
And now that doesn't sound like total...

2607
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:06,010
You know, like just a
figment of my imagination,

2608
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:06,970
there's actually a mechanism,

2609
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:09,140
a published mechanism to explain it.

2610
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:11,640
But the most exciting
thing to me about all this

2611
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:15,120
is that practices that
traditionally have been shrouded

2612
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,520
in complicated language
or were the unique domain

2613
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:21,210
of the practitioners and relied on phrases

2614
01:55:21,210 --> 01:55:23,870
like the meridians or the chakras,

2615
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:25,860
of which I think is
perfectly valid language,

2616
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:27,350
but doesn't inform mechanism.

2617
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:31,190
And then in a separate community,
the community I come from,

2618
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,440
the community of scientists,

2619
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:35,960
have used language like PROKR2 neurons,

2620
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,340
medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.

2621
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:40,760
And basically no one can
communicate with one another

2622
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,990
because the language is shrouding.

2623
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:46,590
What we're now starting to see
is that at their convergence

2624
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,160
is a common mechanism.

2625
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,670
And with that understanding,

2626
01:55:49,670 --> 01:55:52,490
what's going to be really terrific

2627
01:55:52,490 --> 01:55:55,100
is as new protocols start to emerge.

2628
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,390
So in understanding
mechanisms and pathways,

2629
01:55:57,390 --> 01:56:01,360
and in being able to understand
the base set of practices

2630
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,160
like breathing, like
electroacupuncture, and so forth,

2631
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:08,030
we can now start to daydream
in a very realistic way

2632
01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:10,330
about the development of new protocols,

2633
01:56:10,330 --> 01:56:11,700
more effective protocols.

2634
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:14,820
Protocols that perhaps one can
do at home without needles,

2635
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:17,270
perhaps protocols such as the breathing

2636
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:18,860
that you can do anywhere, anytime,

2637
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:21,997
and be confident that you're
actually impacting the IL-6

2638
01:56:21,997 --> 01:56:25,810
and the IL-8 pathways, reducing
those and increasing IL-10.

2639
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:29,210
So we are no longer
wandering around in the fog

2640
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:31,950
hearing about these magical
techniques without understanding

2641
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:34,950
why they work, nor are we
just seeing a bunch of science

2642
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:38,040
that is descriptive, but not mechanistic

2643
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,730
or pointing to specific protocols.

2644
01:56:39,730 --> 01:56:41,380
So, I'm just delighted.

2645
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,840
Again, I had nothing to do with this work,

2646
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:47,840
but really terrific work,
Qiufu and colleagues.

2647
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:50,250
And I also want to acknowledge a journal

2648
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:53,620
as prominent as "Nature"
for featuring this upfront,

2649
01:56:53,620 --> 01:56:55,610
because I think it really
does mark the beginning

2650
01:56:55,610 --> 01:56:58,960
of a new path in medicine.

2651
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:02,260
And just to underscore that
point a little bit further,

2652
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:03,610
the National Institutes of Health,

2653
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:05,810
of course has a cancer
institute, an eye institute,

2654
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:07,500
that deal with trying to combat cancer

2655
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,430
and to cure blindness and so forth.

2656
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:12,850
And now they have what's called NCCIH,

2657
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:14,610
which has complimentary health.

2658
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:18,100
And so, there are good
tax dollars being put

2659
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:20,160
to the kinds of explorations
that we're talking about

2660
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,310
that undoubtedly are going
to lead to better treatments

2661
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:26,520
for immunological diseases,
neurological diseases,

2662
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:29,040
the convergence of the immune
system and the nervous system.

2663
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:32,180
Very exciting times and I
hope that by learning about

2664
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,470
some of this new and emerging
science and hearing about

2665
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:38,760
some of the protocols that are
either zero cost or low cost,

2666
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,270
certainly for respiration that's the case

2667
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:43,130
or for the use of heat or cold,

2668
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:46,223
or maybe even electroacupuncture
if you have access to that,

2669
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,100
that we can really see that
we're starting to evolve

2670
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:52,310
as a field of health
and medicine and science

2671
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:53,300
and ancient practices,

2672
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,070
and that they're really
starting to converge

2673
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:56,440
and have a vector, as we say,

2674
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:59,170
in a new and more exciting direction.

2675
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:01,500
Once again, we've covered
a lot of information today.

2676
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:02,820
We learned about the immune system,

2677
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:05,370
the adaptive immune system,
the innate immune system,

2678
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:07,680
and the nervous system
and how those interact.

2679
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:10,740
And throughout, we discussed
protocols that can allow you

2680
01:58:10,740 --> 01:58:12,800
to tap into this relationship between

2681
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,670
the nervous system and immune system,

2682
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:18,280
and hopefully avoid
and/or shorten the course

2683
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:21,240
of any illnesses,
injuries, or inflammation

2684
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,000
that you might encounter.

at any level that you like.

2701
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:06,050
A few times during this episode,

2702
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:09,200
and in many previous episodes,
I mentioned supplements.

2703
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,810
Not everybody needs to take supplements,

2704
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:13,040
but many people find benefit from them.

2705
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:15,360
A key thing if you're going
to take supplements is to know

2706
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,990
that the quality of the
supplements that you're taking

2707
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:20,400
is very high and that's
not always the case

2708
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,540
with many supplement brands.

2709
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:25,380
That's why we partnered with
Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.

2710
01:59:25,380 --> 01:59:26,213
Thorne supplements are known to be

2711
01:59:26,213 --> 01:59:29,730
of the very highest
quality and the specificity

2712
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:31,690
of the ingredients is very high as well.

2713
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:32,860
Meaning what they list on the bottle

2714
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:34,910
is actually what's
contained in that bottle.

2715
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:36,100
They've worked with the Mayo Clinic,

2716
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:37,240
all the major sports teams.

2717
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:40,500
So, trust is very, very
high with Thorne products.

2718
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,070
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

2719
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:47,030
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

2720
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:49,280
And there, you can see all
the supplements that I take.

2721
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,600
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements.

2722
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:53,840
And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

2723
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,180
you can get 20% off any of the supplements

2724
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:57,030
that Thorne makes.

2725
01:59:57,030 --> 02:00:02,027
That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u/huberman,

2726
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:06,050
to see the supplements
that I take or get 20% off

2727
02:00:06,050 --> 02:00:08,160
any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

If you're not already following
HubermanLab on Instagram,

2729
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,180
please do so.

2730
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:15,040
There I teach neuroscience
and health-related topics,

2731
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,880
sometimes, but not always overlapping

2732
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:19,370
with the content of the podcast.

2733
02:00:19,370 --> 02:00:22,430
We are also HubermanLab on Twitter.

2734
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:24,620
And last but not least,

2735
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:26,208
thank you for your interest in science.
