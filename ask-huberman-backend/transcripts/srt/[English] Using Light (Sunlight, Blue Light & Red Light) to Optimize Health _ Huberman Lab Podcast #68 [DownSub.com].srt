1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,890
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,114
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:09,150
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,350
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,310
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,220
Today, we are going to discuss light

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,920
and the many powerful uses of
light to optimize our health.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,730
We're going to discuss the use of light

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,310
for optimizing skin health,
appearance, and longevity,

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,690
for wound healing, for
optimizing hormone balance,

13
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,729
and for regulating sleep, alertness, mood,

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,030
and even for offsetting dementia.

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,580
One of the reasons why light
has such powerful effects

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,270
on so many different
aspects of our biology

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,850
is that it can be translated
into electrical signals

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,140
in our brain and body,

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,660
into hormone signals
in our brain and body,

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,420
and indeed into what we call

21
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,610
cascades of biological pathways,

22
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,770
meaning light can
actually change the genes

23
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,720
that the cells of your bodies express.

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,170
And that is true throughout the lifespan.

25
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,800
Today, I will discuss the mechanisms

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,660
by which all of that occurs.

27
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,519
I promise to make it
clear for those of you

28
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,400
that don't have a biology background.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,350
And if you do have a biology background,

30
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,120
I'll try and provide sufficient depth

31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,070
so that it's still of interest to you.

32
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,300
And I promise to give you tools,

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,270
very specific protocols that are extracted

34
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,670
from the peer-reviewed literature

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,690
that will allow you to use
different so-called wave lengths,

36
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,770
which most of us think of as colors,

37
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,670
of light in order to modulate your health

38
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,030
in the ways that are
most important to you.

39
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,010
For those of you that are thinking

40
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,850
that the use of light to modulate health

41
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,720
falls under the category of woo science,

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,170
pseudoscience, or biohacking,

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,860
well, nothing could be
further from the truth.

44
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,360
In fact, in 1903, the Nobel
Prize was given to Niels Finsen,

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,750
he was Icelandic, he lived in Denmark,

46
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,850
for the use of phototherapy
for the treatment of lupus.

47
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,180
So there's more than a hundred
years of quality science

48
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,720
emphasizing the use of light,

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,420
and as you'll soon see, the
use of particular wavelengths

50
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,920
or colors of light in order
to modulate the activity

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,200
of cells in the brain and body.

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,060
So while it is the case that
many places and companies

53
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,410
are selling therapies and products

54
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,560
related to the use of flashing
lights and colored lights,

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,260
promising specific
outcomes from everything

56
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,080
from stem cell renewal to
improvement of brain function,

57
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,460
and some of those don't
have any basis in science,

58
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,530
there are photo therapies that
do have a strong foundation

59
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,530
in quality science,

60
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,530
and those are the
studies and the protocols

61
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,270
that we are going to discuss today.

62
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,290
But I thought that people
might appreciate knowing that

63
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,420
over a hundred years ago,

64
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,200
people were thinking
about the use of light

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,670
for the treatment of various diseases

66
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,810
and for improving health.

67
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,130
And indeed many of those
therapies are used today

68
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,570
in high quality hospitals
and research institutions

69
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,150
and, of course, clinics
and homes around the world.

70
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,250
One of the more exciting
examples of phototherapy

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,540
in the last few years

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,520
is the beautiful work of Dr. Glen Jeffery

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,260
at University College London.

74
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,300
The Jeffery Lab is known
for doing pioneering

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,380
and very rigorous research

76
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,450
in the realm of visual neuroscience.

77
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,710
And in the last decade or so,

78
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,020
they turned their attention
to exploring the role

79
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,780
of red light therapy for
offsetting age-related vision loss.

80
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,100
What they discovered is
that just brief exposures

81
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,000
to red light early in the day

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,960
can offset much of the vision loss

83
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,890
that occurs in people 40 years or older.

84
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,810
And what's remarkable about these studies

85
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,590
is that the entire duration of the therapy

86
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,010
is just one to three minutes,

87
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,130
done just a few times per week.

88
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,400
What's even more exciting

89
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,010
is that they understand the mechanism

90
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,000
by which this occurred.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
The cells in the back of the eye

92
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,230
that convert light information
into electrical signals

93
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,050
that the rest of the brain can understand

94
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,840
and create visual images from,

95
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,060
well, those cells are
extremely metabolically active.

96
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,870
They need a lot of ATP or energy.

97
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,390
And as we age,

98
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,570
those cells get less efficient

99
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,370
at creating that ATP and energy.

100
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,990
Exposure to red light early in the day,

101
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,090
and it does have to be early in the day,

102
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,960
allowed those cells to
replenish the mechanisms

103
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,980
by which they create ATP.

104
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,700
I'll talk about these experiments

105
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,360
in more detail later in the episode

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,010
and the protocols so that you
could apply those protocols

107
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,130
should you choose.

108
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,750
But I use this as an example
of our growing understanding

109
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,029
of not just that phototherapies
work but how they work.

110
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,870
And it is through the linking
of protocols and mechanism

111
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,140
that we, meaning all of us,

112
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,670
can start to apply phototherapies

113
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,450
in a rational, safe, and powerful way.

114
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,283
I'm pleased to announce

115
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:36,110
that I'm hosting two live events this May.

116
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,630
The first live event will be hosted

117
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,310
in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

118
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,930
The second live event will be hosted

119
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,310
in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.

120
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,310
Both are part of a lecture series entitled

121
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,900
The Brain Body Contract,

122
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,940
during which I will discuss
science and science-based tools

123
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,610
for mental health, physical
health, and performance.

124
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,630
And I should point out

125
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,840
that while some of the material I'll cover

126
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,690
will overlap with information covered here

127
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,107
on the Huberman Lab Podcast

128
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,140
and on various social media posts,

129
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,310
most of the information I will
cover is going to be distinct

130
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,200
from information covered on
the podcast or elsewhere.

131
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,730
So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

132
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,090
Portland on May 18th.

133
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,180
You can access tickets by
going to hubermanlab.com/tour.

134
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,640
And I hope to see you there.

135
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

136
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,690
that this podcast is separate

137
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,010
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

138
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,100
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

139
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,010
to bring zero cost to consumer information

140
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,140
about science and science-related tools

141
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,510
to the general public.

142
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,660
In keeping with that theme,

143
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,440
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

144
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,350
Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens, also called AG1.

145
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,290
I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,

146
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,710
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

147
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,390
The reason I started taking AG1

148
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,440
and the reason I still take
AG1 once or twice a day

149
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,240
is that it covers my foundational

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,540
vitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs.

151
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,990
It also has adaptogens
and things like zinc

152
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,700
for immune system function,

153
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,470
but the probiotics are one
of the key features in there.

154
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,790
I've done several podcasts
on the gut microbiome,

155
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,630
which are these trillions of microbiota

156
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,110
that live in our digestive tract,

157
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,090
and that are crucial
for our immune system,

158
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,493
brain function, and so on.

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
One way to enhance our gut microbiome

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,900
to ensure that it's healthy

161
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,600
is to make sure that we
get the correct probiotics.

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,330
And Athletic Greens has
the correct prebiotics

163
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,640
and probiotics that ensure
a healthy gut microbiome.

164
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,090
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

165
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,890
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

166
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,230
to claim a special offer.

167
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,760
They'll give you five free travel packs

168
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,810
that make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

169
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,680
while you're on the road,

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,170
so in the car and on the plane.

171
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,100
I should mention the
Athletic Greens is delicious.

172
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,933
I love the way it tastes.

173
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:36,990
I mix mine with some water

174
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,510
and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

175
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,710
This special offer is the
five free travel packs

176
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,610
plus a year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.

177
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,640
Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important

178
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,130
for a tremendous number
of biological functions.

179
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,530
Many of us who get sunlight
get enough vitamin D3.

180
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,610
Many of us, even if we do get sunlight,

181
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,540
do not get enough Vitamin D3.

182
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,560
So the year's supply of
vitamin D3 also has K2,

183
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
which is important for
cardiovascular function

184
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,090
for calcium regulation.

185
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,760
Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

186
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,110
to get the five free travel packs

187
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,680
and the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,240
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.

189
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,590
Thesis makes custom nootropics.

190
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,700
Nootropic is a smart drug.

191
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,520
And personally, I'm not a big fan

192
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,310
of the concept of a smart drug,

193
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,120
at least not the way that most people talk

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,503
about smart drugs or nootropics,
for the following reason.

195
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,610
Being smart involves various things.

196
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,610
There is creativity, there's focus,

197
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,580
there's task switching, and so on.

198
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,900
And each one of those
involves different operations

199
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,733
in the brain.

200
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,510
Different neural circuits,
different neurochemicals

201
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,970
have to be deployed in order for us to,

202
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,140
for instance, be very focused
or for us to be very creative

203
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,410
or for us to be able
to switch tasks easily.

204
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,750
Thesis understands this.

205
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,090
And for that reason, they've
developed custom nootropics

206
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,600
that are aimed at getting
your brain and body

207
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,390
into particular states for
particular types of work

208
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,970
or physical activity.

209
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,490
In order to accomplish that,
they've created unique blends

210
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,720
of high quality ingredients.

211
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,500
And each of those blends is designed

212
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,690
to get your brain and body
into a particular mode,

213
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,280
such as focus, clarity, or motivation.

214
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,340
I've been using Thesis nootropics
for over six months now.

215
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,380
And I have to say it's
been a total game changer

216
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,320
and very unique from the experience

217
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,150
of using sort of what I
call catchall nootropics.

218
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,920
So with Thesis, it's really directed

219
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,990
toward particular brain-body states.

220
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,823
I should also mention

221
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:25,150
that they tailor those
custom blends to you.

222
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,950
So by taking a quiz on their site,

223
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,300
they will tailor the blend to
you and your specific needs

224
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,660
and the things you don't want.

225
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,360
So if you want to try
your own personalized

226
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,250
nootropic starter kit,

227
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,890
you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.

228
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,140
You'll take a three-minute quiz,

229
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,179
and Thesis will send you
four different formulas

230
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,409
to try in your first month.

231
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,409
And then based on the outcomes with those,

232
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,520
they can update your formulations for you.

233
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,550
That's takethesis.com/huberman

234
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,190
and use the code Huberman at checkout

235
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,210
to get 10% off your first box.

236
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,800
Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.

237
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,370
LMNT is a properly
balanced electrolyte drink

238
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,370
that has no sugar.

239
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,860
When we get our electrolytes
in the proper ratios,

240
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,530
the cells of our brain and
body can function optimally.

241
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,090
Many people are surprised to find

242
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,160
that when they increase
their sodium intake,

243
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,130
provided that it is a proper balance

244
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,670
with potassium and magnesium,

245
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,070
they can think more clearly,

246
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,590
they recover from exercise better,

247
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,280
and they have more energy.

248
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,520
There is no surprise as to
how that all works, however.

249
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,890
Every cell of your body requires

250
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,210
the electrolytes to function.

251
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,490
And in particular, the
neurons of your brain and body

252
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,810
require sodium in order to function.

253
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,870
So while people with
pre-hypertension and hypertension

254
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,170
definitely need to be careful

255
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,950
about increasing their sodium intake,

256
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,820
many people do well to
increase their sodium intake,

257
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,050
again, provided it's in the proper balance

258
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,860
with potassium and magnesium.

259
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,280
LMNT provides that proper balance.

260
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,530
If you'd like to try LMNT,

261
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,900

267
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,900
Okay, let's talk about light.

268
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,520
First, I want to talk
about the physics of light,

269
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,010
and I promise to make that very clear,

270
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,800
even if you don't have
a background in physics.

271
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,660
And then I want to talk
about the biology of light,

272
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,710
meaning how light is
converted into signals

273
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,880
that your brain and body can use

274
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,310
to impact things like
organ health or disease,

275
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,000
or how it can use light

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,170
in order to repair particular organs,

277
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,120
like your skin, your eyes,
your brain, et cetera.

278
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,180
The physics of light
can be made very simple

279
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,880
by just illustrating a
few key bullet points.

280
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,170
The first bullet point

281
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,760
is that light is electromagnetic energy.

282
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,690
If the word electromagnetic
feels daunting to you,

283
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,900
well, then just discard that

284
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,690
and just think of light as energy

285
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,250
and think of energy as something

286
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,740
that can impact other
things in its environment.

287
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,130
Now, the way to imagine light

288
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,420
or to conceptualize light as energy

289
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,650
is that all around you light is traveling

290
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,610
in these little wavelengths.

291
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,230
And the reason, for those
of you that are watching,

292
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm making a little
wavey motion with my hand

293
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,010
is that's actually the way

294
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,060
that light energy moves in little waves.

295
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,790
Just like sound waves are coming at you

296
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,050
and impinging on your ears,

297
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,150
if you can hear me talking right now,

298
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,300
that is happening,

299
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,140
those are sound waves,

300
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,070
meaning the movement of
air particles out there

301
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,230
impacting your ear drum.

302
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,770
Well, light energy is just little bits

303
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,110
of electromagnetic energy
traveling through your environment

304
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,770
all the time in these little waves

305
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,770
and impinging on your brain
and body and eyes, et cetera.

306
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,240
And as I mentioned before,

307
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,760
energy can change the way
that other things behave.

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,230
It can cause reactions
in cells of your body.

309
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,040
It can cause reactions in
fruit, for instance, right?

310
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,350
You see a piece of
fruit and it's not ripe,

311
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,050
but it gets a lot of
sunlight and it ripens.

312
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,300
That's because the
electromagnetic energy of sunlight

313
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,420
had an impact on that plant or that tree,

314
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,320
or even on the fruit directly.

315
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,210
As a parallel example of energy

316
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,410
and its ability to impact other things,

317
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,800
we are all familiar with food

318
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,860
and the fact that food has calories.

319
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,460
Calorie is a measure of energy.

320
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,560
It has everything to do with
how much heat is generated

321
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,840
when you burn a particular
article of food,

322
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,870
believe it or not.

323
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,720
And it turns out that how hot
a given article of food burns

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,360
gives you a sense of how much energy

325
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,750
it can provide your body

326
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,960
in terms of your body's ability
to store or use that energy.

327
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,910
So again, think of light
as electromagnetic energy,

328
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,030
but really put that word
energy into capital letters,

329
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,950
embed that in your mind, going forward,

330
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,600
and you'll understand most
of the first bullet point

331
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,910
of what light is in terms
of the physics of light.

332
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,900
Now, the second thing that
you need to understand

333
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,130
about the physics of light

334
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,820
is that light has many
different wavelengths,

335
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,560
and the simplest way to conceptualize this

336
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,720
is to imagine that cover
of that Pink Floyd album,

337
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,790
where there's a prism.

338
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,720
You have a white beam of
light going into that prism.

339
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,210
And then the prism
splits that beam of light

340
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,130
into what looks like a rainbow.

341
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,690
So you got your reds,
your orange, your greens,

342
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,870
your blues, your purples, et cetera.

343
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,110
Anytime we have light in our environment,

344
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,770
that is so-called white light.

345
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,710
It includes all those wavelengths,

346
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,890
but sunlight and other forms of light

347
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,050
also have other wavelengths
of light that we can't see.

348
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,420
So when we think about the rainbow,

349
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,140
that's just the visible spectrum of light.

350
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,060
There are also wavelengths of light

351
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,470
that are not visible to us,

352
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,320
but that are visible
to some other animals,

353
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,170
and that can still impact
your brain and body

354
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,950
because there is still
energy at those wavelengths.

355
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,990
I'll give a few examples of this.

356
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,460
Humans are not a species that can see

357
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,430
into the infrared realm of the spectrum.

358
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,010
A pit viper, meaning a snake
that has infrared sensors,

359
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,950
however, can sense in the infrared.

360
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,030
So if you were to walk through a jungle

361
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,690
and there's a pit viper there,

362
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,390
it sees you as a cloud of heat emission

363
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,230
because your body is emitting
infrared energy all the time.

364
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,790
You're casting off infrared energy.

365
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,810
The snake can see it, you can't.

366
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,740
If you were to put on a
particular set of goggles

367
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,240
that were infrared goggles,

368
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,620
well, then you would be able
to see the heat emissions

369
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,060
of any organism, human or otherwise,

370
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,893
that could emit infrared energy.

371
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,980
Let's take the opposite
end of the spectrum.

372
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,350
We are familiar with seeing things

373
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,380
that are blue or green or very pale blue.

374
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,780
But as we say below that,

375
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,460
meaning even shorter
wavelength light is out there.

376
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,950
Ultraviolet light is a really
good example of light energy

377
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,987
that's coming from the sun
and is in our environment

378
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,760
and is being reflected
off surfaces all the time.

379
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,630
We don't see it.

380
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,440
And yet, if it's very bright outside,

381
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,320
that ultraviolet light can burn our skin.

382
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,140
As you'll learn in today's episode,

383
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,800
ultraviolet light can
also positively impact us.

384
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,780
In fact, I will describe a particular set

385
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,240
of new results that show
that ultraviolet light

386
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,210
viewed for just a few minutes each day,

387
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,630
or landing on the skin for
just a few minutes each day,

388
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,490
can actually offset a lot of pain.

389
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,370
It actually has the ability
to reduce the amount

390
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,990
of pain sensed by your body.

391
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,470
And we now understand the
specific circuits in the brain

392
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,230
and body that allow that to happen.

393
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,063
I'll talk about that

394
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:08,370
and the related protocols
a little bit later.

395
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,560
So the important thing to understand

396
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,880
about the physics of light

397
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,350
is that there's energy at all
these different wavelengths.

398
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,660
We only see some of those wavelengths,

399
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,070
which basically is to
say that light impacts us

400
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,380
at many different levels.

401
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,030
And the so-called levels
that I'm referring to

402
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,100
are the different wavelengths of light.

403
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
And you're welcome to think

404
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,770
of the different wavelengths
of light as different colors,

405
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,290
but do understand that there
are truly colors of light

406
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,240
that you and I can't see,

407
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,490
and yet that have powerful
impact on your brain and body.

408
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,500
Now, the third bullet point to understand

409
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,930
about the physics of light

410
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,270
is that different wavelengths of light,

411
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,940
because of the way that
their wave travels,

412
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,830
can penetrate tissues to different depths.

413
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,000
This is very, very important.

414
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,430
Today, we're going to talk a
lot about red light therapies

415
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,970
and near-infrared light therapies.

416
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,340
Those are so called longer wavelengths.

417
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,320
Longer wavelengths, just think

418
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,380
of a bigger, longer wave, right?

419
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,710
A bigger curve, as opposed
to short wavelength light,

420
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,820
which is going to be shorter, right?

421
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,210
A short wavelength
light would be something

422
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,763
like blue or green light
or ultraviolet light.

423
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,890
Blue, green, and ultraviolet light,

424
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,680
because its shortwave length light,

425
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,670
doesn't tend to penetrate
tissues very easily.

426
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,550
It has to do with the way
that the physics of light

427
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,820
interacts with the physical
properties of your skin

428
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,250
and other tissues of your body.

429
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,280
But basically, if you
were to shine UV light

430
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,030
onto your arm, for instance,

431
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,310
it could impact the skin
on the surface of the arm,

432
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,020
maybe some of the cells just
beneath the top layer of skin,

433
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,920
but it wouldn't penetrate much deeper.

434
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,980
Long wavelength light like red
light and near-infrared light

435
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,010
has this amazing ability to
penetrate through tissues,

436
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,320
including your skin.

437
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,490
And so if we were to shine red light

438
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,153
or near-infrared light onto your arm,

439
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,920
it would pass through
that top layer of skin.

440
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,490
It might impact it a little bit,

441
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,819
but it could penetrate
deeper into your skin,

442
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,029
not just to the skin layers,

443
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,700
but maybe even down to the bone,

444
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,569
maybe even down to the bone marrow.

445
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,859
And for many people, this
will be hard to conceptualize.

446
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,399
You think, "Well, wait,
I've got the skin there.

447
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,839
Doesn't the light just bounce off?"

448
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,979
And the answer is no,

449
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,569
because of the way that
long wavelength light

450
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,889
interacts with the absorbance
properties of your skin.

451
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,089
Absorbance properties are just the way

452
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,209
that the skin takes light energy

453
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,330
and converts it into a
different form of energy.

454
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,810
And your skin is not able to
take long wavelength light,

455
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,380
like red light and near-infrared
light, and absorb it.

456
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,670
But the tissues deeper in your body can.

457
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,220
So if you shine a red light
or near-infrared light

458
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,540
onto the surface of your skin,

459
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,140
you'll see a red glow there

460
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,470
as a reflectance on the
surface of your skin.

461
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,740
But a lot of the photon energy,

462
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,030
the light energy in
those longer wavelengths

463
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,880
is indeed passing through
those top layers of skin,

464
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,420
into the deeper layers of skin,

465
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,660
and can even make it into
the deep layers of your arm.

466
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,930
And as we start to transition
from the physics of light

467
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,963
to the biological impacts of light,

468
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,420
just understanding that the
different wavelengths of light

469
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,330
impact our tissues at different levels,

470
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,980
literally at different depths,

471
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,890
will help you better understand

472
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,260
how light of different colors,
of different intensities

473
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,660
and how long you are
exposed to those colors

474
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,530
and intensities of light can
change the way that the cells

475
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,740
and the organs of your body work.

476
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,060
And if it didn't sound weird enough

477
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,840
that you can pass light
through particular tissues

478
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,790
and have them land and be absorbed

479
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,510
at tissues deeper in your body,

480
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,560
well, it turns out that
different wavelengths of light

481
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,520
are also best absorbed by
particular so-called organelles

482
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,570
within your cells.

483
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,403
What are organelles?

484
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,280
Organelles are the different compartments

485
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,940
and different functions
within a given cell.

486
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,460
So for instance, your mitochondria,

487
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,367
which are responsible for generating ATP

488
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:53,903
and energy in your cells,

489
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,020
those exist at a particular depth,

490
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,610
at a particular location within a cell.

491
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,940
They're not all at the cell surface.

492
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,810
They sit somewhat deeper in the cell.

493
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,180
The nucleus of your
individual cells contains DNA,

494
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,160
and that sits at a
particular depth or location

495
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,043
within your cell.

496
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,740
Different wavelengths of light

497
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,520
not only can penetrate
down into different tissues

498
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,640
and into different cells of your body,

499
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,460
but they can also penetrate

500
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,570
and access particular organelles,

501
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,220
meaning mitochondria or the nucleus

502
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,070
or the different aspects of your cells

503
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,450
that are responsible
for different functions.

504
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,380
This is exquisitely important,
and it's exquisitely powerful

505
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,830
because as you'll learn today,

506
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,760
particular wavelengths
of light can be used

507
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,210
to stimulate the function
of particular organelles

508
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,040
within particular cells,

509
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,580
within particular organs of your body.

510
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,320
I can think of no other
form of energy, not sound,

511
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,840
not chemical energy, so not drugs,

512
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,840
not food, not touch, no form of energy

513
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,750
that can target the particular locations

514
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,720
in our cells, in our organelles,

515
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,770
in our organs and in our body,

516
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,440
to the extent that light can.

517
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,680
In other words, if you had to imagine

518
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,680
a real world surgical tool by
which to modulate our biology,

519
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,670
light would be the sharpest

520
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,860
and the most precise of those tools.

521
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,320
Now, let's talk about
how light is converted

522
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,090
into biological signals.

523
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,650
There's several ways in
which that is accomplished,

524
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,220
but the fundamental thing to understand

525
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,053
is this notion of
absorption of light energy.

526
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:30,460
Certain pigments or colors

527
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,830
in the thing that is
receiving the light energy,

528
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,410
meaning the thing that
the light energy lands on,

529
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,510
are going to absorb particular
wavelengths of light.

530
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,370
Now, I promise you that you
already intuitively know

531
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,740
how this works.

532
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,310
For instance, if you were to sit outside

533
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,190
on a very bright sunny day,

534
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,560
and you had a table in
front of you that was metal,

535
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,020
you might find it hard to
look down at that metal table

536
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,950
because it's reflecting a lot of light

537
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,250
of particular wavelengths.

538
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,040
If that table were pitch black, however,

539
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,570
it wouldn't reflect quite as much,

540
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,120
and you would be able to
comfortably look at at it.

541
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,900
If that table were red, it
might be somewhere in between.

542
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,870
If that table were green,

543
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,730
it would be also somewhere in between,

544
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,550
but let's say it were very light blue.

545
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,760
Well, then it might reflect
almost as much as a table

546
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
that were just metal or
a white table surface.

547
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,460
So the absorbance properties
of a given surface

548
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,230
will determine whether or not
light energy goes and stays

549
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,310
at that location and has
an impact on that location

550
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,233
or whether or not it bounces off.

551
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,760
Every biological function of light

552
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,080
has to do with the absorbance
or the reflectance of light

553
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,820
or light passing through
that particular thing,

554
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,983
meaning that particular cell
or compartment within a cell.

555
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,560
I'd like to make it clear how this works

556
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,870
by using the three primary examples

557
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,960
of how you take light in your environment

558
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,643
and convert it into biological events.

559
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,990
We have photoreceptors
in the back of our eyes.

560
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,720
These photoreceptors
come in two major types,

561
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,380
the so-called rods and the cones.

562
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,120
The rods are very elongated,
they look like rods.

563
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,010
And the cones look like little triangles.

564
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,840
Rods and cones have
within them photopigment.

565
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,340
They have dark stuff that's
stacked up in little layers.

566
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,410
Rods absorb light of
essentially any wavelength.

567
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,760
There's some variation to that,

568
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,060
but let's just say rods don't care

569
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,930
about the different colors of light.

570
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,730
They will absorb light
energy, photon energy,

571
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,030
if it's red, if it's green, if it's blue,

572
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,100
if it's yellow, doesn't matter,

573
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,210
as long as that light is bright enough.

574
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,530
And it turns out that rods
are very, very sensitive.

575
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,810
They can detect very, very
small numbers of photons.

576
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,190
And rods are essentially what you use

577
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,430
to see in very low light conditions.

578
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,470
We'll return more to vision later.

579
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,950
The cones come in three major varieties.

580
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,990
At least for most people
who aren't colorblind,

581
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,330
you have so-called red cones,
green cones, and blue cones.

582
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,850
But they're not really
red, green, and blue

583
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,940
in the back of your eye.

584
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,180
They are cones that either absorb

585
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,020
long wavelength light, red,

586
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,120
that absorb medium
wavelength light, green,

587
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,203
or short wavelength light, blue.

588
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,290
The reason that they can absorb

589
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,640
different wavelengths of light

590
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,770
is they have different photopigments.

591
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,960
So much as the example I gave before,

592
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,630
where you have different tables outside

593
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,820
in the sunny environment,

594
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,700
and some are reflecting
light more than others,

595
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,500
others are absorbing
light more than others,

596
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,310
well, so too, the photoreceptors,
meaning the cones,

597
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,310
are absorbing light of
different wavelengths

598
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,760
to different extents.

599
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,600
And in an absolutely incredible way,

600
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,030
your brain is actually able
to take that information

601
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,420
and create this perception
that we have of color.

602
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,870
But that's another story altogether

603
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,510
that we'll just touch on
a little bit more later,

604
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,070
but that if you want to learn all about,

605
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,893
you can go to our episode on vision.

606
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,790
So that's photoreceptors
in the back of your eye,

607
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,150
absorbing light of different
wavelengths, rods, and cones.

608
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,210
The other place, of course,

609
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,010
where light can impact our body

610
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,670
is on our surface, on our skin.

611
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,670
And skin has pigment too.

612
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,010
We call that pigment melanin.

613
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,890
We have within our skin
multiple cell types,

614
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,100
but in the top layer of skin,
which is called the epidermis,

615
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,400
we have keratinocytes,
and we have melanocytes.

616
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,740
And the melanocytes are the cells

617
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,390
that create pigmentation of the skin.

618
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,800
And of course there is wide
variation in the degree

619
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,200
to which there is
pigmentation of the skin,

620
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,630
which has to do with genetics,

621
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,140
also has to do with where
you were born and raised,

622
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,760
how much light exposure you
have throughout the year, right?

623
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,040
So people toward the equator

624
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,940
tend to have more melanocyte activity

625
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,410
than people who are
located at the North Pole.

626
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,300
And of course, people live
at different locations

627
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,133
throughout the Earth,

628
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,960
regardless of their genetic background

629
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,890
or where they were born.

630
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,420
And so, as you all know,
with light exposure,

631
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,600
those melanocytes will
turn on genetic programs

632
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,410
and other biological programs

633
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,770
that lead to enhanced
pigmentation of the skin,

634
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,770
which we call tanning.

635
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,750
The way they do that is by
absorbing UV light specifically.

636
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,230
So with melanocytes,

637
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,630
we have a very specific example

638
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,330
of how a pigment absorbs
light of a particular length,

639
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,250
in this case, ultraviolet
shortwave length light,

640
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,910
which in turn creates a
set of biological signals

641
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,590
within those cells that
in turn creates changes

642
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,040
in our skin pigmentation.

643
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,333
So we have photoreceptors,
we have melanocytes.

644
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,290
And the third example I'd like to provide

645
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,620
is that of every cell of your body.

646
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,380
And what I mean by that is
that every cell of your body,

647
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,590
meaning a cell that is
part of your bone tissue

648
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,800
or your bone marrow or heart
tissue or liver or spleen,

649
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,560
if light can access those cells,

650
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,830
it will change the way
that those cells function

651
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,363
for better or for worse.

652
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,680
For many organs within our body

653
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,110
that reside deep to our skin,

654
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,360
light never arrives at those cells.

655
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,690
A really good example of this

656
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,440
that we'll touch on later is the spleen.

657
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,590
Unless you have massive
damage to your body surface,

658
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,790
unless you literally
have a hole in your body,

659
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,100
light will never land
directly on your spleen,

660
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,800
but the spleen still
responds to light information

661
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,140
through indirect pathways.

662
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,420
And those indirect pathways arise

663
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,230
through light arriving on the skin

664
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,650
and light arriving on the eyes.

665
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,810
So a key principle

666
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,570
that I'm going to return
to again and again today

667
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,630
is that the ways in which
light can impact the biology

668
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,640
of your organelles, your cells,

669
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,530
your organs, and the tissues,
and indeed your whole body,

670
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,410
can either be direct,

671
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,280
so for instance, light onto
your skin impacting skin

672
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,830
or light onto your photoreceptors

673
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,100
impacting the photoreceptors of your eye,

674
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,920
or it can be indirect.

675
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,950
It can be light arriving
on your photoreceptors,

676
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,910
the photoreceptors then
informing another cell type,

677
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,780
which informs another cell type,

678
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,220
which then relays a signal

679
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,620
in kind of a bucket brigade manner

680
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,577
off to the spleen and says to the spleen,

681
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:10,400
"Hey, there's a lot of UV light out here.

682
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,110
We're actually under stress.

683
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,730
In fact, there's so much UV light

684
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,750
that you need to activate
an immune program

685
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,150
to protect the skin."

686
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,210
And in response to that,

687
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,960
the spleen can deploy certain
signals in certain cell types

688
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,640
to go out and start repairing skin

689
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,440
that's being damaged by UV light.

690
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,420
So we have direct signals
and we have indirect signals,

691
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,000
but in every case,

692
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,310
it starts with light of
particular wavelengths

693
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,920
being absorbed by particular
pigments or properties

694
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,330
of the surfaces that
those light waves land on.

695
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,870
And as you recall from our discussion

696
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,640
about the physics of light, remember,

697
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,500
it's not just about light impinging

698
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,590
on the surface of your body.

699
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,980
Light can actually
penetrate deep to the skin

700
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,830
and access at least certain
tissues and cells of your body.

701
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,430
Even though you can't see
those wavelengths of light,

702
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,020
they are getting into you all the time.

703
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,110
So perhaps the best way
to wrap this discussion

704
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,150
about the physics and the biology of light

705
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,850
with a bit of a bow

706
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,270
is to think about light as a transducer,

707
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,930
meaning a communicator of what's going on

708
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,760
in the environment around you

709
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,150
and that some of those signals
are arriving at the surface

710
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,270
and impacting the surface of your body.

711
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,100
But many of those signals
are being taken by cells

712
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,830
at the surface of your body,

713
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,630
meaning your melanocytes in your skin

714
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,480
and the photoreceptors of your eyes,

715
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,350
and then being passed off
as a set of instructions

716
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,760
to the other organs and
tissues of your body.

717
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,980
Light can impact our biology in very fast,

718
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,520
moderately fast, and slow ways.

719
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,230
But even the slow ways in which
light can impact our biology

720
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,370
can be very powerful
and very long-lasting.

721
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,770
Just as a quick example
of the rapid effects

722
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,950
of light on our biology,

723
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,360
if you were to go from a room
that is dimly lit or dark

724
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,110
into a very brightly lit room,

725
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,600
you would immediately feel very alert.

726
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,990
You might say, "No, that's the not true.

727
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,080
Sometimes I wake up and it's
dark, and I kind of stumble out

728
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,030
and it's lighter out in the next room.

729
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,530
And it takes me a while to wake up."

730
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,080
Ah, but if we were to move you from a room

731
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,100
that was very dark to very bright,

732
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,890
a signal conveyed from your eyes

733
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,170
to an area of your brain stem
called the locus coeruleus

734
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,780
would cause the release of adrenaline

735
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,520
similar to the release of adrenaline

736
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,010
if you were to be dropped
into very, very cold water

737
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,910
all of a sudden.

738
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,550
Just an immediate wake-up
signal to your brain and body.

739
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,900
So that's an example of a rapid effect

740
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,550
of light on your biology,

741
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,760
not a very typical one, but nonetheless,

742
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,543
one that has a hardwired
biological mechanism.

743
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,560
At the other end of the spectrum

744
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,490
are what we call slow
integrating effects of light

745
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,980
on our biology.

746
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,320
So what I mean by that are
ways in which your body

747
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,640
is taking information about
light in the environment,

748
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,760
not in the sort of snapshot, acute sense,

749
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,540
but averaging the amount of
light in your environment.

750
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,280
And that average light information

751
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,970
is changing the way
that your biology works.

752
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,650
But even though this is a slow process,

753
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,490
as I mentioned before,
it's a very powerful one.

754
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,530
The primary example of this

755
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,340
are so-called circannual rhythms.

756
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,880
Circannual rhythms are
literally a calendar

757
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,450
that exists within your
body that uses not numbers,

758
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,870
but amounts of hormone that are released

759
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,870
into your brain and body
each day and each night

760
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,130
as a way of knowing where you are

761
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,560
in the 365-day calendar year.

762
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,960
Now that might seem kind of
crazy, but it's not crazy.

763
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,070
The Earth travels around
the sun once every 365 days.

764
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,143
And depending on where you are
on the Earth, where you live,

765
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,920
you are going to get more or
less light each day on average,

766
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,560
depending on the time of year.

767
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,850
So if you're in the Northern Hemisphere,

768
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,940
in the winter months, days are
shorter, nights are longer.

769
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,040
In the summer months, days are
longer, nights are shorter.

770
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,100
And of course, things
change whether or not you're

771
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,700
in the Northern Hemisphere
or the Southern Hemisphere,

772
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,640
but nonetheless in short
days you have more darkness,

773
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,880
that's obvious.

774
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,680
And if you understand that
light arriving on the eyes

775
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,190
is absorbed by a particular cell type

776
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,050
called the intrinsically
photosensitive ganglion cell.

777
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,883
It's just a name.

778
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:31,190
You don't need to know
the name, but if you want,

779
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,350
it's the so-called intrinsically

780
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,480
photosensitive ganglion cell,

781
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,330
also called the melanopsin cell

782
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,810
because it contains an opsin,

783
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:41,810
a photopigment that absorbs
shortwave length light

784
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,730
that arrives through sunlight.

785
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,510
Those cells communicate to
particular stations in the brain

786
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,680
that in turn connect to
your so-called pineal gland,

787
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,430
which is this little pea-sized gland

788
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,700
in the middle of your brain

789
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,650
that releases a hormone called melatonin.

790
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,450
And the only thing you
need to know is that light

791
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,210
activates these particular cells,

792
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,550
the intrinsically
photosensitive melanopsin cells,

793
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,460
which in turn shuts down
the production of melatonin

794
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,653
from the pineal gland.

795
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,910
If you think about this
in terms of the travel

796
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,980
of the Earth around the
sun across the year,

797
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,600
what it means is that in short days,

798
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,080
because there's very
little light on average

799
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,713
landing on these cells,

800
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,170
the duration of melatonin
release will be much longer

801
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,860
because as I mentioned
before, light inhibits,

802
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,580
it shuts down melatonin.

803
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,100
Whereas in the summer months,
much more light on average

804
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,580
will land on your eyes, right?

805
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,010
Because days are longer.

806
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,450
Even if you're spending more time indoors,

807
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,540
on average, you're going to get more light

808
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,160
to activate these cells.

809
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,207
And because light shuts
down melatonin production,

810
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:51,320
what you'll find is that the
duration of melatonin release

811
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,420
for the pineal is much shorter.

812
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,510
So melatonin is a transducer.

813
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,630
It's a communicator of
how much light on average

814
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,000
is in your physical environment.

815
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,090
What this means is

816
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,460
for people living in
the Northern Hemisphere,

817
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,580
you're getting more melatonin
release in the winter months

818
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,680
than you are in the summer months.

819
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,680
So you have a calendar system
that is based in a hormone,

820
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
and that hormone is using
light in order to determine

821
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,200
where you are in that
journey around the sun.

822
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,100
Now, this is beautiful.

823
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,540
At least to me, it's beautiful

824
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,900
because what it means is that
the environment around us

825
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,870
is converted into a signal

826
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,900
that changes the environment within us.

827
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,820
That signal is melatonin,

828
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,220
and melatonin is well known for its role

829
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,950
in making us sleepy each night

830
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,810
and allowing us to fall asleep.

831
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,250
Many of you have probably heard before,

832
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,930
I am not a big fan of
melatonin supplementation

833
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,200
for a number of reasons,
but just as a quick aside,

834
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,390
the levels of melatonin
that are in most supplements

835
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,520
are far too high to really
be considered physiological.

836
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,210
They are indeed super
physiological in most cases,

837
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,960
and melatonin can have a
number of different effects,

838
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,170
not just related to sleep,

839
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,730
but that's supplemented melatonin.

840
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,400
Here, I'm talking about
our natural production

841
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,500
and release of melatonin

842
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,793
according to where we are in
the 365-day calendar year.

843
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,080
Endogenous melatonin,
meaning the melatonin

844
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,960
that we make within our bodies naturally,

845
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,610
not melatonin that's supplemented,

846
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,800
has two general categories of effects.

847
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,179
The first set of effects are
so called regulatory effects

848
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,939
and the others are protective effects.

849
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,830
The regulatory effects are for instance,

850
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,580
that melatonin can
positively impact bone mass.

851
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,350
So melatonin can, for instance,

852
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,850
turn on the production of osteoblasts,

853
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,870
which are essentially stem
cells that make more bone for us

854
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,460
that make our bones stronger

855
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,093
and that can replace
damaged aspects of our bone.

856
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,250
Melatonin is also involved in maturation

857
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,889
of the gonads during puberty,
the ovaries and the testes.

858
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,650
Although there, the effects of melatonin

859
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,330
tend to be suppressive on maturation

860
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,820
of the ovaries and testes,

861
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,660
meaning high levels of melatonin

862
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,560
tend to reduce testicle volume

863
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,920
and reduce certain
functions within the testes,

864
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,630
including sperm production
and testosterone production.

865
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,730
And within the ovaries,
melatonin can suppress

866
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,630
the maturation of eggs, et cetera.

867
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,080
Now, I don't want anyone to get scared

868
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,590
if you've been taking melatonin.

869
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,830
Most of the effects of melatonin

870
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,220
on those functions are reversible,

871
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,310
but I should point out
that one of the reasons

872
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,670
why children don't go into
puberty until a particular age

873
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,080
is that young children

874
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,790
tend to have chronically
high endogenous melatonin.

875
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,410
And that is healthy to
keep them out of puberty

876
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,740
until it's the right time
for puberty to happen.

877
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,440
So melatonin can increase bone mass,

878
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,890
but reduces gonad mass, so to speak.

879
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,770
It's going to have varying effects

880
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,247
depending on the ratios and
levels of other hormones

881
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:53,260
and other biological events in the body.

882
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,170
But as you can see,

883
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,570
melatonin has these powerful
regulatory on other tissues.

884
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,910
I should also mention that
melatonin is a powerful modulator

885
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,160
of placental development.

886
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,520
So for anyone that's pregnant,

887
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,880
if you're considering
melatonin supplementation,

888
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,560
please, please, please
talk to your OB/GYN,

889
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,010
talk to your other doctor as well.

890
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,410
You want to be very, very cautious

891
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,690
because of the powerful
effects that melatonin can have

892
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,950
on the developing fetus and placenta.

893
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,050
For people that are not
pregnant, in fact, all people,

894
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,690
melatonin has a powerful effect

895
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,990
on the central nervous system as a whole.

896
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,020
Your brain and spinal cord
are the major components

897
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,480
of your central nervous system ,

898
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,193
and melatonin, because it's
associated with darkness,

899
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,240
which is just another way of saying

900
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,897
that light suppresses melatonin,

901
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:39,230
melatonin is thereby
associated with the dark phase

902
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,693
of each 24-hour cycle,

903
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,890
it can have a number of different effects

904
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,380
in terms of waking up or making
our body feel more sleepy.

905
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,460
And it does that by way of impacting cells

906
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,490
within our nervous system,

907
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,090
literally turning on certain brain areas,

908
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,620
turning off other brain areas.

909
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,110
And it does that through a whole cascade

910
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,520
of biological mechanisms,

911
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,510
a bit too detailed to get into today.

912
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,040
So melatonin is regulating
how awake or asleep we are.

913
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,980
It tends to make us more
asleep, incidentally.

914
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,880
It's regulating our timing of puberty,

915
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,340
and it's regulating how our gonads,

916
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,940
the testes and ovaries, function,

917
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,830
even in adulthood, to some extent.

918
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,460
And it's regulating bone mass.

919
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,293
As I mentioned before,

920
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:20,510
melatonin also has protective effects.

921
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,210
It can activate our immune system.

922
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,550
It is among the most potent antioxidants.

923
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,180
So it is known to have
certain anti-cancer properties

924
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,670
and things of that sort,

925
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,170
which is not to say that you
simply want more melatonin.

926
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,900
I think a lot of people get misled

927
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,180
when they hear something like,

928
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,010
melatonin has anti-cancer properties.

929
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,500
That doesn't mean that cranking
up the levels of melatonin

930
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,670
by supplementing it, or by
spending time in darkness

931
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,560
and not getting any light,

932
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,823
which would, of course, inhibit melatonin,

933
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:48,540
is going to be beneficial
for combating cancer.

934
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,590
That's not the way it works.

935
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,050
It is actually the rise
and fall of melatonin

936
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,690
every 24-hour cycle

937
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,510
and the changes in the duration
of that melatonin signal

938
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,870
throughout the seasons

939
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,340
that has these anti-cancer
and antioxidant effects.

940
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,140
So when we think about
light impacting our biology,

941
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,700
the reason I bring up melatonin

942
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,340
as the primary example of that

943
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,953
is A, because melatonin impacts
so many important functions

944
00:38:12,953 --> 00:38:14,460
within our brain and body,

945
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,870
but also because hormones
in general, not always,

946
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,270
but in general, are responsible

947
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:22,730
for these slow modulatory
effects on our biology.

948
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,840
And so I'm using this as an example

949
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,780
of how light throughout the year

950
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,290
is changing the way
that the different cells

951
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,100
and tissues and organs
of your body are working,

952
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,340
and that melatonin is the
transducer of that signal.

953
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,173
So at this point,

954
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:38,090
we can say light powerfully
modulates melatonin,

955
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,720
meaning it shuts down melatonin.

956
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,470
Melatonin is both beneficial
for certain tissues

957
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,280
and suppressive for other
tissues and functions.

958
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,820
What should we do with this information?

959
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,890
Well, it's very well established now

960
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,130
that one of the best
things that we can all do

961
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,630
is to get the proper amount
of sunlight each day.

962
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,370
And by proper, I mean appropriate
for that time of year.

963
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,600
So in the summer months
where the days are longer

964
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,820
and nights are shorter,

965
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,250
we would all do well to get
more sunlight in our eyes.

966
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,140
And again, it's going to be to our eyes

967
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,980
because as you recall,

968
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,270
the pineal sits deep in the brain,

969
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,360
and light can't access
the pineal directly,

970
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,870
at least not in humans.

971
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,650
So in order to get light
information to the pineal

972
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,200
and thereby get the
proper levels of melatonin

973
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,610
according to the time of year,

974
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,960
we should all try and get
outside as much as possible

975
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,200
during the long days of summer and spring.

976
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,060
And in the winter months, it makes sense

977
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,760
to spend more time indoors.

978
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,840
For those of you that suffer

979
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,200
from seasonal effective disorder,

980
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,490
which is a seasonal depression,

981
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,220
or feel low during the
fall and winter months,

982
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,340
there are ways to offset this.

983
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,920
We did an entire episode on
mood and circadian rhythms

984
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,150
where we described this.

985
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,500
So it does make sense for some people

986
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,970
to get more bright light in
their eyes early in the morning

987
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,050
and throughout the day during
the winter months as well.

988
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,420
But nonetheless, changes in melatonin,

989
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,090
meaning changes in the duration

990
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,120
of melatonin release across the
year are normal and healthy.

991
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,800
So provided that you're not
suffering from depression,

992
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,570
it's going to be healthy to
somewhat modulate your amount

993
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,690
of indoor and outdoor
time across the year.

994
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,270
The other thing to understand

995
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,080
is this very firmly established fact,

996
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,173
which is light powerfully
inhibits melatonin.

997
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,010
If you wake up in the middle of the night,

998
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,360
and you go into the bathroom
and you flip on the lights,

999
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,520
and those are very bright,
overhead, fluorescent lights,

1000
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,090
your melatonin levels,

1001
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,210
which would ordinarily be quite high

1002
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,043
in the middle of the night

1003
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:33,850
because you've been eyes
closed in the dark, presumably,

1004
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,040
will immediately plummet
to near zero or zero.

1005
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,080
We would all do well
regardless of time of year

1006
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,410
to not destroy our melatonin
in the middle of the night

1007
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,420
in this way.

1008
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,990
So if you need to get up
in the middle of the night

1009
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,823
and use the restroom,

1010
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,920
which is a perfectly normal
behavior for many people,

1011
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,990
use the minimum amount of light required

1012
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,120
in order to safely move
through the environment

1013
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,620
that you need to move through.

1014
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,480
Melatonin needs to come
on early in the night.

1015
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,330
It actually starts rising in
the evening and towards sleep.

1016
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,250
But then as you close your
eyes and you go to sleep,

1017
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,720
melatonin levels are
going to continue to rise

1018
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,630
at least for several hours into the night.

1019
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,250
Again, if you get up in
the middle of the night,

1020
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,950
really try hard not to flip
on a lot of bright lights.

1021
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,500
If you do that every once in a while,

1022
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,060
it's not going to be a problem.

1023
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,010
But if you're doing
that night after night,

1024
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,490
you are really disrupting
this fundamental signal

1025
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,030
that occurs every night,

1026
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,130
regardless of winter,
spring, summer, et cetera.

1027
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,530
And that is communicating information

1028
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,100
about where your brain and
body should be in time.

1029
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,920
And I know that's a little
bit of a tricky concept,

1030
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,880
but really our body is
not meant to function

1031
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,380
in the same way during the winter months,

1032
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,570
as the summer months.

1033
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,030
There are functions that
are specifically optimal

1034
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,670
for the shorter days of winter.

1035
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,840
And there are functions that
are specifically optimal

1036
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
for the longer or days of summer.

1037
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,560
So again, try to avoid bright
light exposure to your eyes

1038
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,610
in the middle of the night.

1039
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,610
And for those of you that
are doing shift work,

1040
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,140
what I can say is try and
avoid getting bright light

1041
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,100
in your eyes in the middle
of your sleep cycle.

1042
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,470
So even if you're sleeping
in the middle of the day,

1043
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,770
because you have to work at night,

1044
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:11,210
if you wake up during that about of sleep,

1045
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,390
really try hard to limit
the amount of light,

1046
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,610
which is going to be harder
for shift workers, right?

1047
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,450
Because there are generally
a lot more lights on

1048
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,540
and bright lights outside,

1049
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,100
so you would want to close the blinds

1050
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,420
and limit artificial light inside.

1051
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,980
One way to bypass some
of the inhibitory effects

1052
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,450
of light on melatonin

1053
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,010
is to change your physical environment

1054
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,040
by, for instance, dimming the lights.

1055
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,030
That's one simple way, very low-cost way.

1056
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,810
In fact, you'll save money
by dimming the lights

1057
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,750
or turning them off.

1058
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,170
The other is if you
are going to use light,

1059
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,870
using long wavelength light,
because, as you recall,

1060
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,090
these intrinsically
photosensitive melanopsin cells

1061
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,770
within your retina that convey the signal

1062
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,070
about bright light in your environment

1063
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,780
to impact melatonin,
to shut down melatonin,

1064
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,890
respond to short wavelengths of light.

1065
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,900
So red light is long wavelength light.

1066
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,800
You now understand that
from our discussion

1067
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,660
about the physics of light.

1068
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,450
And if you were to use
amber-colored light or red light

1069
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,730
and even better, dim
amber or dim red light

1070
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,563
in the middle of the night,

1071
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:11,130
well, then you would probably
not reduce melatonin at all

1072
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,070
unless those red lights and amber lights

1073
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,120
are very, very bright.

1074
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,310
Any light, provided it's bright enough,

1075
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,900
will shut down melatonin production.

1076
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,757
One final point about melatonin,

1077
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:24,010
and this relates to melatonin
supplementation as well,

1078
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:25,960
is that now that you understand

1079
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,110
how potently melatonin can impact things

1080
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,950
like cardiovascular
function, immune function,

1081
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,280
anti-cancer properties, bone mass,

1082
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,370
gonad function, et cetera,

1083
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,710
you can understand why it would make sense

1084
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,010
to be cautious about
melatonin supplementation,

1085
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,530
because supplementation
tends to be pretty static.

1086
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,490
It's X number of milligrams per night,

1087
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,350
whereas normally endogenously
the amount of melatonin

1088
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,450
that you're releasing each night

1089
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,170
is changing according to time of year,

1090
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,370
or if you happen to live in an area

1091
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,970
where there isn't much change
in day length across the year,

1092
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,190
so for instance, if you
live near the equator,

1093
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,730
well, then your body is accustomed
to having regular amounts

1094
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,050
of melatonin each night.

1095
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,210
When you start supplementing melatonin,

1096
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,280
you start changing the total
amount of melatonin, obviously,

1097
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,280
but you're also changing
the normal rhythms

1098
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,030
in how much melatonin is being released

1099
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,360
into your brain and body

1100
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,050
across the 365-day calendar year.

1101
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,230
So while I'm somebody

1102
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,020
who readily embraces
supplementation in various forms,

1103
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,410
for things like sleep
and focus, et cetera,

1104
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,100
when it comes to melatonin,
I'm extremely cautious.

1105
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,610
And I think it's also
one of the few examples

1106
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,860
where a hormone is available
without prescription,

1107
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,693
over the counter.

1108
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:38,700
You just go into a pharmacy
or drugstore or order online,

1109
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,410
this hormone, which is known

1110
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,910
to have all these powerful effects.

1111
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,358
So I get very, very concerned

1112
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,720
when I hear about people taking melatonin,

1113
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,430
especially at the levels that are present

1114
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,600
in most supplements.

1115
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,630
It's been recognized for a very long time,

1116
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,590
and in fact, there are now
data to support the fact

1117
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,630
that animals of all
kinds, including humans,

1118
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,890
will seek out mates and
engage in mating behavior

1119
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,190
more frequently during the
long days of spring and summer.

1120
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,860
That's right, in
seasonally-breeding animals,

1121
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,700
of course, this is the case,

1122
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,900
but in humans as well,

1123
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,830
there is more seeking out
of mates and mating behavior

1124
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,890
in longer day times of year.

1125
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,570
Now, you could imagine
at least two mechanisms

1126
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,560
by which this occurs.

1127
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,410
The first mechanism we could
easily map to melatonin

1128
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,040
and the fact that melatonin is suppressive

1129
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,470
to various aspects of the
so-called gonadal axis,

1130
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,050
which is basically a fancy way of saying

1131
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,730
that melatonin inhibits
testosterone and estrogen output

1132
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:40,150
from the testes and from the ovaries.

1133
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,320
I just want to remind people
that both males and females

1134
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,720
make testosterone and estrogen,

1135
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,330
although in different ratios, typically,

1136
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,640
in males versus females,

1137
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,610
and that both testosterone and estrogen

1138
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,610
are critical for the desire to
mate and for mating behavior.

1139
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,609
There's a broad misconception
that testosterone

1140
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:00,320
is involved in mating behavior

1141
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,020
and estrogen's involved
in other behaviors,

1142
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,680
but having enough estrogen is critical

1143
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,960
for both males and females

1144
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,080
in order to maintain the desire to mate,

1145
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,210
and indeed the ability to mate.

1146
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,000
I discuss this on the episode

1147
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,360
on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.

1148
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,980
So if you'd like more details on that,

1149
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,340
please see that episode of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1150
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,880
Okay, so if melatonin is suppressive

1151
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,410
to the so-called gonadal axis
and reduces overall levels

1152
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,030
of testosterone and estrogen
in males and females

1153
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,560
and a light inhibits melatonin,

1154
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,750
then when there's more light,
then there's less melatonin

1155
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,570
and more hormone output from the gonads.

1156
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,730
And indeed that's how the system works,

1157
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,750
but that's not the entire story.

1158
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,120
It turns out that there is a second

1159
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,820
so-called parallel pathway,

1160
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,550
meaning a different biological pathway

1161
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,340
that operates in parallel

1162
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,500
to the light suppression
of melatonin pathway

1163
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,730
that provides a basis for longer days,

1164
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:02,080
inspiring more desire to mate
and more mating behavior.

1165
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,270
So if we think of the first
pathway involving melatonin

1166
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:08,520
as sort of a break on these
reproductive hormones,

1167
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,120
the second mechanism is
more like an accelerator

1168
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,090
on those hormones.

1169
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,110
And yet it still involve light.

1170
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,770
As I'm about to tell you,
in animals such as mice,

1171
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,640
but also in humans,

1172
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,070
exposure to light, in
particular UV blue light,

1173
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,170
so short wavelengths of light,

1174
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,220
can trigger increases in
testosterone and estrogen

1175
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,820
and the desire to mate.

1176
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,670
Now what's especially important
about this accelerator

1177
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,850
on the desire to mate and
mating behavior and hormones

1178
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,950
is that it is driven by exposure to light,

1179
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,770
but it is not the exposure
of light to the eyes.

1180
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,170
It turns out that it is
the exposure of your skin

1181
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,250
to particular wavelengths of light

1182
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,890
that is triggering
increases in the hormones,

1183
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,510
testosterone, and estrogen,

1184
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,060
leading to increased desire to mate.

1185
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,270
As it turns out, your skin,

1186
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,440
which most of us just think of as a way

1187
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,390
to protect the organs of our body

1188
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,340
or something to hang
clothes on or ornaments on,

1189
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,480
if you're somebody who
has earrings and so forth,

1190
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,380
your skin is actually an endocrine organ,

1191
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,220
meaning it is a hormone-producing

1192
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,393
and hormone-influencing organ.

1193
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,700
I promise what I'm about to tell you next

1194
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,560
will forever change the way that you think

1195
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,800
about your skin and light
and the desire to mate,

1196
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,440
and indeed even mating behavior.

1197
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,600
I think the results are best understood

1198
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,030
by simply going through the primary data,

1199
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,400
meaning the actual research on this topic.

1200
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,590
And to do so, I'm going
to review a recent paper

1201
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,000
that was published in
the Journal Cell Reports,

1202
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,120
Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

1203
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,463
This is a paper that came out in 2021,

1204
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,680
entitled "Skin Exposure to UVB light

1205
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,130
induces a skin, brain, gonad
axis, and sexual behavior.

1206
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,810
And I want to emphasize
that this was a paper

1207
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,220
that focused on mice

1208
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,600
in order to address specific mechanisms,

1209
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,650
because in mice,

1210
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:04,280
you can so-called knock
out particular genes.

1211
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,640
You can remove particular
genes to understand mechanism.

1212
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,190
You just can't do that in humans

1213
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,000
in any kind of controlled way,

1214
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,200
at least not at this point in time.

1215
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,420
And this study also explores humans

1216
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,323
and looked at human
subjects, both men and women.

1217
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,430
The basic finding of this study was that

1218
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,330
when mice or humans were exposed to UVB,

1219
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,530
meaning ultraviolet blue light,
so shortwave length light

1220
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,010
of the sort that comes
through in sunshine,

1221
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,323
but is also available through
various artificial sources.

1222
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,590
If they received enough exposure

1223
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,093
of that light to their skin,

1224
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,870
there were increases in
testosterone that were observed

1225
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,030
within a very brief period of time,

1226
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:50,120
also increases in the hormone estrogen.

1227
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,577
And I should point out that
the proper ratios of estrogen

1228
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:55,850
and testosterone were maintained
in both males and females,

1229
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,760
at least as far as these data indicate,

1230
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,760
and mice tended to seek out
mating more and mate more.

1231
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,630
There were also increases
in gonadal weight,

1232
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,300
literally increases in testy
size and in ovarian size

1233
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,080
when mice were exposed to this UVB light

1234
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,540
past a certain threshold.

1235
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,200
Now, as I mentioned before, the
study also looked at humans.

1236
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,980
They did not look at
testy size or ovarian size

1237
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,300
in the human subjects.

1238
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,280
However, because they're humans,

1239
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,000
they did address the psychology
of these human beings

1240
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,470
and addressed whether or
not they had increases

1241
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,840
in, for instance, aggressiveness
or in passionate feelings

1242
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,700
and how their perception
of other people changed

1243
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,360
when they were getting a
lot of UVB light exposure

1244
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,240
to the skin.

1245
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,390
So before I get into some of
the more important details

1246
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,080
of the study and how it was done

1247
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,790
and how you can leverage this
information for yourself,

1248
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,133
if you desire,

1249
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,650
I just want to highlight some
of the basic findings overall.

1250
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,410
UVB exposure increased these
so-called sex steroid levels

1251
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,720
in mice and humans.

1252
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,810
The sex steroid hormones,
when we say steroids,

1253
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,530
we don't mean anabolic
steroids taken exogenously.

1254
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,920
I think when people
hear the word steroids,

1255
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,955
they always think steroid
abuse or use, rather.

1256
00:51:10,955 --> 00:51:13,930
Steroid hormones, such as
testosterone and estrogen,

1257
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:18,002
went up when mice or humans
had a lot of UVB exposure

1258
00:51:18,002 --> 00:51:19,250
to their skin.

1259
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,810
Second of all, UVB light
exposure to the skin

1260
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,660
enhanced female attractiveness,

1261
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,820
so the perceived attractiveness
of females by males,

1262
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,120
and increased the receptiveness

1263
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,390
or the desire to mate in both sexes.

1264
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,680
UVB light exposure also
changed various aspects

1265
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,050
of female biology related to fertility,

1266
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,530
in particular follicle growth.

1267
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:43,800
Follicle and egg maturation

1268
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,310
are well-known indices of fertility,

1269
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,760
and of course, correlate
with the menstrual cycle

1270
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,900
in adult humans and is related overall

1271
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,367
to the propensity to become pregnant.

1272
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,390
UVB light exposure enhanced
maturation of the follicle,

1273
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,580
which just meant that more
healthy eggs were being produced.

1274
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,940
These are impressive effects.

1275
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,900
First of all, they
looked at a large number

1276
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,200
of variables in the study.

1277
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,120
And the fact that they looked

1278
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,190
at mice and humans is terrific.

1279
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:13,100
I think that oftentimes we
find it hard to translate data

1280
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,950
from mice to humans.

1281
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,310
So the fact that they
looked at both in parallel

1282
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:17,193
is wonderful.

1283
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,300
In the mice and in the humans,

1284
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,800
they established a protocol

1285
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,950
that essentially involved
exposing the skin to UV light

1286
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,440
that was equivalent to
about 20 to 30 minutes

1287
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,380
of midday sun exposure.

1288
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,090
Now, of course, where
you live in the world

1289
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,730
will dictate whether
or not that midday sun

1290
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,670
is very, very bright and
intense or is less bright.

1291
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,400
Maybe there's cloud cover, et cetera.

1292
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,130
But since I'm imagining that
most people are interested

1293
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,730
in the ways to increase testosterone

1294
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,750
and/or estrogen in humans

1295
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,870
and are not so much interested

1296
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,100
in increasing testosterone in mice,

1297
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,850
I'm going to just review what they did

1298
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,940
in the human population
or the human subjects.

1299
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,280
What they did is they had people,

1300
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,070
first of all, establish a baseline.

1301
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,360
And the way they established a baseline

1302
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,670
was a little bit unusual,

1303
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,560
but will make perfect sense to you.

1304
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,020
They had people wear long sleeves

1305
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,820
and essentially cover up and
avoid sunlight for a few days

1306
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,750
so they could measure
their baseline hormones

1307
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,378
in the absence of getting
a lot of UVB light exposure

1308
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:16,630
from the sun or from other sources.

1309
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,880
Now, of course, these people had access

1310
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,020
to artificial lights,

1311
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,060
but as I've pointed out
on this podcast before,

1312
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,450
it's pretty unusual that
you'll get enough UVB exposure

1313
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,030
from artificial lights throughout the day.

1314
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,710
And in the morning you
need a lot of UVB exposure,

1315
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,110
or we should be getting a lot
of UVB exposure to our eyes

1316
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,050
and to our face and to our
skin throughout the day,

1317
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,740
provided we're not getting sunburnt.

1318
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,220
This is actually a healthy
thing for mood and for energy

1319
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,220
throughout the day.

1320
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,940
It's only at night,
basically between the hours

1321
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,310
of about 10:00 pm and 4:00 am,

1322
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,740
that even a tiny bit of UVB
exposure from artificial sources

1323
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,667
can mess us up in terms of our sleep

1324
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,460
and our energy levels, and so on.

1325
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,880
And that's because of
the potent effect of UVB

1326
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,080
on suppressing melatonin.

1327
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,220
So the point here is that
they establish a baseline

1328
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,230
whereby people were getting
some artificial light exposure

1329
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,063
throughout the day,

1330
00:54:05,063 --> 00:54:06,690
but they weren't getting outside a lot.

1331
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,380
They weren't getting a lot of sunlight.

1332
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,750
And then they had people receive a dose

1333
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,060
of UVB light exposure

1334
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,860
that was about 20 to 30 minutes outdoors.

1335
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,350
They had people wear short
sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses.

1336
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:21,920
Some people wore sleeveless shirts.

1337
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,610
They encouraged people to wear shorts.

1338
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,010
So they were indeed wearing clothing.

1339
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,400
They were not naked.

1340
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,310
And they were wearing
clothing that was culturally

1341
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,470
and situationally appropriate,

1342
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,980
at least for the part of the world

1343
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,390
where this study was done.

1344
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,150
And they had people do that
two or three times a week.

1345
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,370
So in terms of a protocol

1346
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,890
that you might export from this study,

1347
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,040
basically getting outside
for about 30 minutes,

1348
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,730
two or three times a week
in a minimum of clothing,

1349
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,220
and yet still wearing enough clothing

1350
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,970
that is culturally appropriate.

1351
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,210
They were outside, they
weren't sun bathing,

1352
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:52,620
flipping over on their back and front.

1353
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,870
They were just moving about doing things.

1354
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,440
They could read, they could talk,

1355
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,560
they could go about other activities,

1356
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,590
but they weren't wearing a broad brim hat

1357
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,580
or a hat of any kind,

1358
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,750
just getting a lot of sun
exposure to their skin.

1359
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:08,030
They did this for a total
of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.

1360
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,100
So this took several weeks, right?

1361
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,450
It took about a month,
if you think about it,

1362
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,380
two or three times per week

1363
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:15,810
for a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.

1364
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,330
These treatments, of course,
are just being outside

1365
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,420
in the sun.

1366
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,900
And then they measured hormones,

1367
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,120
and they measured the psychology

1368
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,950
of these male and female adult subjects.

1369
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,110
Let's first look at the
psychological changes

1370
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,980
that these human subjects experienced

1371
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,090
after getting 10 to 12 of
these UVB light exposure

1372
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,410
outdoor and sunlight type treatments.

1373
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,120
They did this by collecting blood samples

1374
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,430
throughout the study,

1375
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,990
and they saw significant increases

1376
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,730
in the hormones, beta-estradiol,

1377
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,270
which is one of the
major forms of estrogen,

1378
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,450
progesterone, another
important steroid hormone,

1379
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,720
and testosterone in both men and women.

1380
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,240
Now, an important point is
that the testosterone increases

1381
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,330
were significantly higher in
men that happened to originate

1382
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:03,030
from countries that had low UV exposure

1383
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,560
compared to individuals from countries

1384
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,970
with high UV exposure.

1385
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,110
Now, this ought to make sense

1386
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,370
if we understand a little bit

1387
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:14,010
about how the skin functions
as an endocrine organ.

1388
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,070
Many of you have probably
heard of vitamin D3,

1389
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,730
which is a vitamin that we all make.

1390
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,210
Many people supplement it as well

1391
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,133
if they need additional vitamin D3.

1392
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,840
We all require sunlight in
order to allow vitamin D3

1393
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,200
to be synthesized and perform
its roles in the body.

1394
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,150
And it turns out that
people who have darker skin

1395
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:39,730
actually need more vitamin D3
and/or more sunlight exposure

1396
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,220
in order to activate that D3 pathway,

1397
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,300
than do people with paler skin.

1398
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,490
And this should make sense to all of you

1399
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,190
given what you now
understand about melanocytes,

1400
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,760
that cell type that we discussed earlier,

1401
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,840
because melanocytes have
pigment within them.

1402
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,670
And if you have darker skin,

1403
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,300
it means that you have more melanocytes

1404
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,580
or that you have melanocytes

1405
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,990
that are more efficient
at creating pigment.

1406
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,010
And as a consequence,

1407
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:06,909
the light that lands on your skin

1408
00:57:06,909 --> 00:57:09,420
will be absorbed by those melanocytes,

1409
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,750
and less of it is able
to impact the D3 pathway.

1410
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,070
Whereas if you have pale skin,

1411
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:16,110
more of the light that lands on your skin

1412
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,200
can trigger the synthesis

1413
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,370
and assist the actions of vitamin D3.

1414
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:24,350
Similarly, in this study, they found

1415
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:25,183
that people who had paler skin

1416
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:28,210
and/or who originated from countries

1417
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:32,300
where they had less UVB light
exposure across the year

1418
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,530
had greater, meaning more
significant, increases

1419
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,970
in testosterone overall

1420
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,640
than did people who
already were getting a lot

1421
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,120
of UVB exposure.

1422
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,850
This led them to explore
so-called seasonal changes

1423
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,440
in testosterone that occurred normally

1424
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,710
in the absence of any
light exposure treatment.

1425
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:52,660
So up until now, I've been
talking about the aspects

1426
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,180
of this study involving
people getting outside

1427
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,010
for about 20 to 30 minutes
per day in sunlight,

1428
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,470
in a minimum of clothing.

1429
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,870
There was an increase
in testosterone observed

1430
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,300
in both men and women.

1431
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,320
The increases in testosterone were greater

1432
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,560
for people that had paler
skin than darker skin.

1433
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,270
So the data I'm about to describe

1434
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,030
also come from this same
paper, but do not involve

1435
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:16,130
20 to 30 minute daily
sun exposure protocols.

1436
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,680
It's simply addressing whether
or not testosterone levels

1437
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,563
change as a function of time of year.

1438
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,860
They measure testosterone
across the 12-month calendar.

1439
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,700
This study was done on subjects living

1440
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,230
in the Northern Hemisphere
for the entire year.

1441
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,540
And so in the months of
January, February, and March,

1442
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,650
of course, the length of days is shortest

1443
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,100
and the length of nights is longest.

1444
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,640
And, of course, in the
spring and summer months,

1445
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,750
June, July, August, September, and so on,

1446
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,780
the days are much longer
and the nights are shorter.

1447
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,603
And what they observed was very obvious.

1448
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,620
They observed that testosterone levels

1449
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,820
were lowest in the winter months

1450
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,420
and were highest in the months

1451
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,280
of June, July, August, and September.

1452
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,080
Now, these are very important data.

1453
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,913
At least to my knowledge,

1454
00:59:03,913 --> 00:59:07,490
these are the first data
systematically exploring the levels

1455
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,000
of sex steroid hormones in humans

1456
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,620
as a function of time of year

1457
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,450
and thereby as a function

1458
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,000
of how much sunlight
exposure they're getting.

1459
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,950
And what's remarkable about these data

1460
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,680
is that they map very
well to the data in mice

1461
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,600
and the other data in
this paper on humans,

1462
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,040
which illustrate that if you're
getting more UVB exposure,

1463
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,810
your testosterone levels are higher.

1464
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,090
This study went a step further

1465
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:33,780
and explored whether or not
the amount of sunlight exposure

1466
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,270
that one is getting to their skin

1467
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,420
influences their psychology

1468
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,130
in terms of whether or not
they have increased desire

1469
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,600
to mate and so on.

1470
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,970
It's well known that sunlight exposure

1471
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,810
to the eyes can increase mood.

1472
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,775
And I talked about this
in the podcast episode

1473
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:50,684
with my guest, Dr. Samer Hattar,

1474
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:52,800
who's the director of
the chronobiology unit

1475
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,430
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health.

1476
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,720
And Samer's recommendation

1477
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,550
is that people get as
much bright light exposure

1478
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:00,230
as they safely can in the
morning and throughout the day

1479
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:02,450
for sake of both sleep and energy,

1480
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:06,900
but also for enhancing mood
and regulating appetite.

1481
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,840
In this study, it was found

1482
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,030
that both males and
females had higher levels

1483
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:16,180
of romantic passion after
getting the UV treatment.

1484
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,760
In fact, some of them reported
increases in romantic passion

1485
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,490
from just one or two
of these UV treatments.

1486
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,580
So they didn't have to go
through all 10 or 12 in order

1487
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:28,430
to get a statistically
significant increase in passion.

1488
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,060
Now, when we talk about passion,

1489
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,030
as the authors of this paper acknowledge,

1490
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,990
there's really two forms.

1491
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:34,690
There is emotional and sexual,

1492
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,440
and they parse this pretty finely.

1493
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,980
I don't want to go into all the details,

1494
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,760
and we can provide a reference
and link to this study

1495
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,760
if you'd like to look at those details.

1496
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,610
But what they found was that women

1497
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,710
receiving this UVB light exposure

1498
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,550
focused more on increases

1499
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,780
in physical arousal and sexual passion,

1500
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,750
whereas the men actually scored higher

1501
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,620
on the cognitive dimensions of passion,

1502
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,260
such as obsessive thoughts
about their partner and so on.

1503
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,680
Regardless, both males and females

1504
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,450
experienced and reported a
increase in sexual passion

1505
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,920
and desire to mate.

1506
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,660
And we now know there were increases

1507
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,520
in testosterone and estrogen,

1508
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,230
which of course could be driving
the psychological changes,

1509
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,860
although I'm sure that those
interact in both directions,

1510
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,430
meaning the hormones no
doubt affect psychology

1511
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,240
and no doubt the psychology,

1512
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,990
these changes in passionate feelings,

1513
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,910
no doubt also increased

1514
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,950
or changed the hormone levels as well.

1515
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,410
And I want to reemphasize

1516
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,430
that there was a component of the study

1517
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,320
that had no deliberate
daylight, sunlight exposure

1518
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,380
for 20 or 30 minutes,

1519
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,630
but rather just looked at hormone
levels throughout the year

1520
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:44,020
and found that the increase in day length

1521
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,460
correlated with increases

1522
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,450
in testosterone and sexual passion.

1523
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,180
Now, in my opinion, this
is a very noteworthy study

1524
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,360
because it really illustrates
that sunlight and day length

1525
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,430
can impact the melatonin pathway

1526
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:59,640
and thereby take the foot off the brake,

1527
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,617
so to speak, on testosterone, estrogen,

1528
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:04,010
and the desire to mate.

1529
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:08,250
It also emphasizes that
sunlight, UVB light,

1530
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,400
can directly trigger hormone pathways

1531
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,130
and desire to mate and mating behavior.

1532
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,530
Now, this study went a step further

1533
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,540
in defining the precise mechanism

1534
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,537
by which light can
impact all these hormones

1535
01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:21,600
and this desire to mate.

1536
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,700
And here, understanding
the mechanism is key

1537
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,170
if you want to export
a particular protocol

1538
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,853
or tool that you might apply.

1539
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:32,470
We talked earlier about how
UVB light exposure to the eyes

1540
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:34,610
triggers activation of
these particular neurons

1541
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,670
within the eye,

1542
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,940
and then with centers deeper in the brain,

1543
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,820
and eventually the pineal gland

1544
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,200
to suppress the output of melatonin

1545
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,070
and thereby to allow
testosterone and estrogen

1546
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:46,230
to exist at higher levels

1547
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,620
because melatonin can inhibit
testosterone and estrogen.

1548
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:51,700
In this study,

1549
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,140
they were able to very clearly establish

1550
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,490
that it is sunlight exposure to our skin

1551
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,470
that is causing these hormone increases

1552
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:02,150
that they observed in mice and humans.

1553
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,610
And the way they did that

1554
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:06,690
was to use the so-called
knockout technology,

1555
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,730
the ability to remove specific genes

1556
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,110
within specific tissues of the body.

1557
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,650
And what they found is that UVB light,

1558
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,483
meaning sunlight-exposed skin,

1559
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,530
upregulated, meaning
increased the activity

1560
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,030
of something called p53,

1561
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,060
which is involved in
the maturation of cells

1562
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,030
and various aspects of cellular function.

1563
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:29,890
And the cells they were focused
on were the keratinocytes,

1564
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,560
which you are now familiar with
from our earlier discussion

1565
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,140
about the fact that the
epidermis of your skin

1566
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,013
contains mainly keratinocytes
and melanocytes.

1567
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:43,060
Sunlight exposure increased
p53 activity in the skin.

1568
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:48,060
And p53 activity was required
for the downstream increases

1569
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,030
in ovarian size, in testicular size,

1570
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:55,580
in testosterone increases,
in the estrogen increases,

1571
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,310
and the various other changes

1572
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,020
that they observed at
the physiological level

1573
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,110
when animals or humans
were exposed to sunlight.

1574
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:04,960
So these data are important
because what they mean

1575
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,950
is that not only is it important

1576
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,870
that we get sunlight
exposure early in the day

1577
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,690
and throughout the day to our eyes,

1578
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:14,050
at least as much as is safely possible,

1579
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,750
but that we also need to
get UVB sunlight exposure

1580
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:21,070
onto our skin if we want to
activate this p53 pathway

1581
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:25,690
in keratinocytes and the
testosterone and estrogen increases

1582
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:28,430
that are downstream of that p53 pathway.

1583
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:33,270
So even though the gene knockout
studies were done on mice,

1584
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,630
they clearly show that if
you remove p53 from the skin,

1585
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:39,240
that these effects simply do not occur.

1586
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,640
So in terms of thinking about a protocol

1587
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,560
to increase testosterone and estrogen,

1588
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,900
mood and feelings of passion,

1589
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,800
the idea is that you would want

1590
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,600
to get these two to
three exposures per week,

1591
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,510
minimum of 20 to 30 minutes
of sunlight exposure

1592
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,490
onto as much of your body

1593
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,840
as you can reasonably expose it to.

1594
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,080
And when I say reasonably, I mean,

1595
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,410
of course you have to
obey cultural constraints,

1596
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,710
decency constraints.

1597
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,690
And of course you have
to also obey the fact

1598
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:10,660
that sunlight can burn your skin.

1599
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,967
So many people are probably going to ask,

1600
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:15,250
"What happens if you wear sunscreen?"

1601
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,730
Well, in theory, because
sunscreen has UV protection,

1602
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,880
it would block some of these effects.

1603
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,713
Now I'm not suggesting

1604
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:24,620
that people do away
with sunscreen entirely.

1605
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,810
I do hope to do an episode all
about sunscreen in the future

1606
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:31,000
because sunscreen is a bit
of a controversial topic.

1607
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,760
Skin cancers are a real thing,

1608
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,660
and many people are especially
prone to skin cancer,

1609
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,570
so you need to take that seriously.

1610
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:39,840
Some people are not very
prone to skin cancers

1611
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,660
and can tolerate much more sun exposure.

1612
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,510
You're probably familiar
with the simple fact

1613
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:47,930
that if you've gone outside
on the beach with friends,

1614
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,990
some people get burned
very easily, others don't.

1615
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,470
So you really should prioritize the health

1616
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,880
and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin.

1617
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,780
However, these data and
other data point to the fact

1618
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,540
that we should all probably be striving

1619
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,210
to get more sunlight
exposure onto our skin

1620
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,710
during the winter months

1621
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,970
and still getting sunlight
exposure onto our skin

1622
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,050
in the summer months,

1623
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,800
provided we can do that
without damaging our skin.

1624
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,690
Another set of very impressive
effects of UVB light,

1625
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:16,780
whether or not it comes from sunlight

1626
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,950
or from an artificial source,

1627
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:22,440
is the effect of UVB light
on our tolerance for pain.

1628
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,350
It turns out that our tolerance for pain

1629
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,190
varies across the year

1630
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,390
and that our pain tolerance is increased

1631
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:32,160
in longer day conditions.

1632
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,850
And as we saw with the effects of UVB

1633
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:36,683
on hormones and mating,

1634
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,237
again, this is occurring
via UVB exposure to the skin

1635
01:06:42,237 --> 01:06:45,160
and UVB exposure to the eyes.

1636
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,750
I want to just describe two studies

1637
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,520
that really capture the
essence of these results.

1638
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,540
I'm going to discuss these in
kind of a top contour fashion.

1639
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,260
I won't go into it as quite as much depth

1640
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,460
as I did the last study,

1641
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,960
but I will provide links
to these studies as well.

1642
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,910
The first study is entitled

1643
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,600
Skin Exposure to Ultraviolet
B Rapidly Activates

1644
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,570
Systemic, Neuroendocrine, and
Immunosuppressive Responses.

1645
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:08,403
And you might hear that and think,

1646
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:09,900
"Oh, immunosuppressive that's bad."

1647
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,890
But basically what they observed
is that even one exposure

1648
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,490
to UVB light changed the
output of particular hormones

1649
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,100
and neurochemicals in the body,

1650
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,670
such as corticotropin
hormone and beta-endorphins,

1651
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,750
which are these endogenous opioids.

1652
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,330
We've all heard of the opioid crisis,

1653
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,500
which is people getting
addicted to opioids

1654
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,830
that they are taking in
drug form, pharmaceuticals.

1655
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,090
But here I'm referring to endorphins

1656
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,570
that our body naturally
manufactures and releases

1657
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,110
in order to counter pain

1658
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:44,110
and act as somewhat of a
psychological soother also,

1659
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,410
because, of course, physical
pain and emotional pain

1660
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,740
are intimately linked
in the brain and body.

1661
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:51,980
What they found was that
exposure to UVB light

1662
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:55,080
increased the release of
these beta-endorphins.

1663
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,640
It caused essentially the release

1664
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,410
of an endogenous pain killer.

1665
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,040
Now, a second study that
came out very recently,

1666
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,810
just this last week, in fact,

1667
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,070
published in the journal Neuron,

1668
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:08,290
Cell Press journal, excellent journal,

1669
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,290
is entitled A Visual Circuit Related

1670
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,420
to the Periaqueductal Gray Area

1671
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,330
for the Antinociceptive Effects
of Bright Light Treatment.

1672
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:18,010
I'll translate a little
bit of that for you.

1673
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:21,649
The periaqueductal gray is
a region of the mid-brain

1674
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:24,179
that contains a lot of neurons

1675
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:26,890
that can release endogenous opioids,

1676
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:30,850
things like beta-enkephalin,
things like enkephalin,

1677
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,250
things like mu opioid.

1678
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,359
These are all names of chemicals

1679
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:35,669
that your body can manufacture

1680
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,649
that act as endogenous pain killers

1681
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:39,519
and increase your tolerance for pain.

1682
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,930
They actually make you
feel less pain overall

1683
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,779
by shutting down some of the neurons

1684
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:47,149
that perceive pain or by
reducing their activity.

1685
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:48,689
Not to a dangerous level, right?

1686
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,169
They're not going to
block the pain response

1687
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,660
so that you burn yourself unnecessarily

1688
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,200
or harm yourself unnecessarily,

1689
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,563
but they act a bit of a
pain killer from the inside.

1690
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,310
If you heard the word antinociceptive,

1691
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:06,310
nociception is basically
the perception or the way

1692
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:09,460
in which neurons respond
to painful stimuli.

1693
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,729
So you can think of nociceptive events

1694
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:14,089
in your nervous system as painful events.

1695
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,760
And there I'm using a broad brush.

1696
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,557
I realized that the
experts in pain will say,

1697
01:09:17,557 --> 01:09:19,550
"Oh, it's not really a pain circuit,"

1698
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:20,500
et cetera, et cetera.

1699
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,890
But for sake of today's discussion,

1700
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:26,520
it's fair to say that nociception
is the perception of pain.

1701
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,550
So if this title is A
Visual Circuit Related

1702
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,359
to the Periaqueductal Gray,

1703
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,239
which is this area that releases
these endogenous opioids

1704
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,870
for the antinociceptive,
the anti-pain effects

1705
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,383
of bright light treatment,

1706
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,569
the key finding of this study

1707
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:46,569
is that it is light landing
on the eyes and captured

1708
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:49,019
by the specific cells I
was talking about earlier,

1709
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,827
those intrinsically photosensitive
melanopsin ganglion cells

1710
01:09:51,827 --> 01:09:53,100
is the long name for them,

1711
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,950
but these particular neurons in your eye,

1712
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:57,320
and in my eye incidentally,

1713
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,640
that communicate with
particular brain areas.

1714
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,750
These brain areas have names.

1715
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,090
If you want to know
them, for you aficionados

1716
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:05,760
or for you ultra curious folks,

1717
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,150
they have names like the ventral
lateral geniculate nucleus

1718
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,620
and the intergeniculate leaflet.

1719
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,820
The names don't matter.

1720
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,430
The point is that light
landing on the eyes

1721
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:16,740
is captured by these melanopsin cells.

1722
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,040
They absorb that light,

1723
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,250
translate that light
into electrical signals

1724
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,040
that are handed off to areas of the brain,

1725
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,490
such as the ventral geniculate.

1726
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:27,690
And then the ventral
geniculate communicates

1727
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,320
with this periaqueductal gray area

1728
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,000
to evoke the release of
these endogenous opioids

1729
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,020
that soothe you and lead
to less perception of pain.

1730
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,410
This is a really important study

1731
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:43,390
because it's long been
known that in longer days

1732
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,670
or in bright light environments,

1733
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:47,403
we tolerate emotional
and physical pain better.

1734
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,030
Previous studies had shown

1735
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:53,030
that it is light landing on our skin

1736
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:55,500
that mediates that
effect, but only in part.

1737
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,440
It couldn't explain the entire effect.

1738
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,420
This very recent study indicates

1739
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,390
that it's also light arriving at the eyes,

1740
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,200
and in this case, again, UVB
light, ultraviolet blue light

1741
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,283
of the sort that comes from sunlight,

1742
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,020
that is triggering these anti-pain

1743
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,740
or pain-relieving pathways.

1744
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:15,230
So once again, we have
two parallel pathways.

1745
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,360
This is a theme you're going to hear

1746
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,080
over and over and over again,
not just in this episode,

1747
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,510
but in all episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1748
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,810
because this is the way that
your brain and body are built.

1749
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,960
Nature rarely relies on one mechanism

1750
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,230
in order to create an
important phenomenon,

1751
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,460
and pain relief is an
important phenomenon.

1752
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,950
So we now have at least two
examples of the potent effects

1753
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:39,610
of UVB light exposure to
the skin and to the eyes.

1754
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:44,008
One involving activation of testosterone

1755
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,380
and estrogen pathways,
as it relates to mating,

1756
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,250
and another that relates to
reducing the total amount

1757
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,660
of pain that we experience

1758
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,240
in response to any painful stimuli.

1759
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,190
So for those of you that are
thinking tools and protocols,

1760
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:00,170
if you're somebody who's
experiencing chronic pain,

1761
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,800
provided you can do it safely,

1762
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,220
try to get some UVB exposure,
ideally from sunlight.

1763
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,960
I think the 20 to 30-minute protocol,

1764
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,570
two or three times per
week is an excellent one,

1765
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:14,320
seems like a fairly low
dose of UVB light exposure.

1766
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,380
It's hard to imagine getting
much damage to the skin.

1767
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,780
Of course, if you have
very sensitive skin,

1768
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,070
or if you live in an area of the world

1769
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,347
that is very, very bright

1770
01:12:23,347 --> 01:12:26,420
and has intense sunlight at
particular times of year,

1771
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,870
you'll want to be cautious.

1772
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:30,490
Heed the warnings and
considerations about sunscreen

1773
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:32,920
that I talked about earlier,
or about wearing a hat.

1774
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,900
But the point is very clear.

1775
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,300
Most of us should be
getting more UVB exposure

1776
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,163
from sunlight.

1777
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,580
I can already hear the
screams within the comments

1778
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,577
or rather the questions
within the comments, saying,

1779
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:46,260
"Well, what if I live
in a part of the world

1780
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,790
where I don't get much UVB exposure?"

1781
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,989
And I want to emphasize something
that I've also emphasized

1782
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:53,160
in the many discussions on this podcast

1783
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,500
related to sleep and circadian
rhythms and alertness,

1784
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:59,410
which is even on a cloud-covered day,

1785
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:03,190
you are going to get far
more light energy, photons

1786
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:06,670
through cloud cover than
you are going to get

1787
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,180
from an indoor light source,
an artificial light source.

1788
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,730
I can't emphasize this enough.

1789
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,090
If you look outside in the morning

1790
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,130
and you see some sunlight,

1791
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,780
if you see some sunlight
throughout the day,

1792
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:20,410
you would do yourself a great favor

1793
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,140
to try and chase some of that sunlight

1794
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,130
and get into that sunlight
to expose your eyes

1795
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,170
and your skin to that sunlight
as much as you safely can.

1796
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,610
And when I say as much as you safely can,

1797
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,940
never ever look at any light,

1798
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,670
artificial, sunlight, or otherwise,

1799
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:35,340
that's so bright that
it's painful to look at.

1800
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,730
It's fine to get that light

1801
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,860
arriving on your eyes indirectly.

1802
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,380
It's fine to wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses.

1803
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,640
In fact, if you think about
the biology of the eye

1804
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,130
and the way that those lenses work,

1805
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,520
that you will just serve
to focus that light

1806
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,296
onto the very cells that
you want those light beams

1807
01:13:50,296 --> 01:13:51,950
to be delivered to,

1808
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:54,220
whereas sunglasses that
are highly reflective

1809
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,050
or trying to get your sunlight exposure

1810
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,010
through a windshield of a car

1811
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,980
or through a window simply won't work.

1812
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,100
I'm sorry to tell you,

1813
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:06,250
but most windows are designed
to filter out the UVB light.

1814
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,050
And if you're somebody who's
really keen on blue blockers

1815
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,040
and you're wearing your
blue blockers all day,

1816
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,060
well, don't wear them outside.

1817
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,950
And in fact, you're probably
doing yourself a disservice

1818
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:18,310
by wearing them in the
morning and in the daytime.

1819
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:20,140
There certainly is a
place for blue blockers

1820
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:21,350
in the evening and nighttime,

1821
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:24,170
if you're having issues with
falling and staying asleep.

1822
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:26,070
But if you think about it, blue blockers,

1823
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,903
what they're really doing

1824
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:30,920
is blocking those short wavelength,
UVB wavelengths of light

1825
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,860
that you so desperately need
to arrive at your retina

1826
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,990
and of course, also onto your skin

1827
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:38,660
in order to get these
powerful biological effects

1828
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,733
on hormones and on pain reduction.

1829
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,370
And in terms of skin exposure,

1830
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:46,590
these data also might make
you think a little bit

1831
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:48,160
about whether or not you
should wear short sleeves

1832
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:48,993
or long sleeves,

1833
01:14:48,993 --> 01:14:51,830
whether or not you want to wear
shorts or a skirt or pants.

1834
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,960
It's all going to depend
on the context of your life

1835
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,320
and the social and other variables

1836
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,850
that are important, of course.

1837
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,590
I don't know each and every
one of your circumstances,

1838
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:05,480
so I can't tell you to do
X or Y or Z, nor would I,

1839
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,220
but you might take into consideration

1840
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:10,330
that it is the total
amount of skin exposure

1841
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:14,210
that is going to allow you to
capture more or fewer photons,

1842
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,230
depending on, for instance,

1843
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,030
if you're completely cloaked in clothing

1844
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:21,460
and you're just exposed in
the hands, neck, and face

1845
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,640
such as I am now,

1846
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,150
or whether or not you're
outside in shorts and a T-shirt,

1847
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,360
you're going to get very,
very different patterns

1848
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,840
of biological signaling activation

1849
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,190
in those two circumstances.

1850
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:33,930
Many of you I'm guessing are wondering

1851
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:37,170
whether or not you should
seek out UVB exposure

1852
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,660
throughout the entire year
or only in the summer months.

1853
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,680
And that's sort of going to depend

1854
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,260
on whether or not you
experience depression

1855
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:46,530
in the winter months,

1856
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,920
so called seasonal effective disorder.

1857
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,190
Some people have mild, some
people have severe forms

1858
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,310
of seasonal effective disorder.

1859
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:55,190
Some people love the fall and
winter and the shorter days.

1860
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,920
They love bundling up.
They love the leaves.

1861
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,210
They love the snow, they love the cold,

1862
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,170
and they don't experience
those psychological lows.

1863
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,960
So it varies tremendously.

1864
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,840
And there are genetic differences

1865
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,830
and birthplace origin differences
that relate to all this,

1866
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:11,453
but really it has to be considered
on a case-by-case basis.

1867
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,840
I personally believe,
and this was reinforced

1868
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,080
by the director of the chronobiology unit

1869
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,620
at the National Institutes of
Mental Health, Samer Hattar,

1870
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:25,120
that we would all do well
to get more UVB exposure

1871
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,770
from sunlight throughout the entire year,

1872
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,260
provided we aren't burning our skin

1873
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,423
or damaging our eyes in some way.

1874
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:34,800
In addition to that,
during the winter months,

1875
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,060
if you do experience some drop in energy

1876
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:43,030
or increase in depression
or psychological lows,

1877
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:47,500
it can be very beneficial
to access a SAD lamp.

1878
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,350
Or if you don't want to buy a SAD lamp,

1879
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,270
'cause oftentimes they
can be very expensive,

1880
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:55,120
you might do well to simply
get a LED lighting panel.

1881
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,490
I've described one before.

1882
01:16:56,490 --> 01:17:00,170
And I want to emphasize that I
have no affiliation whatsoever

1883
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:01,870
to these commercial sources,

1884
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,720
but I've described one before
and I'll describe it again.

1885
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,160
And we can provide a link to
a couple examples of these

1886
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,450
in the show, in the show
note captions, excuse me.

1887
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:14,450
This is a 930 to 1,000
lux, L-U-X, light source

1888
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,400
that's designed for drawing.

1889
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,740
It's literally a drawing box.

1890
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:20,510
It's a thin panel. It's
about the size of a laptop.

1891
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,730
Very inexpensive compared
to the typical SAD lamp.

1892
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:23,563
I actually have one,

1893
01:17:23,563 --> 01:17:25,550
and I position it on my desk all day long.

1894
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,780
I also happen to have
skylights above my desk.

1895
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,910
I'm fairly sensitive to
the effects of light.

1896
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:31,290
So in longer days I feel much better

1897
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,230
than I do in shorter days.

1898
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,150
I've never suffered

1899
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:35,180
from full-blown seasonal
effective disorder,

1900
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:38,730
but I keep that light
source on throughout the day

1901
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:39,690
throughout the year.

1902
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:42,110
But I also make it a point to
get outside and get sunlight

1903
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:44,550
early in the morning and several
times throughout the day.

1904
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:47,270
And if it's particularly overcast outside

1905
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,670
or there just doesn't seem
to be a lot of sunlight

1906
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:50,960
coming through those clouds,

1907
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,540
I will try to look at that light source

1908
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,880
a little bit more each day

1909
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,420
in order to trigger these mechanisms.

1910
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,160
Now, some people may
desire to get UVB exposure

1911
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,160
to their skin and they want to do that

1912
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,920
through sources other than sunlight.

1913
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,150
And there it's a little
bit more complicated.

1914
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:08,330
There are, of course, tanning salons,

1915
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:10,700
which basically are beds of UVB light.

1916
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,160
That's really all they are.

1917
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,130
I've never been to one.

1918
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,630
I know people do frequent them

1919
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:16,130
in certain parts of the world.

1920
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:19,320
There, of course, people
are covering their eyes.

1921
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,780
They are only getting UVB
exposure to their skin, typically

1922
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,920
because the UVB exposure,
or intensities rather,

1923
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,560
tend to be very, very high.

1924
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,920
And so you can actually damage your eyes.

1925
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,940
If you're looking at a very, very bright

1926
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,530
artificial UVB source up close.

1927
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:35,190
So you really have to explore
these options for yourself.

1928
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:37,150
Sunlight of course, being the original

1929
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:40,780
and still the best way
to get UVB exposure.

1930
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:44,510
So without knowing your particular
circumstances, finances,

1931
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,390
genetics, or place of origin, et cetera,

1932
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,590
I can't know whether or not

1933
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,890
you need to use artificial sources.

1934
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,650
You're going to have to gauge that.

1935
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:55,250
Meanwhile, getting outside, looking at

1936
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:59,330
and getting some exposure
of UVB onto your skin

1937
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:00,550
is going to be beneficial

1938
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:03,380
for the vast majority of people out there.

1939
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,530
And in fact, it's even
going to be beneficial

1940
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,123
for people that are blind.

1941
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,770
People that are blind,
provided they still have eyes,

1942
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:14,230
often maintain these melanopsin cells.

1943
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:16,240
So even if you're low vision or no vision,

1944
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,110
getting UVB exposure to your eyes

1945
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:21,060
can be very beneficial for sake of mood,

1946
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,400
hormone pathways, pain
reduction, and so forth.

1947
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,820
A cautionary note, people who
have retinitis pigmentosa,

1948
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,390
macular degeneration, or glaucoma,

1949
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:34,730
as well as people who are
especially prone to skin cancers

1950
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,660
should definitely consult
with your ophthalmologist

1951
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,130
and dermatologist before
you start increasing

1952
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,970
the total amount of UVB exposure

1953
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,990
that you're getting from any
source, sunlight or otherwise.

1954
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,780
There are additional, very
interesting and powerful effects

1955
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:52,483
of UVB light, in particular
on immune function.

1956
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,330
All the organs of our
body are inside our skin.

1957
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:00,500
And so information about
external conditions,

1958
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,250
meaning the environment that we're in,

1959
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:06,410
need to be communicated to the
various organs of our body.

1960
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,700
Some of them have more direct access

1961
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,630
to what's going on outside.

1962
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:13,830
So for instance, the cells in your brain

1963
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,640
that reside right over
the roof of your mouth,

1964
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,468
your hypothalamus, they
control hormone output,

1965
01:20:17,468 --> 01:20:20,600
and they control the biological functions

1966
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,980
that we call circadian functions,

1967
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:24,470
the ones that change every 24 hours.

1968
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:27,100
Well, those are just
one or two connections,

1969
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,800
meaning synapses away from
those cells in your eye

1970
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,563
that perceive UB, UVB light, excuse me.

1971
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,010
Other organs of your
body, such as your spleen,

1972
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:38,920
which is involved in the
creation of molecules

1973
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,260
and cells that combat infection,

1974
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,990
well, those are a long ways away

1975
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:43,823
from those cell in your eye.

1976
01:20:43,823 --> 01:20:47,280
And in fact, they're a long
ways away from your skin.

1977
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,940
There are beautiful studies showing

1978
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:53,260
that if we get more UVB
exposure from sunlight

1979
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,993
or from appropriate artificial sources,

1980
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,830
that spleen and immune
function are enhanced,

1981
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:03,160
and there's a very logical,

1982
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,070
well-established circuit
as to how that happens.

1983
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,350
Your brain actually
connects to your spleen.

1984
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:12,047
Now, it's not the case
that you can simply think,

1985
01:21:12,047 --> 01:21:14,720
"Okay, spleen, turn on,
release killer cells,

1986
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,410
go out and combat infection."

1987
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:20,730
However, UVB light arriving on the eyes

1988
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:23,560
is known to trigger
activation of the neurons

1989
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,070
within the so-called
sympathetic nervous system.

1990
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:28,400
These neurons are part of the larger thing

1991
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,140
that we call the autonomic nervous system,

1992
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,210
meaning it's below or not
accessible by conscious control.

1993
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,590
It's the thing that
controls your heartbeat,

1994
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,060
controls your breathing
and that also activates

1995
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,040
or flips on the switch
of your immune system.

1996
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,600
When we get a lot of
UVB light in our eyes,

1997
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,900
or I should say sufficient
UVB light in our eyes,

1998
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,150
a particular channel, a
particular set of connections

1999
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:53,260
within the sympathetic
nervous system is activated,

2000
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:57,380
and our spleen deploys
immune cells and molecules

2001
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:00,330
that scavenge for and combat infection.

2002
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,900
So if you've noticed that
you get fewer colds and flus

2003
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,830
and other forms of illness
in the summer months,

2004
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:10,470
part of that could be because
of the increase in temperature

2005
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:11,303
in your environment,

2006
01:22:11,303 --> 01:22:13,310
because typically longer
days are associated

2007
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:15,660
with more warmth in your environment

2008
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,850
as opposed to winter days,

2009
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,590
which are short when it
tends to be colder out.

2010
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:24,000
Well, that's true, but it's also the case

2011
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,480
that people around you
have fewer colds and flus

2012
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,680
and that you will get infected
with fewer colds and flus

2013
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,520
and other infections,
because if those infections,

2014
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,940
whether or not they're bacterial or viral,

2015
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:39,430
arrive in your body,
right, if you inhale them

2016
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:42,000
or they get into your
mouth or on your skin,

2017
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,550
your spleen meets those
infections with a greater output.

2018
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:47,580
In other words, the soldiers
of your immune system,

2019
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,240
the chemicals and cell
types of your immune system

2020
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,150
that combat infection

2021
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:56,490
are in a more ready,
deployed stance, if you will.

2022
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,210
If you want to know more
about the immune system

2023
01:22:58,210 --> 01:22:59,070
and immune function,

2024
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:01,470
I did an entire episode
about the immune system

2025
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:04,850
and the brain, you can find
that at hubermanlab.com.

2026
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:05,950
We talk about cytokines,

2027
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:08,060
we talk about killer cells,
B cells, T cells, et cetera,

2028
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:09,540
a lot of detail there.

2029
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,760
So we often think about the summer months

2030
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,350
and the spring months as fewer
infections floating around.

2031
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:18,890
But in fact, there aren't fewer
infections floating around.

2032
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:21,500
We are simply better at
combating those infections,

2033
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,130
and therefore there's less
infection floating around.

2034
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,670
So we are still confronted
with a lot of infections.

2035
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,960
We're just able to combat them better.

2036
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,410
What does this mean in terms of a tool?

2037
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:33,880
What it means is that
during the winter months,

2038
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,610
we should be especially
conscious of accessing UVB light

2039
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:41,350
to enhance our spleen function,

2040
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,750
to make sure that our
sympathetic nervous system

2041
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,210
is activated to a sufficient level

2042
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:49,550
to keep our immune system
deploying all those killer T cells

2043
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,130
and B cells and cytokines

2044
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,890
so that when we encounter the infections,

2045
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,800
as we inevitably will, right,

2046
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,780
we're constantly being bombarded
with potential infections,

2047
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:00,280
that we can combat those infections well.

2048
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,020
And as just a brief aside,

2049
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,650
but I should mention, a brief aside

2050
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:07,290
that's related to tens of
thousands of quality studies,

2051
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:10,580
it is well known that
wound healing is faster

2052
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:13,940
when we are getting
sufficient UVB exposure.

2053
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,360
Typically, that's associated
with the longer days

2054
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,740
of spring and summer.

2055
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:21,430
It is known that turnover of hair cells,

2056
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:23,610
the very cells that
give rise to hair cells

2057
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:24,443
are called stem cells.

2058
01:24:24,443 --> 01:24:27,080
They live in little
so-called niches in our skin

2059
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,510
with these hair stem cells,

2060
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:31,040
and your hair grows faster in longer days.

2061
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,490
That too is triggered by UVB exposure,

2062
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:37,560
not just to the skin, but to the eyes.

2063
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,480
That's right.

2064
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,670
There was a study published

2065
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:42,310
in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences

2066
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:46,260
a couple of years ago that
showed that the exposure

2067
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,590
of those melanopsin
ganglion cells in your eyes

2068
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:52,230
is absolutely critical for
triggering the turnover

2069
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:56,380
of stem cells in both the skin and hair,

2070
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,690
and also turns out in nails.

2071
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:00,810
So if you've noticed that your skin,

2072
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,630
your hair and your nails look
better and turn over more,

2073
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:06,610
meaning grow faster in longer days,

2074
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,100
that is not on a coincidence.

2075
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,830
That is not just your perception.

2076
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:13,550
In fact, hair grows more,
skin turns over more,

2077
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:14,920
meaning it's going to look more youthful.

2078
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,007
You're going to essentially
remove older skin cells

2079
01:25:18,007 --> 01:25:20,360
and replace them with new cells,

2080
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,700
and all the renewing cells
and tissues of our body

2081
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,820
are going to proliferate,

2082
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,450
are going to recreate themselves more

2083
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:30,290
when we're getting sufficient
UVB light to our eyes

2084
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,010
and also to our skin.

2085
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:36,230
And so while some of you
may think of light therapies

2086
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:38,600
such as red light
therapies or UVB therapies

2087
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,050
as kind of new agey, or just biohacking,

2088
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:42,950
again, a phrase I don't particularly like,

2089
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:44,250
this notion of biohacking,

2090
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:47,470
'cause it implies using
one thing for a purpose

2091
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,743
that it was never tended to have,

2092
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,300
well, it turns out that
UVB exposure and red light,

2093
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,550
as we'll soon see, is a very potent form

2094
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:00,190
of increasing things like
wound healing and skin health

2095
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:04,710
for very logical
mechanistically backed reasons.

2096
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:07,520
So while I can't account for everything

2097
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,670
that's being promoted out there

2098
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,900
in terms of this light source

2099
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,310
will help your skin look more youthful

2100
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:13,463
or will help heal your scars,

2101
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,610
the mechanistic basis for
light having those effects

2102
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:19,190
makes total sense.

2103
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:21,290
But what you should consider, however,

2104
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,750
is that if the particular light therapy

2105
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:27,620
that you're considering
involves very local application

2106
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:32,610
rather than illuminating
broad swaths of skin,

2107
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:35,050
and if it has no
involvement with the eyes,

2108
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:38,900
meaning there's no delivery
of UVB or red light

2109
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,440
or the other light therapy to the eyes,

2110
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,980
it's probably not going to
be as potent a treatment

2111
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,160
as would a more systemic activation

2112
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,130
of larger areas of skin and the eyes.

2113
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:52,850
Now, again, a cautionary note,

2114
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,090
I don't want people taking
technologies that were designed

2115
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:58,300
for local application and
beaming those into the eyes.

2116
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,500
That could be very, very bad

2117
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,550
and damaging to your
retinal and other tissues.

2118
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,220
Certainly, wouldn't want
you taking bright light

2119
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,480
of very high intensity of any kind

2120
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,600
and getting cavalier about that.

2121
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,970
Typically, the local
illumination of say a wound

2122
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,410
or a particular patch of acne

2123
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:17,050
or some other form of skin treatment

2124
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,870
involves very high intensity light.

2125
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:20,470
And if the intensity is too high,

2126
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:22,410
you can actually damage that skin.

2127
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:24,910
And so as we'll talk
about in a few moments,

2128
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:27,410
most of those therapies for modifying skin

2129
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:31,640
involve actually burning
off a small, very thin layer

2130
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,510
at the top of the epidermis

2131
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:35,670
in efforts to trigger the renewal

2132
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:37,050
or the activation of stem cells

2133
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:39,890
that will replenish that with new cells.

2134
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:44,370
So there's a fine line to be
had between light therapies

2135
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,010
that are very localized and intense,

2136
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,190
which are designed to damage skin

2137
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:52,540
and cause reactivation of new stem cells,

2138
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,780
whether that's hair cells
or skin cells, et cetera,

2139
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:57,597
versus systemic activation
across broad swaths of skin

2140
01:27:57,597 --> 01:27:58,430
and the eyes.

2141
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,910
You really have to consider
this on a case-by-case basis,

2142
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:03,740
but at least for now just consider

2143
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:08,240
that increases in
hormones, reduction in pain

2144
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,680
by way of increases in enkephalin

2145
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,720
and other endogenous opioids,

2146
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,720
improving immune status
by activating the spleen,

2147
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,410
and so on, and so on

2148
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:19,580
really are all the downstream consequence

2149
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,950
of illuminating large swaths of skin

2150
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,980
and making sure that those
neurons within the eye

2151
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:26,280
get their adequate UVB exposure

2152
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,270
or other light wavelength exposure,

2153
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:31,380
not simply beaming a
particular wavelength of light

2154
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,010
at a particular location on the body

2155
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:35,410
and hoping that that
particular illumination

2156
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:37,150
at a particular location on the body

2157
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:40,500
is going to somehow change
the biology at that location.

2158
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,350
Our biology just really
doesn't work that way.

2159
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:45,270
It's possible, but in general,

2160
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:48,450
systemic effects through
broad scale illumination

2161
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:49,730
and illumination to the eye,

2162
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:52,320
combined with local
treatments are very likely

2163
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,400
to be the ones that have the most success.

2164
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,730
Now, I'd like to shift our attention

2165
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:58,030
to the effects of light
on mood more specifically.

2166
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:58,863
We talked about this

2167
01:28:58,863 --> 01:29:00,720
in terms of seasonal effective disorder,

2168
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,890
but many of us don't suffer

2169
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:03,410
from seasonal effective disorder.

2170
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,880
So I'd like to drill a little deeper

2171
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,670
into how light impacts mood.

2172
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:11,790
And here, I want to, again,
paraphrase the statements

2173
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:14,500
of Dr. Samer Hattar

2174
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,810
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

2175
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,960
I should mention the director
of the chronobiology unit

2176
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,700
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health

2177
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,700
and perhaps one of the top one
to two to three world experts

2178
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,230
in how light can impact mood, appetite,

2179
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,830
circadian rhythms, and so forth.

2180
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:33,070
Samer stated on the podcast,

2181
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:36,240
and he said in various
other venues as well,

2182
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:40,600
that getting as much UVB light
in our eyes and on our skin

2183
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,410
in the early day and throughout the day

2184
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:45,530
as is safely possible is going
to be beneficial for mood.

2185
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:48,140
There's also another time of day,

2186
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,850
or rather I should say a time of night

2187
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:54,450
in which UVB can be leveraged
in order to improve mood,

2188
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,370
but it's actually the
inverse of everything

2189
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:58,293
we've been talking about up until now.

2190
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:02,520
We have a particular neural
circuit that originates

2191
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,940
with those melanopsin cells in our eye

2192
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:07,250
that bypass all the areas of the brain

2193
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,150
associated with circadian clocks,

2194
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,590
so everything related to
sleep and wakefulness,

2195
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:14,800
that's specifically
dedicated to the pathways

2196
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,010
involving the release of
molecules like dopamine,

2197
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:19,940
the neuromodulator that's
associated with motivation,

2198
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:23,870
with feeling good, with feeling
like there's possibility

2199
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,800
in the world, and so on and so forth,

2200
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,960
and other molecules as well,

2201
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,750
including serotonin and some
of those endogenous opioids

2202
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,150
that we talked about before.

2203
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:34,390
That particular pathway
involves a brain structure

2204
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:36,750
called the perihabenular nucleus.

2205
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,740
The perihabenular nucleus gets input

2206
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:43,440
from the cells in the eye
that respond to UVB light,

2207
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,790
and frankly, to bright light
of other wavelengths as well,

2208
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:49,490
'cause as you recall, if
a light is bright enough,

2209
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,360
even if it's not UV or blue light,

2210
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,870
it can activate those cells in the eye.

2211
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,770
Those cells in the eye

2212
01:30:54,770 --> 01:30:57,410
communicate to the perihabenular nucleus.

2213
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:01,110
And as it turns out, if
this pathway is activated

2214
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:04,780
at the wrong time of each 24-hour cycle,

2215
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:09,780
mood gets worse, dopamine
output gets worse,

2216
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:13,210
molecules that are there
specifically to make us feel good,

2217
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:16,103
actually are reduced in their output.

2218
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,460
So while UVB exposure in the
morning and throughout the day

2219
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,410
is going to be very
important for elevating

2220
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,530
and maintaining elevated mood,

2221
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:30,870
avoiding UVB light at
night is actually a way

2222
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:33,700
in which we can prevent activation

2223
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,920
of this eye to perihabenular pathway

2224
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,930
that can actually turn on depression.

2225
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:41,680
To be very direct and succinct about this,

2226
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,000
avoid exposure to UVB light
from artificial sources

2227
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,480
between the hours of 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.

2228
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,820
And if you're somebody
who suffers from low mood

2229
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,710
and overall has a kind of mild depression

2230
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:55,980
or even severe depression,

2231
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:57,930
of course, please see a psychiatrist,

2232
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:00,970
see a trained psychologist,
get that treated,

2233
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:05,970
but you would do especially
well to avoid UVB exposure

2234
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:09,610
from artificial sources, not
just from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am,

2235
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:13,000
but really be careful about
getting too much exposure to UVB

2236
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,410
even in the late evening,

2237
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:17,220
so 8:00 pm perhaps to 4:00 am.

2238
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,570
I can't emphasize this enough,

2239
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:21,790
that if you view UVB light,

2240
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,570
you activate those neurons
in your eye very potently.

2241
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:28,100
And if those cells communicate
to the perihabenular nucleus,

2242
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:28,933
which they do,

2243
01:32:28,933 --> 01:32:31,650
you will truncate or reduce
the amount of dopamine

2244
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:32,500
that you release.

2245
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:36,160
So if you want to keep your mood elevated,

2246
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,920
get a lot of light, UVB
light, throughout the day,

2247
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,870
and at night, really be cautious
about getting UVB exposure

2248
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:44,160
from artificial sources.

2249
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,960
Now let's say you're somebody
who has no issues with mood.

2250
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,540
You're just the happiest
person all year long,

2251
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:52,560
or maybe you just have subtle
variations in your mood.

2252
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,860
You feel great about that.

2253
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:57,940
Turns out that you still
want to be very careful

2254
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,570
about light exposure

2255
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:02,870
between the hours of 10:00
pm or so, and 4:00 am,

2256
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:05,030
in fact, even during sleep.

2257
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:06,840
There's a recent study that just came out

2258
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,750
in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,

2259
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,760
and it's entitled Light
Exposure During Sleep

2260
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,840
Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.

2261
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,690
This is a very interesting study

2262
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:20,220
where they took human
subjects, young adults,

2263
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,650
and having them sleep in rooms

2264
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:24,040
that had different lighting conditions,

2265
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,920
either dim light or slightly bright light.

2266
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,490
Now, many people can't fall
asleep in brightly lit rooms,

2267
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,978
so they acknowledge this.

2268
01:33:31,978 --> 01:33:33,960
These were not very brightly lit rooms.

2269
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,260
These were rooms that
had just a little bit

2270
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:39,260
of overhead room lighting, a hundred lux,

2271
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,290
which is not very bright at all.

2272
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:43,920
Or they had them sleep in a
room that had very dim light,

2273
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,800
which is less than three lux.

2274
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,160
If you want to get a sense
of how bright three lux is

2275
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,780
versus a hundred lux,

2276
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,910
I would encourage you to download
the free app Light Meter.

2277
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:55,420
I have no relationship to the app.

2278
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:56,580
It's a pretty cool app, however.

2279
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:57,580
I've used it for a long time,

2280
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:00,080
where you can basically point your phone

2281
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,360
at a particular light
source, sun or otherwise,

2282
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:03,290
and you just press the button

2283
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:05,620
and it'll give you an
approximate readout of lux,

2284
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,720
which is the light intensity

2285
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,170
that the phone happens
to be staring out at

2286
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:11,003
at that location.

2287
01:34:11,003 --> 01:34:14,080
It's not exact, but it's a pretty good

2288
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,460
back-of-the-envelope
measure of light intensity.

2289
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,410
So these subjects were either
sleeping in a very dim room,

2290
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:22,180
three lux is very, very dim,

2291
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:25,930
or a somewhat dim room, a hundred lux.

2292
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:29,210
In this study, they measured
things like melatonin levels.

2293
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,960
They looked at heart rate,

2294
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,940
they looked at measures of
insulin and glucose management.

2295
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,070
Now, in previous episodes,

2296
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:40,430
I've talked about how
glucose, blood sugar,

2297
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:42,430
is regulated by insulin

2298
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,960
because you don't want your glucose levels

2299
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:47,580
to be too high, hyperglycemia,
or too low, hypoglycemia.

2300
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:50,400
And the hormone insulin is
involved in sequestering

2301
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,520
and shuttling glucose in the bloodstream.

2302
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,410
Basically, how well you manage
glucose in the bloodstream

2303
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:58,490
can be indirectly measured
by your insulin levels.

2304
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:01,490
And it's well known that sleep deprivation

2305
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:06,490
can disrupt glucose regulation by insulin.

2306
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,400
However, in this study,
subjects were sleeping

2307
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,233
the whole night through.

2308
01:35:10,233 --> 01:35:12,170
It just so happens that some
of the subjects were sleeping

2309
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,937
in this very dimly lit room, three lux,

2310
01:35:13,937 --> 01:35:15,410
and other subjects were sleeping

2311
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:19,760
in a somewhat dimly lit
room, a hundred lux.

2312
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,730
What's incredible about this study

2313
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:24,180
is that both rooms were
sufficiently dimmed

2314
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:27,510
that melatonin levels were
not altered in either case.

2315
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:28,343
This is really key.

2316
01:35:28,343 --> 01:35:31,500
It's not as if one group
experienced a lot of bright light

2317
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,640
through their eyelids and others did not.

2318
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,570
Melatonin levels were not disrupted.

2319
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:38,280
And given how potently
light can inhibit melatonin,

2320
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,790
this speaks to the fact

2321
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:42,520
that this very dim condition of three lux

2322
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,890
and the somewhat dim
condition of a hundred lux

2323
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:48,070
was not actually perceived by the subjects

2324
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:50,760
nor was it disrupting
these hormone pathways.

2325
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,290
They also looked at glucose responses.

2326
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:56,480
They had people essentially
take a fasting glucose test

2327
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,380
in different conditions.

2328
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:58,950
I won't go into all the details,

2329
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:00,410
but here's what they found.

2330
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:04,440
In healthy adults, even
just one night of sleeping

2331
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,920
in a moderately lit environment,

2332
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,930
this hundred lux
environment, caused changes,

2333
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:12,630
increases in nighttime heart rate,

2334
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:14,440
which means that the
sympathetic nervous system

2335
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,620
was overly active as compared to people

2336
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,340
that slept in a completely dark

2337
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:20,900
or in a very, very dimly lit room.

2338
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,490
Decreases in heart rate variability,

2339
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:25,760
and here I should point out
that heart rate variability

2340
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,710
or HRV is a good thing, we
want heart rate variability.

2341
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:30,380
So they saw increases in heart rate,

2342
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,480
decreases in heart rate variability,

2343
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:36,360
and increases in next
morning insulin resistance,

2344
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:40,790
which is an indication that
glucose management is suffering.

2345
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:43,330
So this is powerful.

2346
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,860
The results of this study
essentially indicate

2347
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:49,140
that even just one night of
sleeping the whole night through

2348
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:52,490
in a dimly lit environment
is disrupting the way

2349
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:54,970
that our autonomic nervous
system is functioning,

2350
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:57,550
altering so called autonomic tone,

2351
01:36:57,550 --> 01:37:00,300
making us less relaxed
is probably the best way

2352
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,500
to describe it,

2353
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,130
even though we are asleep,

2354
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:04,460
disrupting the way

2355
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:07,570
that our cardiometabolic
function operates,

2356
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:09,860
such that we have lower
heart rate variability

2357
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:12,910
and increased insulin resistance.

2358
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:15,690
This is not a good thing
for any of us to experience.

2359
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,630
So while we've mainly been talking

2360
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:19,480
about the positive effects of UVB light

2361
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,210
and other forms of light,

2362
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,950
now we have two examples.

2363
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:25,270
One from the work of Hattar and colleagues

2364
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:28,800
showing that UVB exposure
via the perihabenula

2365
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,370
can diminish the output of dopamine

2366
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:33,090
and other molecules that make us feel good

2367
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:35,380
if that UVB exposure is
in the middle of the night

2368
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,810
or late evening.

2369
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:39,330
And now we have yet
another study performed,

2370
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:40,840
in this case, in humans,

2371
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,957
indicating that even if we fall asleep

2372
01:37:42,957 --> 01:37:44,580
and sleep the whole night through,

2373
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:47,540
if the room that we're
sleeping in has too many lux,

2374
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:48,860
too much light energy,

2375
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,860
that light energy is no doubt
going through the eyelids,

2376
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,930
which it can, activating
the particular cells

2377
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:57,930
in the eye that trigger an increase

2378
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:59,910
in sympathetic nervous system activation

2379
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:02,370
and disrupting our metabolism.

2380
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:05,660
And this study rests on a
number of other recent studies

2381
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,960
published in Cell, which
is a superb journal,

2382
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,210
and other journals, showing
that during the course

2383
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:13,090
of a healthy, deep night's sleep,

2384
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:14,187
our body actually transitions

2385
01:38:14,187 --> 01:38:16,800
through various forms
of metabolic function.

2386
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,420
We actually experience
ketosis-like states.

2387
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:23,000
We experience glucogenesis.

2388
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,240
We experience different
forms of metabolism

2389
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,230
associated with different stages of sleep,

2390
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:29,080
not something that we're
going into in depth

2391
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,800
in this podcast, we will
in a future podcast.

2392
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:35,970
What this study shows is that
light exposure even in sleep

2393
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:38,530
is disrupting our autonomic, in this case,

2394
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:40,950
the sympathetic arm of the
autonomic nervous system

2395
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:44,280
in ways that are disrupting
metabolism, probably in sleep,

2396
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:47,030
but certainly outside of
sleep so that we wake up

2397
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:48,450
and have our first meal of the day.

2398
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:49,700
Or even if you're intermittent fasting,

2399
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:51,320
you eat that first meal of the day,

2400
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:54,310
if your sleep is taking
place in an environment

2401
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:56,590
that's overly illuminated,

2402
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:59,310
well, that's disrupting
your cardiac function

2403
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,720
and your metabolism.

2404
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,480
I've been talking a lot about UVB light,

2405
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,150
which is short wavelength light.

2406
01:39:04,150 --> 01:39:05,270
So UV light, blue light,

2407
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:07,180
maybe even some blue green light,

2408
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:08,680
that's going to be short wavelength light.

2409
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:09,800
Now, I'd like to shift our attention

2410
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,160
to the other end of the spectrum,

2411
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,350
meaning the light spectrum,

2412
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:14,360
to talk about red light
and infrared light,

2413
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,250
which is long wavelength light.

2414
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,970
Many so-called low level light therapies,

2415
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:23,990
the acronym is LLLT, low
level light therapies,

2416
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:27,600
involve the use of red
light and infrared light.

2417
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,100
Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve the use of UVB,

2418
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,760
but more often than not these days,

2419
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,760
when we hear LLLT, low
level light therapy,

2420
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,540
it's referring to red light

2421
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:40,003
and near-infrared light therapies.

2422
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:44,610
Low level light therapies have
been shown to be effective

2423
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:47,640
for a huge number of biological phenomenon

2424
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,420
and medical treatments.

2425
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:50,940
I can't summarize all of those now.

2426
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,770
It would take me many, many hours.

2427
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:55,410
It would be an effective
episode for curing insomnia,

2428
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:58,810
but it wouldn't inform you
properly about the use of light

2429
01:39:58,810 --> 01:39:59,800
for your health.

2430
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,380
Rather, I'd like to just emphasize

2431
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,550
some of the top contour of those studies

2432
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:06,010
and point out that for instance,

2433
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:08,160
low level light therapy
with infrared light

2434
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,960
has been shown to be effective
for the treatment of acne

2435
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,000
and other sorts of skin lesions.

2436
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,200
There have been some really
nice studies actually

2437
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,010
where they use subjects as
their own internal control.

2438
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:19,150
So people, believe it or not,

2439
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:20,820
agreed to have half of their face

2440
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,910
illuminated with red light
or near-infrared light,

2441
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:26,050
and the other half of their
face serve as a control,

2442
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:28,330
and to do that for
several weeks at a time.

2443
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:31,100
And you can see pretty
impressive reductions

2444
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:35,220
in skin lesions, reductions
in scars from acne,

2445
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,220
and reduction in acne lesions themselves,

2446
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:41,020
meaning the accumulation of new acne cysts

2447
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:42,570
with low level light therapy,

2448
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,600
using red light and infrared light.

2449
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:49,280
Sometimes however, there is
a resistance of that acne

2450
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,620
to the low level light therapy,

2451
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,800
such that people will get
an initial improvement,

2452
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,700
and then it'll go away despite
continuing the treatment.

2453
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:58,270
So you're probably asking, or
at least you should be asking,

2454
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:00,770
how is it that shining
red light on our skin

2455
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:04,640
can impact things like acne
and wound healing, et cetera?

2456
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,760
Well, to understand that,
we have to think back

2457
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,370
to the beginning of the episode

2458
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:10,730
where I described how
long wavelength light,

2459
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:13,100
such as red light and near-infrared light,

2460
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,160
which is even longer than red light,

2461
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:19,180
can pass through certain
surfaces, including our skin.

2462
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:21,830
So our skin has an epidermis,
which is on the outside,

2463
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:24,440
and the dermis, which
is in the deeper layers.

2464
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,150
Red light and infrared light can pass down

2465
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:29,060
into the deeper layers of our skin,

2466
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:31,437
where it can change the metabolic function

2467
01:41:31,437 --> 01:41:32,900
of particular cells.

2468
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,650
So let's just take acne as an example.

2469
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:37,930
Within the dermis, the
deep layers of our skin,

2470
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:39,730
we have what are called sebaceous glands

2471
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:43,740
that actually make the oil
that is present in our skin.

2472
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:46,710
Those sebaceous glands are
often nearby hair follicles.

2473
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:49,313
So if you've ever had a
infected hair follicle,

2474
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:51,520
that's not a coincidence

2475
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,120
that hair follicles tend to get infected.

2476
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:56,270
Part of it is because there's
actually a portal down

2477
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:57,128
and around the hair follicle,

2478
01:41:57,128 --> 01:42:00,550
but the sebaceous gland is
where the oil is created.

2479
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:03,800
That is going to give rise to,
for instance, acne lesions.

2480
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:06,940
Also, in the dermis, in the
deep layers of the skin,

2481
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,020
are the melanocytes.

2482
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:08,960
They're not just in the epidermis,

2483
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,820
they're also in the
deeper layers of the skin.

2484
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,780
And you have the stem cells that give rise

2485
01:42:14,780 --> 01:42:16,860
to additional skin cells.

2486
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:19,240
If the top layers of the
epidermis are damaged,

2487
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,300
those stem cells can become activated.

2488
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,570
And you also have the stem cells

2489
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,380
that give rise to hair follicles.

2490
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:29,680
So by shining red light
or near-infrared light

2491
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,630
on a localized patch of skin,

2492
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:34,980
provided that red light is
not of such high intensity

2493
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,550
that it burns the skin,

2494
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,150
but is of sufficient
intensity that it provides

2495
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:42,480
just a little bit of damage to
the upper layers of the skin,

2496
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,860
the epidermis,

2497
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:47,240
and that it triggers
certain biological pathways

2498
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,540
within the cells of the sebaceous gland

2499
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:52,510
and the stem cells within
the hair cell niche

2500
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:54,050
and the stem cells in skin,

2501
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:56,690
what happens is the top layers of the skin

2502
01:42:56,690 --> 01:43:00,510
are basically burned off
by a very low level of burn

2503
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:02,460
and/or the cells in the deeper layer

2504
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,930
start to churn out new cells,

2505
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:07,400
which go and rescue the lesion,

2506
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:10,670
essentially clear out the
lesion and replace that lesion

2507
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:12,033
with healthy skin cells.

2508
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:17,470
This does work in the
context of wound healing,

2509
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:19,050
getting scars to disappear.

2510
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:23,010
It also works to remove certain
patches of pigmentation.

2511
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,010
There are sometimes cases

2512
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:26,900
where people will get a red blotchiness

2513
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,610
due to certain skin conditions

2514
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:31,370
or some darker pigmentation
that they want remove,

2515
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:32,610
or that they need removed,

2516
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:36,070
because it's a potential
skin cancer threat.

2517
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:37,880
Now, how is red light actually doing it

2518
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,550
within the cells of the sebaceous gland,

2519
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:41,040
the stem cells, et cetera?

2520
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,220
Well, long wavelength light

2521
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:45,220
can actually get deep into the skin,

2522
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:46,053
I mentioned that before,

2523
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:49,800
but can also get into individual cells

2524
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,760
and can access the so-called organelles,

2525
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,380
which I described at the
beginning of the episode.

2526
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,830
In particular, they can
access the mitochondria,

2527
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:58,560
which are responsible for producing ATP.

2528
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,580
Now, the simple way to think about this

2529
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:05,580
for sake of this discussion
is that as cells age,

2530
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:09,143
and in particular, in very
metabolically active cells,

2531
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:12,830
they accumulate what are called ROSs,

2532
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,010
reactive oxygen species.

2533
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:18,810
And as reactive oxygen species go up,

2534
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:22,390
ATP energy production in
those cells tends to go down.

2535
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:23,440
It's a general statement,

2536
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,210
but it's a general statement
that in most cases is true.

2537
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:29,910
There are some minor exceptions
that don't concern us

2538
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:31,963
that have to do with cell
types different than the ones

2539
01:44:31,963 --> 01:44:33,570
that I'm talking about now.

2540
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:35,900
So the way to think about
this is that red light passes

2541
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:38,020
into the deeper layers of the skin,

2542
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:40,970
activates mitochondria,
which increases ATP,

2543
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:43,360
and directly or indirectly reduces

2544
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,090
these reactive oxygen species.

2545
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:48,250
These reactive oxygen
species are not good.

2546
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,390
We don't want them.

2547
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:52,390
They cause cellular
damage, cellular death.

2548
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:55,150
And for the most part just inhibit the way

2549
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:56,700
that our cells work.

2550
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,590
So if you've heard of red light

2551
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:00,800
or near-infrared light therapies

2552
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,060
designed to heal skin
or improve skin quality

2553
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,080
or remove lesions,

2554
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,900
or get rid of scars or
unwanted pigmentation,

2555
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:12,390
that is not pseudoscience,
that is not woo science.

2556
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:15,670
That is grounded in the very
biology of how light interacts

2557
01:45:15,670 --> 01:45:18,410
with mitochondria and
reactive oxygen species.

2558
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,580
Some of you may also find
it interesting to note

2559
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,770
that some of the cream-based treatments

2560
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:24,290
for acne, for instance,

2561
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:26,630
like retinoic acid, Retin-A,

2562
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:30,070
is actually a derivative of vitamin A.

2563
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:33,760
And the pathway involving
retinoic acid and vitamin A,

2564
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:34,593
believe it or not,

2565
01:45:34,593 --> 01:45:38,560
is very similar to the
natural biological pathway

2566
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,900
by which photopigments in the
eye convert light information

2567
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:44,670
into biological changes
within those cells.

2568
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:47,580
So the key point here is that light

2569
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,300
is activating particular pathways in cells

2570
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,860
that can either drive death of cells

2571
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:55,730
or can make those cells
essentially younger

2572
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:57,730
by increasing ATP

2573
01:45:57,730 --> 01:46:00,570
by way of improving
mitochondrial function.

2574
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:02,530
And in recent years, there have been some

2575
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:05,410
just beautiful examples that exist,

2576
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:07,750
not only in the realm of skin biology,

2577
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:11,830
but in the realm of
neurobiology whereby red light

2578
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:13,810
and near-infrared light
can actually be used

2579
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:15,660
to enhance the function of the cells

2580
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,810
that, for instance, allow us to see better

2581
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:20,640
and indeed cells that
allow us to think better.

2582
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,350
So now I'd like to review those data

2583
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:25,690
because not only are they
interesting in their own right,

2584
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:28,530
but they also point to
some very interesting

2585
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:31,960
and powerful application of
low-cost or zero-cost tools

2586
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,500
that we can use to improve our vision.

2587
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,050
If you are somebody who's
interested in the use of red light

2588
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:38,910
or near-infrared light,

2589
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:41,770
so-called LLLT, low level light therapies,

2590
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:44,160
for treatment of dermatologic issues,

2591
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,950
so anything related to skin,

2592
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:49,200
I will include a link to a
excellent set of reviews.

2593
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,290
The first one is Light-emitting
Diodes in Dermatology:

2594
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:55,260
A Systematic Review of
Randomized Controlled Trials.

2595
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,520
That one includes review of a
very large number of studies,

2596
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,870
came out just a few years ago in 2018,

2597
01:47:00,870 --> 01:47:02,710
and I think is very clearly

2598
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:05,230
and cleanly laid out for anyone to access.

2599
01:47:05,230 --> 01:47:06,700
And you can see the degree of effects

2600
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:07,533
of red light, for instance,

2601
01:47:07,533 --> 01:47:09,400
on treatment of acne
or scarring, et cetera.

2602
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,060
And I'll also provide a
link to another review,

2603
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,350
which is Low-level Light Therapy in Skin:

2604
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:16,120
Stimulating, Healing, and Restoring.

2605
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,130
So for those of you that
are interested, again,

2606
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:19,480
in dermatologic issues

2607
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:21,980
and the kind of restoring youthfulness

2608
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:25,870
and the kind of general themes
of anti-aging and longevity

2609
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:28,770
and how red light therapies
can be used for that,

2610
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:31,380
I would encourage you to
take a look at those reviews.

2611
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:35,280
What you're going to find
is that rarely, if ever,

2612
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,190
is there a study looking at whole body

2613
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:38,880
red light illumination

2614
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,950
for sake of treating and improving skin.

2615
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:44,350
And I mention this because
I get a lot of questions

2616
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:48,190
about infrared sauna
and global illumination

2617
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:49,440
with red lights.

2618
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,200
We'll talk more about cases

2619
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,430
where global illumination
of your whole body

2620
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:56,590
or your whole face with
red lights might be useful,

2621
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:58,420
but in terms of infrared sauna,

2622
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,920
I've mentioned on this podcast before,

2623
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,430
and I will certainly go deeper on this

2624
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:02,440
in an upcoming episode,

2625
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,880
all about the use of heat and temperature

2626
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,980
for augmenting our biology,

2627
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:11,880
but in general, infrared
saunas don't get hot enough,

2628
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:14,930
temperature-wise, in order to trigger some

2629
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:16,810
of the important effects on growth hormone

2630
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:18,800
and heat shock proteins and
some of the other things

2631
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,990
that sauna has been shown
to be excellent for.

2632
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,930
That's a general statement.

2633
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:24,550
I realize there are some infrared saunas

2634
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:26,440
that do get hot enough.

2635
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:29,410
There are very few data on the use

2636
01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:32,620
of whole body illumination
with infrared saunas

2637
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,680
that really point to any specific

2638
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,430
mechanistically supported effects.

2639
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:39,410
Almost all the positive effects
that you're going to see

2640
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:41,900
of red light and
low-level light therapies,

2641
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,350
certainly the ones
discussed in the reviews

2642
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:44,220
that I just mentioned,

2643
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,840
are going to be the consequence

2644
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:50,740
of very directed illumination
of particular patches of skin

2645
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,190
that are seeking repair,

2646
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:54,300
that people are seeking the repair of.

2647
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,050
So again, I don't want to
disparage infrared saunas,

2648
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,410
but in general, they don't get hot enough

2649
01:48:59,410 --> 01:49:01,100
to trigger most of the positive effects

2650
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:03,900
that sauna have been demonstrated to have.

2651
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,030
And it's unclear at all
as to whether or not

2652
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:09,380
they can enhance skin
quality, youthfulness,

2653
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:14,200
restore top layers of
skin that are damaged,

2654
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,760
repair acne, et cetera.

2655
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,140
So more on heat saunas and infrared saunas

2656
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:20,720
and their comparison
in an upcoming episode.

2657
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,580
So let's talk about a
clear set of examples

2658
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:26,810
where red light and near-infrared light

2659
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:30,410
have been shown to have
positive effects on our health.

2660
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:32,920
And these are the data that I
referred to at the beginning

2661
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,210
of the episode from Dr. Glen Jeffery

2662
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:37,070
at University College London,

2663
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:40,620
who, again, is a longstanding member

2664
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,710
of the neuroscience community,

2665
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:43,260
working on visual neuroscience,

2666
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,450
and who over the last decade or so

2667
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:48,570
has really emphasized the
exploration of red light

2668
01:49:48,570 --> 01:49:51,550
and near-infrared light for restoration

2669
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:54,020
of neuronal function as we age.

2670
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:55,240
This is absolutely critical.

2671
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:59,410
We know that we don't
accumulate many new brain cells

2672
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:00,243
as we get older.

2673
01:50:00,243 --> 01:50:02,270
And in some areas of our nervous system,

2674
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:05,330
such as our neural retina,
which is the part of our eye,

2675
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:07,630
that's responsible for
translating light information

2676
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:10,200
to electrical signals so that we can see,

2677
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,810
we don't get any new cells after the time

2678
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:14,020
in which we were born.

2679
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,600
So the ability to keep our neurons healthy

2680
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,430
is extremely important
for our visual system,

2681
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:22,190
extremely important for our hippocampus,

2682
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:24,300
an area of the brain involved in memory.

2683
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,610
And I should just mention that even

2684
01:50:26,610 --> 01:50:28,080
if people don't get Alzheimer's,

2685
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:30,010
there's always going to be some degree

2686
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:31,900
of age-related dementia.

2687
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:35,700
Sadly, nobody is as cognitively sharp

2688
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:36,990
in the years before they die,

2689
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:39,240
as they are 20 years before that.

2690
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,360
It's just never the case.

2691
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,550
We're all getting worse at thinking,

2692
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:44,530
feeling, perceiving, et cetera.

2693
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:46,730
The question is how quickly
we are getting worse.

2694
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:49,590
So any mechanism by which we can preserve

2695
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:51,640
or reverse neuronal function

2696
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:54,393
turns out to be immensely beneficial.

2697
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:59,020
The Jeffery Lab has published
two studies in recent years

2698
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:03,540
on humans that looked
directly, no pun intended,

2699
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,830
at how red light and near-infrared light

2700
01:51:05,830 --> 01:51:08,330
can improve visual function.

2701
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:10,350
I'm going to describe the
parameters of those studies.

2702
01:51:10,350 --> 01:51:13,263
And then I'm going to describe
what they found, exactly.

2703
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:18,350
The mechanistic motivation
for these studies, again,

2704
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:22,520
traces back to this effect
of light on mitochondria.

2705
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:23,500
So to go a little bit deeper

2706
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,920
into that mechanism just briefly

2707
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:28,170
so that you can frame
any potential protocol

2708
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,453
that you would develop,

2709
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:35,640
when light arrives on
cells, including neurons,

2710
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:37,650
that light can penetrate into the cells

2711
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:39,020
if it's of the appropriate wavelength.

2712
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:40,820
Red light can do that,
it can get into cells,

2713
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:42,270
it can access the mitochondria,

2714
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:44,043
it can increase ATP.

2715
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:47,870
In general, anytime ATP is doing its thing

2716
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,100
to increase energy in cells,

2717
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:54,480
it's involving this thing
called cytochrome c,

2718
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:55,640
which is an oxidase.

2719
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:58,770
Anytime you hear ase, A-S-E, in biology,

2720
01:51:58,770 --> 01:51:59,830
it's going to be an enzyme.

2721
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:02,970
It's involved in some process
of degrading a molecule

2722
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:05,240
and creating another molecule, typically.

2723
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:08,480
So ATP and cytochrome c
is going to give you ATP.

2724
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:13,330
Now, that's a great thing,
but it creates a byproduct.

2725
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:16,120
It breaks things down, such
that you get these ROSs,

2726
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,120
these reactive oxygen species.

2727
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:19,900
And those reactive oxygen species,

2728
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,190
for those of you that want to know,

2729
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:23,900
are involved in things
like redox signaling.

2730
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:27,320
And reactive oxygen
species actually change

2731
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:29,610
which genes are made in a cell.

2732
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:32,300
So the goal of any
treatment is to keep neurons

2733
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,880
or other cells youthful
and functioning well,

2734
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,920
and to prevent or reverse aging,

2735
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,350
is going to be to increase ATP

2736
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:44,180
and to reduce reactive oxygen species,

2737
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:48,530
and in doing so, to disrupt
some of the normal pathways

2738
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:50,253
associated with aging.

2739
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:53,640
The Jeffery Lab approached these studies

2740
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:55,840
with that understanding
of how mitochondria

2741
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,420
and reactive oxygen species and ATP work.

2742
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:01,620
And what they did was exquisitely simple

2743
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,910
to the point of being elegant.

2744
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,290
And what they found was
really, really exciting.

2745
01:53:05,290 --> 01:53:08,650
What they did is they had people,

2746
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:11,450
subjects that were either
younger, so in their 20s,

2747
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:14,023
or 40 years old or older,

2748
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:18,010
view red light of about 670 nanometers.

2749
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:21,540
670 nanometers would
appear red to you and me.

2750
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,660
They, they had them do that, excuse me,

2751
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:25,660
at a distance that was
safe for their eyes,

2752
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:27,770
so at about a foot away.

2753
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:31,730
Now, a foot away from a
very intense red light

2754
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:33,060
could actually be damaging to the eyes,

2755
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,240
so they had them do this
at about a foot away

2756
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,990
from a red light that was
of low enough intensity

2757
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:39,990
that it did not damage the eyes.

2758
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:41,310
And they had them do that anywhere

2759
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:44,150
from two to three minutes per day.

2760
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:45,880
And in one study, they had them do that

2761
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,390
for a long period of
time of about 12 weeks.

2762
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:49,223
And in the other study,

2763
01:53:49,223 --> 01:53:51,720
they had them do that just
for a couple of weeks.

2764
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:54,600
What's remarkable is that
when you collapse the results

2765
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,130
across these two studies,

2766
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:58,710
what they found is that when
looking at these subjects

2767
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:02,920
ranging from 28 years old
to about 72 years old,

2768
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:06,430
the major findings were
that in individuals

2769
01:54:06,430 --> 01:54:08,960
40 years old or older,

2770
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:12,970
so in the 40 to 72-year-old bracket,

2771
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:16,650
but not in the subjects
younger than 40 years old,

2772
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:20,160
they saw an improvement
in visual function.

2773
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,500
That improvement in visual function

2774
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,820
was an improvement in visual acuity,

2775
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,900
meaning the ability to
resolve fine detail,

2776
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:30,520
and using a particular
measure of visual function,

2777
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:34,120
which is called the Tritan exam.

2778
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:36,940
T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan exam,

2779
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:40,370
which specifically addresses the function

2780
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:42,400
of the so-called short wavelength cones,

2781
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,040
the ones that respond
to green and blue light,

2782
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:48,880
they saw a 22% improvement
in visual acuity,

2783
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,270
which in the landscape of visual testing

2784
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:55,400
is an extremely exciting result.

2785
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:59,260
Okay, so I think in most studies
of improvements of vision,

2786
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:03,350
you'd be very excited to see
an improvement of 5% or 10%.

2787
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:06,560
So a 22% improvement in visual acuity,

2788
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,020
even though it's in
this very specific form

2789
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:12,733
of visual testing, this Tritan
exam or this Tritan score,

2790
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,050
well, that turns out
to be very significant

2791
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:20,230
and translates to the real
world in an important way.

2792
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:23,110
In particular, as we age,

2793
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:26,160
we tend to lose certain
neurons within our retina,

2794
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,550
but we don't tend to lose cones.

2795
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:30,210
We tend to lose rods.

2796
01:55:30,210 --> 01:55:32,320
We tend to lose other
cells within the retina,

2797
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,290
including the cells that
connect the eye to the brain,

2798
01:55:34,290 --> 01:55:35,840
the so-called ganglion cells.

2799
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,620
Cones, for whatever reason,

2800
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,260
are pretty resilient to age-related loss.

2801
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:44,510
However, because rods and cones both

2802
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:47,760
are not just among the most
metabolically active cells

2803
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,150
in your entire body,

2804
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:53,010
but the most metabolically
active cells in your entire body

2805
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:56,250
that's right, your rods and
cones are the cells that demand,

2806
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:59,893
and that use the most energy
of all the cells in your body,

2807
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:01,860
not your skin cells,

2808
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,760
not your spleen, not your stomach cells.

2809
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:04,960
Even if you talk a lot,

2810
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:07,180
not the cells that are
responsible for moving your mouth.

2811
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:09,720
It is the rods and cones
of your neural retina

2812
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:13,047
that are responsible for
using the most amount of ATP

2813
01:56:13,047 --> 01:56:15,660
and energy in your entire body.

2814
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,010
And because of that,

2815
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:19,710
those cells tend to accumulate a lot

2816
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:22,293
of reactive oxygen species as we age.

2817
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:25,410
Red light of the sort
used in these studies

2818
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:29,970
was able to reduce the amount
of reactive oxygen species

2819
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:33,380
in the rods and cones and
to rescue the function

2820
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:35,240
of this particular cone type,

2821
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,060
the short wavelength and
medium wavelength cones,

2822
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,500
which if you think about the study,

2823
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,750
is a little bit surprising,

2824
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:42,380
because it was red light
and near-infrared light,

2825
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:44,120
not short wavelength light,

2826
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:47,040
that was used in order to
create this improvement

2827
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,550
in cellular function.

2828
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:51,010
But if you step back a little bit further,

2829
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:54,750
it makes perfect sense because
there's nothing specific

2830
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:56,270
about the red light in the sense

2831
01:56:56,270 --> 01:56:59,590
that it gets delivered only to red cones.

2832
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:02,410
That red light and near-infrared
light is being absorbed

2833
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:04,690
by all the photoreceptors within the eye,

2834
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:06,670
the rods and the blue cones

2835
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:08,460
and the green cones and the red cones.

2836
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:11,800
It's just that the red cones
absorb that light best.

2837
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:14,580
So the important takeaway here

2838
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:17,880
is that viewing red light
and near-infrared light

2839
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,820
at a distance at which it is safe

2840
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:22,460
for just a couple of minutes each day

2841
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:25,940
allowed a reversal of the
aging process of these neurons,

2842
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:28,660
which some people have
heard me say before,

2843
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,350
and I'll just say it again,

2844
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:32,230
the retina, including your photoreceptors,

2845
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:34,210
are not just connected to your brain.

2846
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:35,310
They're not just near your brain.

2847
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,450
They are actual central
nervous system tissue.

2848
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:39,590
They are the only two
pieces of your brain,

2849
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:41,500
meaning your neuroretinas
are the only two pieces

2850
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,330
of your brain that reside
outside your skull,

2851
01:57:43,330 --> 01:57:45,050
or at least outside the cranial vault.

2852
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:48,300
So here we're seeing a
reversal of the aging process

2853
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,600
in neurons by shining red
light on those neurons.

2854
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,100
Now, of course, the Jeffery Lab

2855
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:55,750
is primarily interested in vision,

2856
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,090
and humans are most dependent on vision

2857
01:57:58,090 --> 01:57:59,910
as a sense to navigate
the world and survive.

2858
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:01,270
So this is really wonderful.

2859
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:03,070
Here, we're looking at a therapy

2860
01:58:03,070 --> 01:58:06,580
that can reverse age-related vision loss,

2861
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,730
at least in some individuals.

2862
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:09,610
But as you can imagine,

2863
01:58:09,610 --> 01:58:10,990
the study was also done on these cells

2864
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:13,110
because they reside outside the skull

2865
01:58:13,110 --> 01:58:15,360
and you can shine light
directly on them, right?

2866
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,020
I'm sure that there are
many people out there

2867
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:19,470
who are interested in how
they can improve the function,

2868
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:22,620
say, of the neurons in their
brain responsible for memory.

2869
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:23,453
And in a few minutes,

2870
01:58:23,453 --> 01:58:27,020
I'll describe the non-invasive
applications of light

2871
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:31,080
to try and restore the function
of those cells as well.

2872
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:35,013
So a little bit more about the
studies from the Jeffery Lab.

2873
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,200
One of the things that they observed was

2874
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:41,780
a reduction in so-called
drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.

2875
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:45,770
Drusen are little fatty deposits,

2876
01:58:45,770 --> 01:58:47,470
little cholesterol deposits,

2877
01:58:47,470 --> 01:58:49,920
that accumulate in the eye as we age.

2878
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,580
We've all heard about cholesterol

2879
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:53,130
within our veins and arteries

2880
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:55,690
and how that can clog
our veins and arteries

2881
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:58,760
and how, of course, clogging
of veins and arteries

2882
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,790
is not a good thing.

2883
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:02,580
Well, our neural retina
being so metabolically active

2884
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:04,170
requires a lot of blood flow.

2885
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:06,180
It's heavily vascularized,

2886
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:09,120
and drusen are a special
form of cholesterol

2887
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,300
that accumulate in the eye.

2888
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:12,930
As it turns out, these red light

2889
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:15,060
and near-infrared light therapies

2890
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:16,500
explored by the Jeffery Lab

2891
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:19,610
were able to actually reduce or reverse

2892
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:21,630
some of the accumulation of drusen.

2893
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:25,670
And so in addition to reducing
reactive oxygen species,

2894
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:28,010
the idea in mind now is that red light

2895
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:31,560
may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

2896
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:34,120
and reactive oxygen species

2897
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:36,560
in order to improve neuronal function.

2898
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,760
So what should you and
I do with these results?

2899
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,280
Or should we do anything
with these results?

2900
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,240
Well, first of all, I want to emphasize

2901
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,720
that even though these
studies are very exciting,

2902
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,970
they are fairly recent.

2903
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:49,010
And so more data, as always, are needed.

2904
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:50,690
There's some additional
features of these studies

2905
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,630
that I think are also
important to consider.

2906
01:59:52,630 --> 01:59:55,820
First of all, the exposure to red light

2907
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:58,410
needed to happen early in the day,

2908
01:59:58,410 --> 02:00:00,903
at least within the first
three hours of waking.

2909
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,140
How would one do that?

2910
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,670
Well, nowadays there are a number

2911
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:06,640
of different red light panels

2912
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:08,910
and different red light sources

2913
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:11,780
that certainly fall within
the range of red light

2914
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:14,300
and near-infrared light
that one could use.

2915
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:17,740
I don't have any affiliation
to any companies or products

2916
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:21,670
that promote or make
those red light therapies.

2917
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:23,430
I do own a red light panel,

2918
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:25,950
so I confess I have started
using this protocol.

2919
02:00:25,950 --> 02:00:27,820
I am older than 40 years old.

2920
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:30,930
I also have been experimenting
with these red light panels

2921
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:35,550
as a way of addressing other
changes in biological tissues,

2922
02:00:35,550 --> 02:00:37,180
for which I'm doing blood work, et cetera.

2923
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:39,520
And I'm going to talk about
that in a future episode,

2924
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:41,680
but that, of course, is
what I call anecdata.

2925
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,220
It only relates to my experience.

2926
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:46,420
So today, and certainly on all episodes

2927
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,740
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2928
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:50,750
we emphasize peer-reviewed
studies almost exclusively,

2929
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:52,050
talking about anecdata

2930
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:54,870
only when highlighting it as anecdata.

2931
02:00:54,870 --> 02:00:56,520
So if you're somebody who wants

2932
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:59,630
to explore red light therapy,
here's what you need to do.

2933
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:02,150
You need to make sure that
that red light source,

2934
02:01:02,150 --> 02:01:04,190
whatever source you happen to use,

2935
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:05,540
whether or not you
purchase it or make one...

2936
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,300
And in fact, these red light sources

2937
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:08,890
are very, very easy to make.

2938
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:11,630
You could essentially
take a bright flashlight

2939
02:01:11,630 --> 02:01:14,130
and cover it with a film or a filter

2940
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:17,420
that would only allow
particular long wavelengths

2941
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:18,253
to pass through.

2942
02:01:18,253 --> 02:01:19,880
This would be very easy to look up online

2943
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:20,750
and figure out how to do this.

2944
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:23,550
You could probably do this for,
you know, just a few dollars

2945
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,510
or you could purchase a red light unit

2946
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:27,470
if that was within your budget

2947
02:01:27,470 --> 02:01:29,000
and something that you're interested in.

2948
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,840
You want to make sure
that it's not so bright

2949
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:32,610
that you're damaging your eye.

2950
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:34,360
A good rule of thumb is that something

2951
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,920
isn't painful to look at.

2952
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,400
And in fact, I should just emphasize

2953
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,560
that any time you look
at any light source,

2954
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,500
sunlight or otherwise, that's painful

2955
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:43,050
and makes you want to
squint or close your eyes,

2956
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:44,910
that means it's too bright to look at

2957
02:01:44,910 --> 02:01:46,020
without closing your eyes.

2958
02:01:46,020 --> 02:01:47,420
Okay, that's sort of a duh,

2959
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:48,960
but I would loathe to think

2960
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,420
that anyone would harm themselves

2961
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:51,770
with bright light in any way.

2962
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,980
I don't just say that to protect us.

2963
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,870
I say that to protect you, of course,

2964
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:56,730
because you are responsible
for your health.

2965
02:01:56,730 --> 02:01:59,320
And again, retinal
neurons do not regenerate.

2966
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:02,170
Once they are gone and
dead, they do not come back.

2967
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:03,780
There's no technology to replace them

2968
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:06,270
at this current state in time.

2969
02:02:06,270 --> 02:02:08,400
So please don't damage your retinas.

2970
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,870
So is a red light source safe to look at

2971
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:13,500
if it is not painful to look at?

2972
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:14,580
Chances are it is.

2973
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:16,020
And yet I would still encourage you

2974
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:19,220
to talk to your optometrist
or ophthalmologist

2975
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:21,940
before getting into any
extensive protocols.

2976
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:23,230
But if you are still determined

2977
02:02:23,230 --> 02:02:25,050
to pursue the sorts of protocols

2978
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:26,270
that are in the Jeffery studies,

2979
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:28,450
certainly we'll provide
a link to those studies.

2980
02:02:28,450 --> 02:02:31,170
Again, it involved looking
at these red light panels,

2981
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:35,400
blinking aloud for two
minutes to three minutes

2982
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:40,793
every morning for a period
of two weeks or more.

2983
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:44,870
And if you're older than 40,

2984
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:46,240
that could very well have an effect.

2985
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:48,560
If you're longer, younger
than 40, excuse me,

2986
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,800
that's unlikely to have an effect.

2987
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,500
At least that was what was observed

2988
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,110
in these particular studies.

2989
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,560
The lights were not flashing.

2990
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:57,260
It was continuous illumination.

2991
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,840
Again, you're allowed to blink.

2992
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:00,660
It does not have to even
be direct illumination.

2993
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:02,500
It can be somewhat indirect illumination,

2994
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:06,260
much as we described for
the use of UVB light before.

2995
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:08,230
The wavelength of light is important.

2996
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:10,220
It is red light and near-infrared light

2997
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,050
that is going to be
effective in this scenario.

2998
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:16,760
The authors of this study
emphasized that it was red light

2999
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:20,270
of 670 nanometers in wavelength

3000
02:03:20,270 --> 02:03:25,270
and near-infrared light of
790 nanometers in wavelength

3001
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:26,870
that were effective

3002
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:29,760
and that those wavelengths
could be complimentary.

3003
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,240
That's probably why, or
maybe it's just coincidental,

3004
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,270
but it's a fortunate coincidence

3005
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:37,730
that a lot of the commercially
available red light panels

3006
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:38,563
that you'll find out there

3007
02:03:38,563 --> 02:03:41,510
combine both red light
and near-infrared light.

3008
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:44,310
However, I want to emphasize
that most of the panels

3009
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:46,120
that are commercially available

3010
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:50,520
are going to be too bright to
safely look at very close up.

3011
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:53,040
And in fact, that's why most
of those red light panels

3012
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:55,010
are designed for illumination of the skin

3013
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:57,560
and oftentimes arrive in their packaging

3014
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:00,080
with eye protectors that
are actually designed

3015
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:01,800
to shield out all the red light.

3016
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,260
So take the potential dangers
of excessive illumination

3017
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:09,290
of the eyes with any
wavelength of light seriously.

3018
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:12,850
But if you're going to explore
670 and 790 nanometer light

3019
02:04:12,850 --> 02:04:16,380
for sake of enhancing neuronal function,

3020
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:18,690
set it at a distance that's
comfortable to look at,

3021
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:20,380
and that doesn't force you to squint

3022
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:22,980
or doesn't make you feel
uncomfortable physically,

3023
02:04:22,980 --> 02:04:24,350
as if you need to turn away

3024
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:26,343
during the period

3025
02:04:26,343 --> 02:04:28,810
of that two to three-minute
illumination each day.

3026
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:32,430
In terms of turning away from light,

3027
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:36,040
I'll just briefly mention
that that is not an accident

3028
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,810
or a coincidence that
you have that response

3029
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:39,030
to very bright light.

3030
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:42,030
There is a so-called
photic avoidance pathway

3031
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:43,680
that involves cells within your retina,

3032
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,290
these ganglion cells that communicate

3033
02:04:45,290 --> 02:04:48,150
with yet another brain station,

3034
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:50,980
a certain area of your
thalamus that communicate

3035
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:53,610
to areas of your brain that
are associated with pain.

3036
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:55,380
So literally that can trigger headache,

3037
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:57,503
and that can trigger the squint reflex.

3038
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:00,470
Biology is just beautiful in this way.

3039
02:05:00,470 --> 02:05:03,520
Too much light is bad for us
in that it can damage our eyes

3040
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:05,190
and other aspects of our body.

3041
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:07,430
So if we look at a
light that's too bright,

3042
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:09,020
our eyes send a signal to the brain

3043
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:10,410
that gives us a sort of a headache

3044
02:05:10,410 --> 02:05:12,140
and a desire to squint and turn away.

3045
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:14,080
So that can be a useful guide

3046
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:16,740
in terms of gauging how
bright a light should be

3047
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:20,020
or at least how far away you
should be from a bright source

3048
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:23,140
in order to safely engage
with that light source.

3049
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:25,920
So the studies I just
described, once again,

3050
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,020
involve the use of red
light early in the day

3051
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,430
within three hours of waking

3052
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:31,800
and are for the sake of
improving neuronal function.

3053
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:35,810
Red light has also been
shown to be beneficial

3054
02:05:35,810 --> 02:05:38,200
late in the day and even
in the middle of the night.

3055
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:40,300
And when I say middle of the night,

3056
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:43,130
I'm referring to studies that
explore the use of red light

3057
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:44,640
for shift workers.

3058
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,420
I know that most people are not working

3059
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:48,070
in the middle of the night,
at least I hope they're not,

3060
02:05:48,070 --> 02:05:50,470
but some of you may do
that from time to time.

3061
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:51,480
All-nighters for studying,

3062
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,610
I confess I still pull
all-nighters every once in a while

3063
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:56,600
to prepare things like
podcasts and other deadlines.

3064
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,780
I really try not to, happens
less and less as I get older,

3065
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:01,590
because I think I get more disciplined

3066
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:05,010
and/or less good at pulling all-nighters.

3067
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:07,380
But I realize that many
people are doing shift work,

3068
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:09,790
or they have to work
certainly past 10:00 pm.

3069
02:06:09,790 --> 02:06:11,650
Or maybe they're taking
care of young children

3070
02:06:11,650 --> 02:06:14,090
in the middle of the night,
and they have to be up.

3071
02:06:14,090 --> 02:06:16,450
In that case, red light can
actually be very beneficial.

3072
02:06:16,450 --> 02:06:19,050
And nowadays there are a
lot of sources of red light

3073
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:20,880
available just as red light bulbs.

3074
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:21,970
You don't need a panel.

3075
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:25,260
So what I'm basically saying
is that it can be beneficial

3076
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:28,140
to use red lights at night.

3077
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:30,830
The study I'd like to emphasize
in this context is entitled,

3078
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:34,210
Red Light: A Novel
Non-pharmacological Intervention

3079
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:36,723
to Promote Alertness in Shift Workers.

3080
02:06:36,723 --> 02:06:38,040
It's a beautiful study.

3081
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:41,400
They explored the use of
different wavelengths of light,

3082
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,930
so blue light of 460 nanometers

3083
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:46,740
or red light or dim white light,

3084
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:49,540
of different brightnesses, et cetera,

3085
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:52,740
and looked at things like melatonin.

3086
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:55,190
How much does light of a given color

3087
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:56,850
and intensity suppress melatonin?

3088
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:58,620
They looked at cortisol, a stress hormone.

3089
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:00,370
They looked at wakefulness,

3090
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:03,640
how much or to what degree
could a given color of light

3091
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:06,250
increase wakefulness at
different hours of the day?

3092
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:08,340
The takeaway from this
study is very clear.

3093
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:11,393
If you need to be awake late
at night for sake of shift work

3094
02:07:11,393 --> 02:07:14,810
or studying or taking care
of children, et cetera,

3095
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:17,540
red light is going to be your best choice

3096
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:21,253
because if the red light
is sufficiently dim,

3097
02:07:22,150 --> 02:07:25,040
it's not going to inhibit
melatonin production,

3098
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:28,110
and it's not going to
increase cortisol at night.

3099
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:30,840
Cortisol should be high early in the day,

3100
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:32,390
or at least should be elevated relative

3101
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:34,520
to other times of day if you are healthy.

3102
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,870
A late shifted increase
in cortisol, however,

3103
02:07:36,870 --> 02:07:39,060
9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol,

3104
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:42,150
is well known to be
associated with depression

3105
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:44,360
and other aspects of mental health,

3106
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,400
or I should say mental illness.

3107
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:50,140
So if you do need to be awake
at night or even all night,

3108
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:53,660
red light is going to be
the preferred light source.

3109
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,410
And in terms of how bright to make it,

3110
02:07:55,410 --> 02:07:58,180
well, as dim as you can,

3111
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:00,090
while still being able
to perform the activities

3112
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:00,923
that you need to perform.

3113
02:08:00,923 --> 02:08:03,090
That's going to be your best guide.

3114
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:05,460
I'll provide a link to this study as well.

3115
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:08,150
Again, it's a really important study

3116
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:10,360
because it emphasized that
there are forms of light,

3117
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:12,280
red light, provided it's dim,

3118
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:15,420
that can allow you to
stimulate the alertness

3119
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:19,130
that light landing on
the eyes can provide.

3120
02:08:19,130 --> 02:08:20,230
So it allows you to stay awake

3121
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:22,550
and to do whatever work
that you need to do.

3122
02:08:22,550 --> 02:08:26,070
It does not seem to alter
melatonin production,

3123
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:26,903
so that's good.

3124
02:08:26,903 --> 02:08:28,920
It does not seem to alter levels

3125
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:31,040
or timing of cortisol production.

3126
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:34,720
So yet another case where
red light used correctly

3127
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:35,830
can be beneficial.

3128
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:37,040
Up until now, we've been talking

3129
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,785
about the effects of shining
different wavelengths of light

3130
02:08:39,785 --> 02:08:43,160
on the skin or on our eyes

3131
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:47,610
and the downstream health
consequences of that illumination.

3132
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:49,600
However, one of the most important goals

3133
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:52,050
of science and medicine is to figure out

3134
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:54,620
how to change the health of our brain.

3135
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:58,280
And of course, our brain is
contained within our skull,

3136
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:01,210
and therefore we can't just shine light

3137
02:09:01,210 --> 02:09:03,490
onto the outside of our head

3138
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:05,410
and expect it to change the activity

3139
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:07,030
of neurons deep within the brain,

3140
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:11,590
unless those neurons are
linked up with our eyes

3141
02:09:11,590 --> 02:09:12,620
or with our skin.

3142
02:09:12,620 --> 02:09:14,430
And as it turns out, even
though there are a lot

3143
02:09:14,430 --> 02:09:17,710
of brain areas that are
connected through neural circuits

3144
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:19,610
and hormone circuits through our eye,

3145
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:22,280
and believe it or not, also to our skin,

3146
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:24,163
many brain areas are not.

3147
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:27,830
Brain areas such as the hippocampus,

3148
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:30,280
which is involved in learning and memory,

3149
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:33,220
brain areas such as our neocortex,

3150
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:36,510
well, some areas of our neocortex
such as our visual cortex

3151
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:38,410
are indirectly linked to our eyes,

3152
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:39,660
so if we shine light in our eyes,

3153
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:42,450
we can change the activity
of neurons in our neocortex,

3154
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:44,970
but there are other brain areas

3155
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:48,860
that are not directly or
even indirectly connected

3156
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:50,100
to our visual system,

3157
02:09:50,100 --> 02:09:53,140
not at least in any immediate way.

3158
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:54,140
So that raises the question

3159
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:56,450
of how do you change the
activity of neurons in the brain?

3160
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:58,140
Well, there's pharmacology.

3161
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:01,100
You can take pills, you can inject drugs

3162
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:02,657
that will change the
pharmacology of neurons

3163
02:10:02,657 --> 02:10:04,860
and the way they operate and fire.

3164
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:07,810
Of course, antidepressants
are one such instance,

3165
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:09,750
opioid drugs are another.

3166
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:12,740
There's a huge array of
psychoactive compounds,

3167
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:14,730
meaning compounds that
will change the levels

3168
02:10:14,730 --> 02:10:16,800
of chemicals in your brain.

3169
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:17,680
Some of those work,

3170
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:20,730
many of them also carry side effects.

3171
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:22,580
It's all rather indirect,

3172
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:24,360
meaning you have lots of different cells

3173
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,340
in different areas of your brain

3174
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:26,670
that utilize the same chemicals.

3175
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:29,100
So a drug, for instance,
to increase serotonin

3176
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:31,540
for sake of improving depression

3177
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:33,590
will also often have the effect

3178
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:37,020
of reducing certain neurons

3179
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:39,010
output of serotonin in the hippocampus

3180
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:41,300
and cause changes in
appetite or changes in libido

3181
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:42,453
and so on and so forth.

3182
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:45,290
You could imagine using
electrical stimulation,

3183
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:46,480
putting wires into the brain

3184
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,550
and stimulating specific brain areas

3185
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:51,360
in order to activate the
neurons in those brain areas.

3186
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:54,010
And certainly that works and
has been done experimentally

3187
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:56,900
and is done during
neurosurgery exams, et cetera,

3188
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:59,650
but involves removing a piece of skull.

3189
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:01,340
So that's not very practical.

3190
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:04,390
In principle, light
would be a wonderful way

3191
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:08,510
to modulate the activity of
neurons deep within the brain.

3192
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:10,363
But again, the skull is in the way.

3193
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:14,430
Recent studies, however,
have figured out ways

3194
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:16,730
that light can be delivered to the eyes

3195
02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:20,250
to change global patterns
of firing in the brain

3196
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:22,690
in ways that can be
beneficial to the brain.

3197
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:25,530
And the work that I'm referring to now

3198
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:28,600
is mainly the work of Li-Huei Tsai at MIT,

3199
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:32,210
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and her colleagues.

3200
02:11:32,210 --> 02:11:34,880
And what they've discovered
that there's a particular

3201
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:38,970
pattern of brain activity
called gamma activity.

3202
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:42,100
Gamma activity is one so-called wavelength

3203
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:44,240
of electrical activity in the brain,

3204
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,270
so not wavelengths of light,

3205
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:48,010
but wavelengths of electrical
activity in the brain

3206
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:50,550
that can be restorative
for certain aspects

3207
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:51,600
of learning and memory

3208
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:55,210
and can actually help create
molecular changes in neurons

3209
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:57,650
that lead to clearance of debris

3210
02:11:57,650 --> 02:12:01,800
and even reductions in
age-related cognitive decline.

3211
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:06,800
So the way to think about brain
waves and brain oscillations

3212
02:12:06,970 --> 02:12:09,320
is that neurons are electrically active,

3213
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:11,150
that involves chemicals, et cetera.

3214
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:14,877
And they can be active in
very slow, big waveforms.

3215
02:12:14,877 --> 02:12:18,310
So you can think of, you
know, Delta waves, meaning,

3216
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:20,430
so you can imagine a wave
of electrical activity

3217
02:12:20,430 --> 02:12:22,240
that comes along very infrequently.

3218
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:24,280
So a given neuron fires,

3219
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:26,970
and then some period of time later fires,

3220
02:12:26,970 --> 02:12:29,730
and then some period of
time even later fires.

3221
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:32,550
Or you can imagine that that
same cell is very active,

3222
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:34,390
fires, fires, fires, fires, fires.

3223
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:36,050
You can imagine if it's firing very often,

3224
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:38,450
it's going to be short wavelength, right?

3225
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:40,380
Shorter gaps between firing.

3226
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:43,600
Or if it's firing very seldom,

3227
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:45,510
you're going to think about that

3228
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:47,310
as longer wavelength firing.

3229
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:51,070
Turns out that gamma waves
are one pattern of firing

3230
02:12:51,070 --> 02:12:54,810
that lead to downstream
metabolic functions

3231
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:57,380
and biological functions that
end up clearing away debris

3232
02:12:57,380 --> 02:13:00,250
that's associated with aging in cells

3233
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:03,340
and that also lead to molecular changes

3234
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:06,430
that enhance the kind of
youthfulness of neurons,

3235
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:07,263
so to speak.

3236
02:13:09,230 --> 02:13:12,450
How do we induce gamma
oscillations within the brain?

3237
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:15,730
Well, what Li-Huei Tsai and colleagues

3238
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:17,260
have beautifully shown

3239
02:13:17,260 --> 02:13:22,080
is that by delivering certain
patterns of light flicker,

3240
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:25,350
so lights going on and off
at a particular frequency,

3241
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:28,530
the brain as a whole starts to entrain,

3242
02:13:28,530 --> 02:13:30,900
meaning it matches to
those particular patterns

3243
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:31,733
of light flicker,

3244
02:13:31,733 --> 02:13:34,400
even though many of the
brain areas that do this

3245
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:38,710
are not directly within the
visual system or visual pathway.

3246
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:42,090
So the studies that I'm
referring to are several,

3247
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,950
but the one that I'd like
to highlight is entitled,

3248
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:46,820
Gamma Entrainment Binds
Higher-Order Brain Regions

3249
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:48,170
and Offers Neuroprotection.

3250
02:13:49,318 --> 02:13:50,670
What they essentially did

3251
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:54,870
was to expose subjects to 40 hertz,

3252
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:58,120
which is a particular
frequency of illumination,

3253
02:13:58,120 --> 02:13:59,170
to the eyes.

3254
02:13:59,170 --> 02:14:01,360
So it's light goes on, light goes off,

3255
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:06,250
light goes on, light goes off
at a frequency of 40 hertz.

3256
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:09,310
And when they did that and
they recorded the activity

3257
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:10,410
of neurons within the brain,

3258
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:12,960
not just within the
visual areas of the brain,

3259
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,870
but within other areas as well,

3260
02:14:14,870 --> 02:14:18,860
they observed increased
gamma oscillations,

3261
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:23,070
meaning that the electrical
activity of the brain at large

3262
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:26,110
started to match to the patterns of light

3263
02:14:26,110 --> 02:14:28,020
that were delivered to the eyes.

3264
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:29,770
This is really exciting and very unique

3265
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:31,720
from the different types of phototherapies

3266
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:33,220
that we've been talking
about up until now.

3267
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:35,210
All the patterns of phototherapy

3268
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:36,730
that we've been talking about up until now

3269
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:39,340
involved constant illumination
with a given wavelength.

3270
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:44,340
Here, it is wavelength generating
patterns of illumination,

3271
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:46,620
light on, light off, light on, light off,

3272
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,530
at a particular frequency.

3273
02:14:48,530 --> 02:14:49,780
So what they found, for instance,

3274
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:51,250
using this pattern of stimulation,

3275
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:53,690
and by the way, the
stimulation was called genus,

3276
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:56,180
gamma entrainment using
sensory stimulation,

3277
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:57,320
so G-E-N-U-S,

3278
02:14:57,320 --> 02:15:00,030
gamma entrainment using
sensory stimulation,

3279
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:01,610
had a number of really
interesting effects.

3280
02:15:01,610 --> 02:15:04,950
First of all, it reduced
so-called amyloid plaques

3281
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:06,710
and phosphorylated tau.

3282
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:08,400
Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau

3283
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,810
are associated with Alzheimer's

3284
02:15:09,810 --> 02:15:12,890
and normal age related cognitive decline.

3285
02:15:12,890 --> 02:15:14,653
So this is incredible, right?

3286
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:19,280
A pattern of flashing
light delivered to the eyes

3287
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,400
creates a pattern of neuronal firing,

3288
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:23,160
not just in the visual areas of the brain,

3289
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:25,640
but in other areas of the brain as well,

3290
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:28,750
that in turn trigger molecular pathways

3291
02:15:28,750 --> 02:15:32,050
that reduce some of the markers

3292
02:15:32,050 --> 02:15:35,580
and the cause age-related
cognitive decline in Alzheimer's.

3293
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:39,160
And in parallel to that,
they observed an upregulation

3294
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:40,939
of some of the biological pathways

3295
02:15:40,939 --> 02:15:43,530
that lead to enhancement
of neuronal function,

3296
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:44,660
maintenance of synapses,

3297
02:15:44,660 --> 02:15:46,530
which are the connections between neurons,

3298
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:48,350
and so on, and so on.

3299
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:50,850
They have discovered and
list out a huge number

3300
02:15:50,850 --> 02:15:52,450
of these biological effects,

3301
02:15:52,450 --> 02:15:55,300
both the reduction in
bad things, so to speak,

3302
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:59,120
and the improvement in
good biological pathways.

3303
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:02,100
And I find these studies so exciting

3304
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:05,600
because, first of all,
they're non-invasive, right?

3305
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,560
There's no drilling through the skull.

3306
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:11,790
They are very tractable
in the experimental sense,

3307
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:14,060
meaning that you can imagine

3308
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:15,970
that if 40 hertz stimulation turns out

3309
02:16:15,970 --> 02:16:17,860
to be the very best stimulation protocol

3310
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:20,400
to induce these gamma
oscillations, well, great,

3311
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:22,330
but because it's non-invasive,

3312
02:16:22,330 --> 02:16:25,140
it's fairly easy to explore
50 hertz stimulation,

3313
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:27,540
100 hertz stimulation,
20 hertz stimulation,

3314
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:30,247
and to do that with different
wavelengths of light.

3315
02:16:30,247 --> 02:16:31,830
And so that's what's happening now.

3316
02:16:31,830 --> 02:16:33,639
The Tsai lab and other
labs are really starting

3317
02:16:33,639 --> 02:16:36,699
to explore the full range of variables

3318
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:39,709
that can impact oscillations
within the brain

3319
02:16:39,709 --> 02:16:41,489
and their downstream consequences.

3320
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:43,639
So again, this is phototherapy,

3321
02:16:43,639 --> 02:16:45,509
but phototherapy of a very different sort

3322
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:47,889
that we've been talking
about up until now.

3323
02:16:47,889 --> 02:16:50,959
It's phototherapy designed
to trigger activation

3324
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:54,249
of biological pathways far
away from the very tissue

3325
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:55,260
that's being illuminated.

3326
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:57,017
And it calls to mind the
same sorts of mechanisms

3327
02:16:57,017 --> 02:16:58,360
that we were talking about earlier,

3328
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:00,870
where illumination of
the skin with UVB light

3329
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:03,150
is setting off an enormous
number of different cascades

3330
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:04,549
in different organs and tissues,

3331
02:17:04,549 --> 02:17:08,169
including the spleen, the
testes, the ovaries, and so on.

3332
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:11,790
So again, light has
these powerful effects,

3333
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:15,090
both locally on the cells that
the light is delivered to,

3334
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:18,469
but also systemically
in terms of the cells

3335
02:17:18,469 --> 02:17:21,699
that are changing their
electrical and chemical outputs,

3336
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:24,750
are modifying lots and lots
of biological programs.

3337
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:27,969
Is there an actionable tool
related to these studies yet?

3338
02:17:27,969 --> 02:17:30,289
Well, that sort of depends
on how adventurous you are.

3339
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:32,900
Right now, these studies
are being explored

3340
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,530
in the context of clinical trials,

3341
02:17:34,530 --> 02:17:36,350
in people with Alzheimer's, dementia,

3342
02:17:36,350 --> 02:17:38,533
and other forms of neurodegeneration.

3343
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:44,120
Is it dangerous to look at
a 40-hertz flickering light?

3344
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:46,860
Well, in general, the
answer is going to be no.

3345
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:50,020
However, if you're prone
to epilepsy, for instance,

3346
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:51,190
staring at a flickering light

3347
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:55,209
of a given continuous frequency
can induce seizure, right?

3348
02:17:55,209 --> 02:17:56,589
That might surprise some of you,

3349
02:17:56,590 --> 02:18:00,080
but it shouldn't, because
as this study illustrates

3350
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,620
and as anyone who's ever been out at night

3351
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:04,553
to a club or something illustrates,

3352
02:18:05,690 --> 02:18:07,830
when you look at a strobe
light, for instance,

3353
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:09,959
your whole world of
visual perception changes,

3354
02:18:09,959 --> 02:18:13,229
but actually, the rhythm at
which you perceive music,

3355
02:18:13,230 --> 02:18:14,469
at which you perceive conversation,

3356
02:18:14,469 --> 02:18:16,239
at which you perceive
the movement of your body

3357
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,740
actually changes according to the patterns

3358
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:19,750
of visual flicker,

3359
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:21,209
in most cases, strobe,

3360
02:18:21,209 --> 02:18:24,839
if we're using the sort
of club dancing example.

3361
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:28,129
Your brain is in training
to its outside environment.

3362
02:18:28,129 --> 02:18:30,859
So given the power of flickering lights

3363
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:33,139
to entrain brain rhythms,

3364
02:18:33,139 --> 02:18:36,539
I think at this stage, it's
probably too preliminary

3365
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:38,799
to really suggest a specific protocol,

3366
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:41,449
but I would definitely keep an eye out

3367
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:43,750
for these sorts of studies.

3368
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:45,320
They are coming out all the time.

3369
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:47,959
And I think in a very short period,

3370
02:18:47,959 --> 02:18:50,449
we are going to see specific protocols

3371
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:53,059
that one could use even at home,

3372
02:18:53,059 --> 02:18:54,929
and of course, these are
non-invasive protocols,

3373
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:58,719
in order to place the brain
into a particular state,

3374
02:18:58,719 --> 02:19:01,579
not just for sake of
offsetting neurodegeneration,

3375
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:03,930
but also for enhancing focus,

3376
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:05,950
for enhancing the transition into sleep,

3377
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:07,660
and other brain states as well.

3378
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:11,280
Today, I covered what I would
say is a lot of information.

3379
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,040
My goal was to give you an understanding

3380
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:16,719
of how light can be used
to change the activities

3381
02:19:16,719 --> 02:19:21,449
of cells, organelles within
those cells, entire organs,

3382
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:25,930
and how that can happen
locally and systemically.

3383
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:28,549
We talked about the power of
light to impact our biology

3384
02:19:28,549 --> 02:19:30,399
at the endocrine level, neuronal level,

3385
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:33,510
immune level, mood, et cetera,

3386
02:19:33,510 --> 02:19:36,680
through both illumination
of the eyes and the skin

3387
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:38,730
and other tissues as well.

3388
02:19:38,730 --> 02:19:42,389
I realize that even though
this was a lot of information,

3389
02:19:42,389 --> 02:19:46,419
there are many aspects of
phototherapy that I did not cover.

3390
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:48,540
I know there's a lot of
interest nowadays, for instance,

3391
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:52,190
in the use of red light and
other wavelength light therapies

3392
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:55,460
for ovarian health and testicular health.

3393
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:59,140
In fact, I get a lot of questions such as,

3394
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:02,230
can red light be used to
improve testosterone output?

3395
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:04,460
And if so, is that best accomplished

3396
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:06,760
by shining red light on the skin

3397
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:09,540
or directly on the
gonads, on the testicles?

3398
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:13,500
I'm going to cover those
data at a future time.

3399
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,260
Right now, the studies that
have been done in rodents,

3400
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:19,200
I don't think are easily
enough translated to humans.

3401
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,500
And the studies that are
happening in humans now

3402
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:24,560
are exciting in the sense that
they hold a lot of potential,

3403
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:27,580
but the data aren't clear yet.

3404
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:32,580
However, the data using UVB
on the skin of men and women

3405
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:35,270
in order to increase hormone,

3406
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:37,260
in particular testosterone
and estrogen output,

3407
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:39,420
those data, I think, are very exciting

3408
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:42,030
and very actionable when we
talked about those earlier.

3409
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:43,910
So if you want more information

3410
02:20:43,910 --> 02:20:45,650
on how phototherapy can be used,

3411
02:20:45,650 --> 02:20:48,830
certainly we will do another
episode on phototherapy

3412
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:50,670
in these other contexts.

3413
02:20:50,670 --> 02:20:53,040

02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:38,240
During today's podcast,

3436
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:39,650
we didn't really talk about supplements,

3437
02:21:39,650 --> 02:21:42,580
but we do talk about supplements
and their various uses

3438
02:21:42,580 --> 02:21:45,530
in many other episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3439
02:21:45,530 --> 02:21:47,940
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

3440
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:50,370
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.

3441
02:21:50,370 --> 02:21:52,700
For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,

3442
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:55,140
T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements

3443
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:57,910
are the very highest
quality and stringency.

3444
02:21:57,910 --> 02:22:00,180
If you'd like to see the
Thorne supplements that I take,

3445
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:04,150
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

3446
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:06,790
And there you can get 20%
off any of the supplements

3447
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:07,623
that I take.

3448
02:22:07,623 --> 02:22:10,720
And if you happen to navigate
deeper into the Thorne site,

3449
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:13,690
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

3450
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:16,430
you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements

3451
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:17,510
that Thorne makes.

02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:27,230
And at both places, I provide science

3457
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:28,230
and science-based tools,

3458
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:30,810
some of which overlap with
the content of this podcast,

3459
02:22:30,810 --> 02:22:33,630
much of which is unique from
the content of this podcast.

3460
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:35,760
If you're not already
subscribing to our newsletter,

3461
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:37,220
you might consider doing so.

3462
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:39,290
It's the so-called Neural
Network Newsletter.

3463
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,950
You can find it at hubermanlab.com.

3464
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:43,900
Just go into the menu, look
up Neural Network Newsletter.

3465
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:46,060
You provide email. It is zero cost.

3466
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:48,170
We provide summaries of podcasts,

3467
02:22:48,170 --> 02:22:50,580
summaries of actionable
protocols and so forth.

3468
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:52,920
We do not share your
email with anybody else,

3469
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:55,230
and we have a very clear privacy policy

3470
02:22:55,230 --> 02:22:58,350
there at that website if
you choose to explore it.

3471
02:22:58,350 --> 02:22:59,410
I'm also pleased to announce

3472
02:22:59,410 --> 02:23:01,280
that we have some live events coming up.

3473
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:02,810
So I will be giving a lecture

3474
02:23:02,810 --> 02:23:04,300
called the Brain Body Contract,

3475
02:23:04,300 --> 02:23:06,460
where I'll talk about science
and science-based tools,

3476
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:08,100
some of which overlap with the content

3477
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:09,270
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3478
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:10,350
much of which is unique

3479
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:12,990
and has never been
presented publicly before.

3480
02:23:12,990 --> 02:23:16,110
The first one is going
to be May 17th, 2022

3481
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:17,330
in Seattle, Washington.

3482
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:21,500
The second one is going to be
May 18th in Portland, Oregon.

3483
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:22,930
To access tickets, you can go

3484
02:23:22,930 --> 02:23:26,410
to the link at hubermanlab.com/tour.

3485
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:28,480
So thank you once again
for joining me today

3486
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:31,700
for this deep dive discussion
into phototherapies,

3487
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,840
meaning the power of light

3488
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:34,980
to modulate our biology and health.

3489
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:37,572
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

3490
02:23:37,572 --> 02:23:40,239
