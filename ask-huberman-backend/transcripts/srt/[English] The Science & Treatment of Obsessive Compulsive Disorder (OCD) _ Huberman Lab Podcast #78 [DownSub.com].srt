1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,481
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,300
[upbeat guitar music]

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm Andrew Huberman

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,110
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,060
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,080
Today, we are talking about
obsessive-compulsive disorder

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,560
or OCD.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,550
We are also going to talk

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,910
about obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder which,

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,890
as you will soon learn, is distinct

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,110
from obsessive-compulsive disorder.

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,450
In fact, many people that
refer to themselves or others

15
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,180
as obsessive or compulsive
or quote-unquote,

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,260
having OCD or OCD about
this or OCD about that

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,410
do not have clinically diagnosable OCD,

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,050
rather, many people have
obsessive-compulsive

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,940
personality disorder.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,520
However, there are many
people in the world

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,940
that have actual OCD,
and for those people,

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,650
there's a tremendous amount of suffering.

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,980
In fact, OCD turns out to be number seven

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,680
on the list of most
debilitating illnesses,

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,100
not just psychiatric
illnesses, but of all illnesses

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,220
which is remarkable and
somewhat frightening.

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,760
The good news is thanks to
the fields of psychiatry,

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,340
psychology, and science in general,

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,040
there are now excellent
treatments for OCD.

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,440
We're going to talk about
those treatments today.

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,960
Those treatments range
from behavioral therapies,

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,260
to drug therapies, and brain stimulation,

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,890
and even some of the more
holistic or natural therapies.

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,110
As you'll soon learn, for certain people,

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,900
they may want to focus more
on the behavioral therapies,

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,260
whereas for others, more
on the drug-based therapies

37
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,910
and so on and so forth.

38
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,650
One extremely interesting
and important thing

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,120
I learned from this episode

40
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,910
is that the particular
sequence that behavioral

41
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,910
and/or drug and/or holistic
therapies are applied

42
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,160
is extremely important.

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,720
In fact, the outcomes of studies

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
often depend on whether not people start

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,990
on drug treatment and then follow

46
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,810
with cognitive behavioral
treatment or vice versa.

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,340
We're going to go into all those details

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,160
and how they relate to
different types of OCD,

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
because it turns out there are indeed

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,940
different types of
obsessions and compulsions,

51
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,110
and the age of onset for
OCD, and so on and so forth.

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,330
What I can assure you is
by the end of this episode,

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,160
you'll have a much greater understanding

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,680
of what OCD is and what it isn't

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,740
and what obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder is

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,060
and what it is not.

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,720
And you'll have a rich array
of different therapy options

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,990
to explore in yourself or in others

59
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,280
that are suffering from OCD.

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,560
And if neither you or others that you know

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,420
suffer from OCD or obsessive-compulsive

62
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,880
personality disorder,
the information covered

63
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,520
in today's episode will
also provide insight

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,380
into how the brain and nervous system

65
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,930
translate thought into action generally.

66
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,180
And also, you're going to learn a lot

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,820
about goal-directed behavior generally.

68
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,320
My hope is that by the end of the episode

69
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,990
you'll both understand a
lot about this disease state

70
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,710
that we call OCD, you will
have access to information

71
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,750
that will allow you to
direct treatments to yourself

72
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,670
or others in better ways,

73
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,800
and that you will gain greater insight

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,260
into how you function and
how human beings function

75
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,130
in general.

76
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,110
The Huberman Lab Podcast
is proud to announce

77
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,330
that we've partnered with
Momentous Supplements.

78
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,620
We've done that for several reasons.

79
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,660
First of all, the quality
of their supplements

80
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,220
is exceedingly high.

81
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,290
Second of all, we wanted
to have a location

82
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,300
where you could find all of
the supplements discussed

83
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,540
on The Huberman Lab Podcast
in one easy-defined place.

84
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,890
You can now find that place
at livemomentous.com/huberman.

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,250
In addition, Momentous
Supplements ship internationally,

86
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,110
something that a lot of
other supplement companies

87
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,370
simply do not do.

88
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,260
So that's terrific whether
or not you live in the US

89
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,340
or you live abroad.

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,110
Right now, not all of the supplements

91
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,960
that we'd discuss on The
Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,

92
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,610
but that catalog of supplements

93
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,350
is being expanded very rapidly

94
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,090
and a good number of them
that we've talked about,

95
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,490
some of the more prominent
ones for sleep and focus

96
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,740
and other aspects of
mental and physical health

97
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,573
are already there.

98
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:50,430
Again, you can find them at
livemomentous.com/huberman.

99
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,050
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

100
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,280
that this podcast is separate

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

102
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,270
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

103
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,547
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

104
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,520
and science-related tools
to the general public.

105
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,950
In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors

106
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,420
of today's podcast.

107
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,460
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

108
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,710
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin-mineral

109
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,020
probiotic drink that also has adaptogens

110
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,640
and digestive enzymes.

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,399
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012

112
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,689
and I've taken it every day since

113
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,149
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

114
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,890
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

115
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,420
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

116
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,340
once or twice a day is that it covers

117
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,410
all of my foundational nutritional needs.

118
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,243
In fact, when people ask me,

119
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,110
"what's the one supplement I should take?"

120
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,700
I always say Athletic Greens

121
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,350
because by taking Athletic Greens,

122
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,970
you give support to your immune system,

123
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,190
to your endocrine system,
to your nervous system

124
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,080
and to the so-called gut-brain axis

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,460
and the gut microbiome.

126
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,900
As many of you've probably heard,

127
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,210
our gut, meaning everywhere from our mouth

128
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,680
down all the way through our intestine,

129
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,380
is populated by trillions
of little microbacteria

130
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,560
that support the different
systems of our body.

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,570
Athletic Greens has the
probiotics that support

132
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,490
the microbiome, and in
turn, support things

133
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,760
like mood, endocrine function,
immune system, and so on.

134
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,140
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

135
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,570
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

136
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,860
and claim their special offer.

137
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,690
They'll give you five free travel packs

138
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,450
plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

139
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,460
Many people are deficient in vitamin D3

140
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,470
and in general, vitamin D3 and K2

141
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,780
support a huge number of factors

142
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,550
in your brain and body
that support your immediate

143
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,690
and long-term health.

144
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,510
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

145
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,980
to claim their special offer.

146
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,500
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.

147
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,810
Thesis makes custom nootropics,

148
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,430
and frankly, I'm not a big fan

149
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,990
of the word nootropics.

150
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,430
I've said that on various podcasts

151
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,540
and on social media posts

152
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,030
and the reason I'm not a
fan of the word nootropics

153
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,110
is it means smart drugs.

154
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,730
But as a neuroscientist,

155
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,280
I know that we don't have
circuits in the brain

156
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,410
or chemicals in the brain for being smart,

157
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,540
we have circuits in the brain for focus

158
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,550
and for task switching and for creativity,

159
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,920
and oftentimes those circuits
differ from one another

160
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,630
although they collaborate to create things

161
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,340
that we think of as intelligence

162
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,620
or focus or creativity, et cetera.

163
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,720
Thesis understands this
and for that reason,

164
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,460
has developed custom nootropics

165
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,380
that match your particular goals

166
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,780
and to your particular biology.

167
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,890
They give you the opportunity to try

168
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,870
several different blends
over the course of a month

169
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,550
and discover which ones work best for you

170
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,080
and which ones don't.

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,640
In addition to that personalization,

172
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,010
they take it a step further
by offering free consultations

173
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,410
with a coach to help you
optimize your experience

174
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,780
and dial in your perfect formulas.

175
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,090
I've been using Thesis
for about eight months now

176
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,430
and I can confidently
say that their nootropics

177
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,230
are the best that I've ever used.

178
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,510
My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula

179
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,800
or the Motivation Formula

180
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,540
when I'm going to work or work out,

181
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,670
meaning when I'm going to
do focus cognitive work,

182
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,720
or I'm going to exercise.

183
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,450
I also like their Energy
Formula prior to exercise.

184

Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.

194
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,230
Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

195
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,350
that have cooling, heating,
and sleep tracking capacity.

196
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,910
I've talked many times on this podcast

197
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,220
and another podcast and on social media

198
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,930
about the critical relationship

199
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,510
between temperature and sleep.

200
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,940
Generally speaking, your
body temperature has to drop

201
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,980
by about one to three
degrees in order to get

202
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,110
into and to stay in deep sleep.

203
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,820
And waking up has a lot to do

204
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,320
with an increase in body temperature

205
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,060
of about one to three degrees.

206
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,010
So for many people like
myself who run warm

207
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,450
during the night, I find myself waking up

208
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,530
in the middle of the night.

209
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,760
However, recently I started using

210
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,047
an Eight Sleep mattress cover

211
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,210
and by programming in
the specific temperatures

212
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,070
that work for me across the night,

213
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,690
I'm staying asleep through the whole night

214
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,390
and as a consequence, I'm feeling
far better during the day,

215
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,950
much more focus, alertness, et cetera,

216
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,240
all the great things that come

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,150
from getting excellent sleep consistently.

218
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,590
The Pro Pod Cover by Eight Sleep

219
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,300
is their most advanced
solution on the market

220
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,800
for thermal regulation during sleep,

221
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,030
that's the one I use.

222
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,440
It pairs dynamic cooling and heating

223
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,550
with biometric tracking.

224
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,890
It also has this really nice feature where

225
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,660
your mattress basically
vibrates a little bit

226
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,850
right upon waking, I like that as well.

227
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,260
You can cover any mattress with it.

228
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,870
You can start sleeping as
cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit,

229
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,850
or as warm as 110 degrees Fahrenheit,

230
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,320
And that range is available to you

231
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,120
simply because Eight Sleep understands

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,890
that people have a tremendous range

233
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,010
in natural body temperatures
and sleeping environments.

234
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,030

242
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,730
Let's talk about OCD or
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

243
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,860
First of all, as the name suggests,

244
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,620
OCD includes thoughts or obsessions

245
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,559
and compulsions which are actions.

246
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,469
The obsessions and the
compulsions are often linked.

247
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,790
In fact, most of the time,

248
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,710
the obsessions and the
compulsions are linked

249
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,470
such that the compulsion, the behavior,

250
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,680
is designed to relieve the obsession.

251
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,570
However, one of the hallmark themes

252
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,610
of obsessive-compulsive disorder

253
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,160
is that the obsessions are intrusive.

254
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,930
People don't want to have them.

255
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,160
They don't enjoy having them.

256
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,020
They just seem to pop into people's minds

257
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,720
and they seem to pop into
their mind recurrently.

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,520
And the compulsions, unlike
other sorts of behaviors,

259
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,640
provide brief relief to the obsession,

260
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,870
but then very quickly reinforce
or strengthen the obsession.

261
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,000
This is a very key theme to realize

262
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,530
about obsessive-compulsive disorder

263
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,030
so I'm just going to repeat it again.

264
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,850
These two features, first,
the fact that the obsessions

265
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,940
are intrusive and recurrent,

266
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,880
as well as the fact that the
compulsions, the behaviors,

267
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,750
provide, if anything, only
brief relief for the obsessions,

268
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,610
but in most cases simply serve to make

269
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,000
the obsessions stronger
are the hallmark features

270
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,710
of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

271
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,180
And it turns out to be very important

272
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,550
to keep these in mind as we go forward,

273
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,520
not just because they define
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

274
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,290
but they also define
the sorts of treatments

275
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,970
that will and will not work

276
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,680
for obsessive-compulsive disorder.

277
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,270
And then once you understand a little bit

278
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,800
about the neural circuitry underlying

279
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,150
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

280
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,040
which we'll talk about in a few moments,

281
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,780
then you will clearly understand

282
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,120
why being a quote-unquote,
obsessive person

283
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,460
or having obsessive-compulsive personality

284
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,710
is not the same as OCD.

285
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,630
In fact, we can leap ahead a little bit

286
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,700
and compare and contrast OCD

287
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,160
with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder

288
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
along one very particular set of features.

289
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,170
Again, I'll go into this
in more detail later,

290
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,860
but it's fair to say
that OCD is characterized

291
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,530
by these recurrent and
intrusive obsessions.

292
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,510
And as I mentioned before,
the fact that those obsessions

293
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,090
get stronger as a function of people

294
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,530
performing certain behaviors.

295
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,600
So unlike an itch that you feel,

296
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,340
and then you scratch
it and it feels better,

297
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,590
OCD is more like an itch that
you feel, you scratch it,

298
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,870
and the itch intensifies.

299
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,510
That contour or that pattern of behaviors

300
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,880
and thoughts interacting is very different

301
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,340
than obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,

302
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,060
which mainly involves a sense
of delayed gratification

303
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,550
that people want and somewhat enjoy

304
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,350
because it allows them to function better

305
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,880
or more in line with how they would like

306
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,290
to show up in the world.

307
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,410
So again, OCD has mainly
to do with obsessions

308
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,550
that are intrusive and recurrent,

309
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,980
whereas obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder

310
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,260
does not have that
intrusive feature to it.

311
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,450
People do not mind, or in fact,

312
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,630
often invite or like the
particular patterns of thought

313
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,570
that lead them to be compulsive
along certain dimensions.

314
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,280
So leaving aside obsessive-compulsive

315
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,320
personality disorder for the moment,

316
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,750
let's focus a bit more on OCD and define

317
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,880
how it tends to show up in the world.

318
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,170
First of all, OCD is extremely common.

319
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,510
In fact, current estimates
are that anywhere

320
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,750
from 2.5% to as high as 3

321
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,010
or even 4% of people suffer from true OCD,

322
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,890
that is an astonishingly high number.

323
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,900
Now, the reason the range is so big,

324
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,200
2.5% all the way up to
3, or maybe even 4%,

325
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,230
is that a lot of the features of OCD

326
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,190
go unnoticed both in
the clinician's office

327
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,890
and simply because people don't report it

328
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,330
and don't talk about it.

329
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,160
In fact, it is possible to have recurrent

330
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,650
and intrusive obsessions and not engage

331
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,540
in the sorts of behaviors
that would ever allow

332
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,330
people to notice that somebody has OCD.

333
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,480
That can be because some
of the intrusive thoughts

334
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,430
don't actually lead to overt behaviors

335
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,840
like hand washing or checking

336
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,280
that other people would notice.

337
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,980
It can also be because people learn

338
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,590
to disguise or hide their obsessions

339
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,330
and their compulsions out of shame

340
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,660
or fear of looking strange
or whatever it might be

341
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,610
such that they have these obsessive

342
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,580
and intrusive thoughts, and
they do little micro-behaviors

343
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,770
like they might tap their
fingers on their thigh

344
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,410
as a way to avoid, at
least in their own mind,

345
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,180
something catastrophic happening.

346
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,850
That might seem crazy to you,

347
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,140
it might seem bizarre, but
this is the sort of thing

348
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,450
that operates in a lot of people.

349
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,980
And I really want to emphasize this

350
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,100
because the clinical
literature that are out there

351
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,060
really point to the fact
that many people have OCD,

352
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,160
full blown OCD, and never report it

353
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
because of the kind of shame and hiding

354
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,520
associated with it.

355
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,310
Another thing to point out is that OCD

356
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,740
is extremely debilitating.

357
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,150
I mentioned this a few minutes ago,

358
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,030
but OCD is currently
listed as number seven

359
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,610
in terms of the most
debilitating illnesses,

360
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,030
not just mental illnesses or disorders,

361
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,710
but all types of illnesses

362
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,530
including things like asthma
and cancer, et cetera.

363
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,340
So you can imagine with that
standing at number seven,

364
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,650
that it is both extremely common

365
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,120
and extremely debilitating.

366
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,640
And as a consequence, it's now realized

367
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,990
that many hours, days,
weeks, months, or even years

368
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,050
of work performance or showing up at work

369
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,780
of relational interactions really suffer

370
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,490
as a consequence of people having OCD.

371
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,800
So this is a vital problem
that the scientific

372
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,440
and psychiatric and psychological
communities understand.

373
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,560
And it's one of the reasons
that I'm doing this podcast.

374
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,410
And of course, I received
a ton of interest in OCD

375
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,047
because of this incredibly
high incidence of OCD

376
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:56,970
and how debilitating it is.

377
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,180
We could go really deep into
why it's so debilitating.

378
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,410
I don't want to spend
too much time on that

379
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,150
because I think most of
that is pretty obvious,

380
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,530
but some of it is not.

381
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,690
For instance, one of the
things that makes OCD

382
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,370
so debilitating is, of course,

383
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,200
the shame that we talked about before.

384
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,020
But it's also the fact that
when people are focusing

385
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,640
on their obsessions and their compulsions,

386
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,590
they're not able to focus on other things.

387
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,000
That's simply the way
that the brain works.

388
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,430
We're not able to focus on
too many things at once.

389
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,610
The other thing is that
OCD takes a lot of time

390
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,350
out of people's lives.

391
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,720
With recurrent intrusive
thoughts happening

392
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,060
at very high frequency, or
even at moderate frequency,

393
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,850
people are spending a lot of
time thinking about this stuff

394
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,770
and they're thinking about the behaviors

395
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,870
they need to engage in, and
then engaging in the behaviors,

396
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,890
which as I mentioned before,

397
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,207
just serve to strengthen the compulsions

398
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:41,580
and so they're not actually
doing the other things

399
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,350
that make us functional human beings

400
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,720
like commuting to work or doing homework

401
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,030
or doing work or listening
when people are talking

402
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,710
or interacting or sports or working out,

403
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,740
all the things that make
for a rich quality life

404
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,040
are taken over by OCD in many cases.

405
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,840
So while that might be obvious to some,

406
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,550
I'm not sure that it's
obvious to everybody

407
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,550
just how much time OCD can occupy.

408
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,250
Another thing you'll
soon learn is that sadly,

409
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,890
a lot of the obsessions
and compulsions in OCD

410
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,720
often relate to taboo topics.

411
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,750
And that's because the
general categories of OCD

412
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,480
fall into three different bins,

413
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,850
checking obsessions and compulsions,

414
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,250
repetition obsessions and compulsions,

415
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,410
and order obsessions and compulsions.

416
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,000
The checking ones are somewhat obvious,

417
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,310
checking the stove or checking the locks,

418
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,720
which I think we all tend to do.

419
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,510
I'm somebody typically
I'll head off to the car

420
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,097
to commute to work and I'll think,

421
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,150
did I lock the front door,

422
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,590
and I'll go back once,

423
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,840
but I won't go back twice or 50 times.

424
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,320
People with OCD will often
go back 20 or 30 times

425
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,510
before they'll actually allow
themselves to drive off.

426
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,790
And then it's a real challenge for them

427
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,340
to continue to drive off
and discard with the idea

428
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,570
that they didn't check the stove

429
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,650
or they didn't check the locks

430
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,320
or they didn't check
something else critical.

431
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,690
Repetition obsessions and compulsions,

432
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,870
obviously can dovetail
with the the checking ones,

433
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,030
but those tend to be
things like counting off

434
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,250
of a certain number of numbers,

435
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,110
like one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

436
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,520
seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

437
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,400
People perform that repeatedly,
repeatedly, repeatedly,

438
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,853
or feel that they have to.

439
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:13,230
I remember years ago
watching a documentary about

440
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,000
the band, The Ramones, right?

441
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,380
Most people heard of The Ramones, right?

442
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,180
Jeans, T-shirts, aviator glasses,

443
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,740
everyone had to change
their last name to Ramone.

444
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,000
They weren't actually all related

445
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,260
to one another, by the way.

446
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,520
You had to change your
last name to Ramone.

447
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,590
The Ramones had one band member

448
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,490
who was admittedly and known
to others as having OCD.

449
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,070
And during that documentary,
which I forget the name,

450
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,420
I think it was called,

451
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,410
can't remember, anyway,

452
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,140
can't remember, hippocampal lapse there,

453
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,580
but in this documentary,

454
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,760
the band members describe Joey Ramone

455
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,970
as leaving hotels, walking down the stairs

456
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,110
to the parking lot, but then having

457
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,910
to walk up and down them
seven or eight times,

458
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,530
and sometimes getting out of the van again

459
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,197
and walking up and down
them seven or eight times

460
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:53,610
and it always had to be a
certain number of times,

461
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,080
given a certain number of stairs.

462
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,700
This appears, quote-unquote, crazy,

463
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,010
but of course, we don't want
to think of this as crazy.

464
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,240
This is somebody who very
likely had full blown OCD.

465
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,190
Now that particular
example, believe it or not,

466
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,859
is not all that uncommon.

467
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,719
It just so happens that that example

468
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,670
entailed certain compulsions and behaviors

469
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,819
that were overt and that
other people could see.

470
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,889
And you can imagine how
that would prevent somebody

471
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,569
from moving about their daily life easily.

472
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,369
A lot of people, as I mentioned before,

473
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,769
have obsessions and
compulsions that they hide

474
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,300
and they do these little micro behaviors,

475
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,430
or they'll just count off in their head

476
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,650
as opposed to generating
some sort of walking up

477
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,440
and downstairs or tapping
or things of that sort.

478
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,000
So we have checking, we have repetition,

479
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,650
and then there's order.

480
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,080
Order oftentimes is thought of

481
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,480
as putting cleanliness

482
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,490
or making sure everything is aligned

483
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,740
and perfect and orderly.

484
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,390
And oftentimes that is the case,

485
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,740
but there are other forms of order

486
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,990
that people with OCD can focus on

487
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,720
in a obsessive and compulsive way.

488
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,690
Things like incompleteness, the idea that

489
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,370
one can't walk away from something

490
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,650
or stop doing something
because something's not right

491
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,570
or complete in that picture.

492
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,970
It could be the way the table is set.

493
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,100
It could be the way that
something's written on a page.

494
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,780
It could be an email.

495
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,690
Again, now we're still talking
about OCD, the disorder.

496
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,790
We're not talking about
obsessive-compulsive

497
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,860
personality disorder.

498
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm aware of, well, I'll just be direct,

499
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,510
several colleagues of mine
and it's just remarkable,

500
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,280
the order in their emails.

501
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,310
Every email is perfect,
punctuated, perfect,

502
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,920
grammar, perfect,
everything's spaced perfect.

503
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,820
Do they have OCD?

504
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,990
Well, they might, they might not.

505
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,350
How would I know unless
they disclose that to me.

506
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,600
But they might have obsessive-compulsive

507
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,180
personality disorder, or
they just might be able

508
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,920
to generate a lot of order

509
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,210
and they have a lot of discipline

510
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,980
around the way they write,
and the way they present

511
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,680
any communication with anybody at all.

512
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,880
So if somebody has a OCD
that's in the domain of order,

513
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,000
it could be incompleteness
and the constant feeling

514
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,890
of something not being completed

515
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,270
and a need to complete it.

516
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,190
It can also be in terms of symmetry,

517
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,740
that everything be aligned
in symmetric in some way.

518
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,920
This could be seen perhaps in young kids.

519
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,050
This is one example that
I read in the literature

520
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,600
of children that need to
arrange their stuffed animals

521
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,570
in exact same order every day

522
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,270
and in a particular order to the point

523
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,640
where if you were to move
the little stuffed frog

524
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,930
over next to the stuffed rabbit,

525
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,680
that the child would have
an anxiety reaction to that

526
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,520
and feel literally
compelled, driven to fix that

527
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,400
maybe even multiple times
over and over again.

528
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
We'll talk about OCD in children

529
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,400
versus adults in a little bit.

530
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,650
And then the other aspect of order,

531
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,900
which is a little bit less than intuitive,

532
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,610
is this notion of disgust,

533
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,470
this idea that something is contaminated.

534
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,280
So we often think about OCD
and hand washing behavior

535
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,810
in response to people feeling

536
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,250
that something is contaminated,

537
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,290
a space, a towel, et cetera,

538
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,510
or even simply somebody else's hand

539
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,820
and so they're unwilling
to shake somebody's hand.

540
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,520
You can imagine how these
different bins of obsessions

541
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,820
and compulsions, checking
repetition and order

542
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,130
be extremely debilitating
depending on how severe

543
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,410
they are and how many
different domains of life

544
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,790
they show up in.

545
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,710
Because oftentimes in movies

546
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,660
and even the way I'm describing it now

547
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,420
it sounds as if, okay, well
somebody has to check the locks

548
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,220
but they don't have to
also check the stove,

549
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,940
or somebody has the need to
count to seven back and forth

550
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,400
up to seven and down to seven seven times

551
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,370
seven times a day or
something of that sort

552
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,220
where they need symmetry in
very specific domains of life.

553
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,870
But it turns out that this recurrent

554
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,270
and intrusive aspect of obsessions

555
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,220
leads people with OCD

556
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,950
to have checking repetition

557
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,460
and/or order compulsions everywhere.

558
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,130
So whether or not somebody
is at work or in school

559
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,510
or trying to engage in sport

560
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,950
or trying to engage in relationship

561
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,620
or just something simple
like walking down the street,

562
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,930
the obsessions are so
intrusive that they show up

563
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,750
and they compel people to
do things in that domain

564
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,150
independent of whether or not

565
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,100
they happen to be in
one location or another.

566
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,737
In other words, the thought patterns

567
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,930
and the behaviors take
over the environment

568
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,280
as opposed to the environment

569
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,500
driving the thought
patterns and behaviors.

570
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,150
So it therefore becomes impossible

571
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,250
to ever find a room that's clean enough,

572
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,800
to find a bed that's made well enough,

573
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,770
to find anything that's done well enough

574
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,200
to remove the obsession.

575
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,937
And I know I've said
it multiple times now,

576
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:18,030
but I'm going to say it many
times throughout this episode

577
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,960
in a somewhat obsessive,
but I believe justified way

578
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,620
that every time that one
engages in the compulsion

579
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,820
related to the obsession,

580
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,820
the obsession simply becomes stronger.

581
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,350
So you can imagine what a powerful

582
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,390
and debilitating loop that really is.

583
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,770
So let's drill a little bit deeper

584
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,510
into how the obsessions and compulsions

585
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,890
relate to one another.

586
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,987
If we were to draw a line
between the obsessions

587
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:43,740
and the compulsions, that
line could be described

588
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,720
as anxiety.

589
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,880
Now, we need to define what anxiety is

590
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,920
and to be quite honest,

591
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,470
most of psychology and science can't agree

592
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,120
on exactly what anxiety is.

593
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,250
Typically the way we think about fear

594
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,070
is that it's a heightened
state of autonomic arousal,

595
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,990
so increased heart rate,
increased breathing,

596
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,720
sweating, et cetera, in
response to an immediate

597
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,360
and present threat or perceived threat.

598
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,580
Whereas anxiety, generally speaking

599
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,990
in the scientific literature,

600
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,740
relates to the same
sorts of thought patterns

601
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,380
and somatic bodily responses, heart rate,

602
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,580
breathing, et cetera,

603
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,730
but without a clear and present danger

604
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,010
being in the environment or right there.

605
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,860
So that's the way that we're
going to talk about anxiety now.

606
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,620
And anxiety is really
what binds the obsessions

607
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,480
and compulsions such
that someone will have

608
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,710
an intrusive thought.

609
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,200
So for instance, someone
will have the thought that

610
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,930
if they turn left on any street,

611
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,610
that something bad will happen.

612
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,540
Okay, that's an obsession.

613
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,430
It's actually not all that uncommon.

614
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,590
Now, how bad and what the specificity

615
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,420
of that bad thing really is will vary.

616
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,430
Some people will think, if I turn left,

617
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,840
something generally bad will happen,

618
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,190
it just makes me feel anxious,

619
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,110
So they always insist on going right.

620
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,230
Whereas other people will
think if I turn left,

621
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,200
so and so will die, or I will die,

622
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,450
or something terrible will happen,

623
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,670
I'll get a disease or someone
else will get a disease

624
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,650
or I'll be cursing myself or somebody else

625
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,630
in some very specific way.

626
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,860
This is unfortunately quite
common in people with OCD.

627
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,560
So they have this feeling

628
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,970
and the feeling can be generally

629
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,220
or specifically related
to a particular outcome.

630
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,070
But beneath that is a feeling of anxiety,

631
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,080
a quickening of the heartbeat,

632
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,550
a quickening of breathing,

633
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,310
a narrowing of one's visual focus.

634
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,110
I've talked about this
before in another podcast,

635
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,760
the Master Stress, another podcast

636
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
but if you haven't heard those,

637
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,580
let me just briefly describe

638
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,650
that when we are in a state of increased

639
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,480
so-called autonomic arousal, alertness,

640
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,190
stress, et cetera,

641
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,440
our visual field literally narrows,

642
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,960
the aperture of our
visual field gets smaller

643
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,220
and that's because of the relationship

644
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,600
between the autonomic nervous system

645
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,660
and your visual system, so
you start seeing the world

646
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,670
through sort of soda straw view

647
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,080
or through binocular-like view,

648
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,610
as opposed to seeing the big picture.

649
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,630
Why is that important?

650
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,800
Well, it literally sharpens
and narrows your focus

651
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,810
toward the very thing that the obsessions

652
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,100
and the compulsions are focused on.

653
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,230
So the person walking
down the street who sees

654
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,240
the opportunity to go left or right

655
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,660
will only see the bad decision,

656
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,540
their visual field narrows very tightly

657
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,210
along that possibility
of taking a left turn.

658
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,640
And I know as I describe this
seems totally irrational,

659
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,460
but I want to emphasize
that the person with OCD

660
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,440
knows it's irrational.

661
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,890
They might feel crazy because
they're having these thoughts,

662
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,990
but they know it makes no sense whatsoever

663
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,870
that left somehow would
be different than right

664
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,270
in terms of outcomes in
this particular case,

665
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,090
and yet it feels as if it would.

666
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,490
In fact, in some cases it
feels as if they went left,

667
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,830
they would have a full blown panic attack.

668
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,010
So the idea here is that the
obsessions and compulsions

669
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,190
are bound by anxiety, but then by taking

670
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,430
a right-hand turn, again, in
this one particular example,

671
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,910
by taking a right-hand
turn, there's a very brief,

672
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,690
I should mention, very
brief relief of that anxiety

673
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,590
at the time of the decision
to go right, not left

674
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,100
and there's an additional drop in anxiety

675
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,380
while one takes the right-hand turn

676
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,630
as opposed to the left-hand turn.

677
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,700
And then as I alluded to before,

678
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,310
there's a reinforcement of the compulsion.

679
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,140
In other words, by going right,

680
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,960
it doesn't create a situation in the brain

681
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,900
and psychology of the person
that, oh, you know what,

682
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,110
I'm not anxious anymore, left
would've probably been okay.

683
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,470
It reinforces the idea that
right made me feel better,

684
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,270
or turning right made me feel better,

685
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,700
and going left would've
been that much worse.

686
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Again, it reinforces the
obsession even further.

687
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,230
And again, we could swap out
right turns and left turns

688
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,910
with something like hand washing,

689
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,310
the feeling that something is contaminated

690
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,780
and the need to wash one's hands

691
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,060
even though one already washed their hands

692
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,160
20, 30, 50 times prior.

693
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,630
And we're actually going
to go back to that example

694
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,640
a little bit later when we talk about

695
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,530
one particular category of therapies

696
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,620
that are very effective
in many people for OCD

697
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,680
which are the cognitive
behavioral and exposure therapies.

698
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,880
I think some of you have heard

699
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,950
of cognitive behavioral
and exposure therapies,

700
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,110
but the way they're used to treat OCD

701
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,630
is very much different
than the way they're used

702
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,390
to treat other sorts of anxiety disorders

703
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,700
and other sorts of disorders generally.

704
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,230
So it's fair to say that up
to 70% of people with OCD

705
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,920
have some sort of anxiety
or elevated anxiety,

706
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,170
either directly related to the OCD

707
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,880
or indirectly related to the OCD

708
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,530
and it's really hard to tease those apart

709
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,680
because OCD can create its own anxiety,

710
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,740
as I mentioned before, it can
even increase its own anxiety.

711
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,710
And there's also an issue of depression.

712
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,500
Having OCD can be very depressing,

713
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,590
especially if some of these
OCD thoughts and behaviors

714
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,300
start to really impede people's ability

715
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,230
to function in life.

716
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,760
At work, and school, and relationship,

717
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,830
they can start feeling
less optimistic about life.

718
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,590
And in fact, some people can
become suicidally depressed.

719
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,380
That's how bad OCD can be for us.

720
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,660
So we have to be careful when saying

721
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,570
that 70% of people with
OCD also have anxiety

722
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,850
or X number of people with
OCD are also depressed

723
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,170
because we don't know whether or not

724
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,750
the depression led the OCD
or the other way around

725
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,890
or whether or not they're operating,

726
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,840
as we say in science, in parallel.

727
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,880
Some of the drug treatments
for OCD and depression

728
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,340
and anxiety can tease some of that apart

729
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,630
and we'll talk about that,

730
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,130
but I think it's fair to say that

731
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,000
what binds the obsessions
and compulsions is anxiety,

732
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,820
that there's a feeling of,

733
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,080
or I should say an
urgent feeling of a need

734
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,210
to get rid of the obsession.

735
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,190
And the person feels as if the only way

736
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,630
they can do that is to engage

737
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,400
in a particular compulsive behavior.

738
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,750
Some people are probably wondering

739
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,330
if there's a genetic component to OCD

740
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,980
and indeed there is,

741
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,560
although the nature of
it isn't exactly clear.

742
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,170
And oftentimes when
people hear that something

743
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,610
has a genetic component,

744
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,210
they think it's always directly
inherited from a parent,

745
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,680
and that's not always the case.

746
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,740
There can be genes that
surface in siblings

747
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,510
or genes that surface in children

748
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,580
that are not readily apparent

749
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,080
in terms of what we call a phenotype.

750
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,340
So you have a genotype, the gene,

751
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,470
and then you have a
phenotype, the way it shows up

752
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,230
as a body form or like eye color

753
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,870
or how it shows up in terms of a behavior

754
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,880
or behavioral pattern.

755
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,820
Based on twin studies where researchers

756
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,430
have examined identical
twins, fraternal twins,

757
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,880
even identical twins that
share the same sack in utero,

758
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,680
the what we call monochorionic,

759
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,290
so sitting in the same
little bag during pregnancy

760
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,760
or in different little bags,

761
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,840
you can see different levels

762
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,760
of what's called genetic concordance.

763
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,400
But if we were to just
sort of cut a broad swath

764
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,140
through all of the genetic data,

765
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,340
it's fair to say that about
40 to 50% of OCD cases

766
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,780
have some genetic component,

767
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,230
some mutation or some
inherited aspect that's genetic

768
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,070
and that one could point to

769
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,200
if they got their genome mapped.

770
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,310
Now, while that's interesting,

771
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,590
I don't think it's terribly
useful for most people.

772
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,960
First of all, you can't
really control your genes,

773
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
at least at this point in history,

774
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,220
even though there are things
like epigenetic control

775
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,110
and people are very
excited about technologies

776
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,220
like CRISPR for modifying the genome

777
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,643
in humans at some point,

778
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,640
most people can't control
their genetics, right?

779
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,770
You can't pick who your
parents were as they say.

780
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,170
So just know that there
is a genetic component

781
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,830
in about half of people
with OCD, but not always.

782
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,290
Now as is typical for this podcast,

783
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,960
I want to focus on some
of the neural mechanisms

784
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,150
and chemical systems in the brain and body

785
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,760
that generate
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

786
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,070
In fact, if you've watched
this podcast before,

787
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,600
listen to this podcast before,

788
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,310
this is always how I structure things.

789
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,560
First, we introduce a topic

790
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,390
and we explore that topic in detail

791
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,610
and really define what
it is and what it isn't.

792
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,190
And then it's very
important that we focus on

793
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,990
what is known and what is not known

794
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,170
about the biological
mechanisms that generate

795
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,760
whatever that thing happens
to be, in this case,

796
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,247
OCD and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

797
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:46,980
Now I want to emphasize
that even if you don't have

798
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,780
a background in biology,

799
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,760
I will make this information
accessible to you.

800
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,860
And I also want to emphasize
that for those of you

801
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,450
that are interested in treatments

802
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,350
and are anxiously awaiting
the description of things

803
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,040
that can help with OCD, I encourage you,

804
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,650
if you will, to please try and digest

805
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,660
some of the material about
the underlying mechanisms

806
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,760
because understanding
even just a little bit

807
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,250
of those biological
mechanisms can really help

808
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,980
shed light on why particular drug

809
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,087
and behavioral treatments

810
00:30:15,087 --> 00:30:18,120
and other sorts of treatments
work and don't work.

811
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,970
This is especially
important in the case of OCD

812
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,680
where it turns out that the order

813
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,480
and type of treatment can really vary

814
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,040
according to individual,

815
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,010
and that's something really
special and important about OCD

816
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,200
that we really can't say
for a number of the other

817
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,760
sorts of disorders that we've described

818
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,350
on previous podcasts.

819
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,700
So let's take a step back

820
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,680
and look at the neural circuitry.

821
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,800
What's going on in the brain
and body of people with OCD?

822
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,410
Why the intrusive recurrent thoughts?

823
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,430
Why the compulsions?

824
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,390
Why is that whole system bound by anxiety?

825
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,460
And in some ways in thinking about that,

826
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,840
I want you to keep in mind

827
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,623
that the brain has two main functions.

828
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,800
The brain's main functions are

829
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,900
to take care of all
the housekeeping stuff,

830
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,040
make sure digestion works,

831
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,030
make sure the heart beats,

832
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,190
make sure you keep
breathing no matter what,

833
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,220
make sure that you can see, you can hear,

834
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,450
you can smell, et cetera,

835
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,180
the basic stuff, and then
there's an enormous amount

836
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,490
of brain real estate that's designed

837
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,950
to allow you to predict
what's going to happen next,

838
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,920
either in the immediate future

839
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,100
or in the long-term future.

840
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,030
And largely that's done based
on your knowledge of the past.

841
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,480
So you also have memory systems.

842
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,000
And of course you have
systems in the brain and body

843
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,790
that are designed to bind what's happening

844
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,860
at the housekeeping level,
like your heart rate,

845
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,350
to your anticipation of
what's going to happen next.

846
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,090
So if you're thinking about
something very fearful,

847
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,650
your body will have one type of reaction.

848
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,300
If you're thinking about
something very pleasant

849
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,910
and relaxing, your body will
have another type of reaction.

850
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,940
So whenever I hear about
the brain-body distinction,

851
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,010
I have to just remind everybody

852
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,420
that there really is no distinction

853
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,520
between brain and body
when you think about it

854
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,480
through the nervous system.

855
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,030
The nervous system is the brain,
the eyes, the spinal cord,

856
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,410
but of course all their connections

857
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,550
with all the organs of the body

858
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,260
and the connections of
all the organs of the body

859
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,330
with the brain, the
spinal cord, et cetera.

860
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,880
So as I describe these neural circuits,

861
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,870
I don't want you to think of them

862
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,760
as just things happening in the head,

863
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,800
they are certainly happening in the head,

864
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,710
in fact, the circuits all
described most in detail

865
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,290
do exist within the confines
of your cranial vault,

866
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,030
that's nerd speak for skull,

867
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:19,170
but those circuits are
driving particular predictions

868
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,420
and therefore particular biases

869
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,490
towards particular actions in your body.

870
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,020
They're creating a state of readiness

871
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,710
or a state of desire to
check or desire to count

872
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,100
or desire to avoid et cetera, et cetera.

873
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,450
So what are these circuits?

874
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,480
Well, there's been a lot
of wonderful research

875
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,760
exploring the neural circuit's underlying

876
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,800
obsessive-compulsive disorder

877
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,940
and that's mainly been accomplished

878
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,500
through a couple of methods.

879
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,990
Most of those methods
when applied in humans

880
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,700
involve getting some look
into which brain areas

881
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,070
are active when people
are having obsessions

882
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,770
and when people are
engaging in compulsions.

883
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,390
Now that might seem simple to do,

884
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,510
but of course your brain is
housed inside the cranial vault.

885
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,800
And in order to look inside it,

886
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,110
you have to use things like
magnetic resonance imaging,

887
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,530
which is just fancy technology
for looking at blood flow,

888
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,040
which relates to activation
of neurons, nerve cells,

889
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
or things lik PET, P-E-T, imaging,

890
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,690
which has nothing to do with the verb pet

891
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,610
and has nothing to do with your house pet,

892
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,460
has everything to do with
positron emission tomography,

893
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,140
which is just another way of seeing

894
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,520
which brain areas are active

895
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,440
and then you can also
use PET to figure out

896
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,180
what sorts of neurochemicals are active,

897
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,220
like dopamine, et cetera.

898
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,640
Many studies, we can fairly say dozens

899
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,810
if not hundreds of studies,

900
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,630
have now identified a particular circuit

901
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,480
or loop of brain areas
that are interconnected

902
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,263
and very active in
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

903
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,370
That loop includes the cortex,

904
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,910
which is kind of the outer
shell of the human brain.

905
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,730
The lumpy stuff, as
it's sometimes appears,

906
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,200
if the skull is removed.

907
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,510
And it involves an area
called the striatum

908
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,220
which is involved in action selection

909
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,870
and holding back action.

910
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,180
The striatum is involved
in what's commonly called

911
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,460
go and no-go types of behaviors.

912
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,320
So every type of behavior
like picking up a pen

913
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,429
or a mug of coffee involves
a go type function.

914
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,529
It involves generating an action.

915
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,139
But every time I resist an action,

916
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,729
my nervous system is also doing that

917
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,880
using this brain structure, the striatum,

918
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,060
which includes, among other
things, the basal ganglia.

919
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,170
We've talked about that before.

920
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,179
I'm not trying to overload
you with terminology here,

921
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,519
but I know some people are
interested in terminology.

922
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,469
So you have go behaviors
and you have no-go,

923
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,922
resisting of behaviors,
not going toward behavior.

924
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,030
The cortex and the striatum
are in this intricate

925
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,989
back and forth talk.

926
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,369
It's really loops of connections.

927
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,110
The cortex doesn't tell
the striatum what to do,

928
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,090
the striatum doesn't tell
the cortex what to do.

929
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:45,989
They're in a crosstalk.

930
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,429
Like any good relationship, there's a lot

931
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,029
of back and forth communication.

932
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,699
There's a third element in
this cortico-striatal loop

933
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,069
as it's called, and that's the thalamus.

934
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,450
Now, the thalamus is not a structure

935
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,610
I've talked a lot about
before on this podcast,

936
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,040
but it's one of my favorite
structures to think about

937
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,630
and teach about in neuroanatomy,

938
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,520
which I teach back at Stanford

939
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,470
and I've taught for many years elsewhere

940
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,540
because the thalamus is this incredible

941
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,360
egg-like structure in
the center of your brain

942
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,520
that has different channels through it.

943
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,400
Channels for relaying visual information

944
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,550
or auditory information
or touch information

945
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,970
from your environment up into your cortex,

946
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,160
and as a consequence,
making certain things

947
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,620
that are happening to you and around you

948
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,600
apparent to you, making you aware of them,

949
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,440
making you perceive them
and suppressing others.

950
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,580
So for instance, right now,

951
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,170
if you're hearing me say this,

952
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,440
your thalamus has what are
called auditory nuclei,

953
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,850
there's collections of neurons

954
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,970
that respond to sound waves

955
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,980
that are of course coming
in through your ears,

956
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,713
and your thalamus is active in a way

957
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:52,320
that those particular
regions of your thalamus

958
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,980
are allowed, literally permitted
to pass the information

959
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,620
coming from your ears
through some other steps

960
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,630
but then to your thalamus,
your auditory thalamus,

961
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,190
then up to your cortex and you can hear

962
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,900
what I'm saying right now.

963
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,840
At the same time, your
thalamus is surrounded

964
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,920
by a kind of a shell,

965
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,990
something called the
thalamic reticular nucleus.

966
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,430
Again, you don't have
to remember the names,

967
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,200
but this thalamic reticular nucleus,

968
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,750
also sometimes called the
reticular thalamic nucleus,

969
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,240
this is, believe it or not, a
subject of debate in science.

970
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,920
There are people that
literally hated each other,

971
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,880
probably still hate each other,

972
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,920
even though one of them
is dead for decades,

973
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,930
because they would argue it
was thalamic reticular nucleus,

974
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,210
the other was reticular thalamic nucleus.

975
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,620
Anyway, these are scientists,

976
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,050
they're people, they tend to debate.

977
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,580
but the thalamic reticular nucleus,

978
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,380
as I'm going to call it,

979
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,330
serves as a sort of gate

980
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,790
as to which information
is allowed to pass through

981
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,850
up to your conscious
experience, and which is not.

982
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,190
And that gating mechanism
is strongly regulated

983
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,930
by the chemical GABA.

984
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,460
GABA is a neurotransmitter
that is inhibitory, as we say,

985
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,730
it serves to shut down
or suppress the activity

986
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,020
of other neurons.

987
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,650
So the thalamic reticular
nucleus is really saying,

988
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,190
no, touch information
cannot come in right now.

989
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,860
You should not be
thinking about the contact

990
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,960
of the back of your legs with the chair

991
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,890
that you're sitting on, Andrew,

992
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,540
you should be thinking about
what you're trying to say

993
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,220
and what you're hearing
and how your voice sounds

994
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,920
and what you see in
front of you, et cetera.

995
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,310
Whereas if I'm about to get
an injection from a doctor

996
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,560
or I'm in pain, or I'm in pleasure,

997
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,230
I'm going to think about
my somatic sensation

998
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,490
at the level of touch

999
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,990
and I'm probably going to think less

1000
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,760
about smells in the room,

1001
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,590
although I might also think
about smells in the room

1002
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,360
or what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing.

1003
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,360
We can combine all these
different sensory modalities,

1004
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,950
but the thalamic reticular nucleus

1005
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,990
really allows us to funnel,

1006
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,080
to direct particular categories
of sensory experience

1007
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,430
into our conscious awareness

1008
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,823
and suppress other categories
of sensory experience.

1009
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,330
In addition, the thalamic
reticular nucleus

1010
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,020
plays a critical role in which thoughts

1011
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,840
are allowed to pass up to
our conscious perception

1012
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,730
and which ones are not,

1013
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,400
so much so that some neuroscientists

1014
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,530
and indeed some neurophilosophers,

1015
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,670
if you want call them that,

1016
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,780
have theorized or philosophized that

1017
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,170
the thalamic reticular nucleus

1018
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,360
is actually involved in our consciousness.

1019
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,710
Now, consciousness isn't a topic

1020
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,330
that I really want to
talk about this episode

1021
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,670
and it's a very kind of mushy-murky,

1022
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,160
as we say in science, it's a shmooey term

1023
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,930
because it doesn't really
have clear definitions

1024
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,670
so arguments about it often get lost

1025
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,010
in the fact that people are
arguing about different things.

1026
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,450
But when I say consciousness,

1027
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,280
what I mean is conscious awareness.

1028
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,800
So let's zoom out and
take a look at the circuit

1029
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,450
that we've got and that we now know

1030
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,000
based on neuroimaging studies is

1031
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,130
intimately involved in
generating obsessions

1032
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,750
and compulsions in OCD.

1033
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,240
We have a cortex or neocortex,

1034
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,430
which is involved in
perception and understanding

1035
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,570
of what's happening.

1036
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,760
We have the striatum and basal ganglia,

1037
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,460
which are involved in
generating behaviors, go,

1038
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,500
and suppressing behaviors, no-go.

1039
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,900
And we have the thalamus which collects

1040
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,390
all of our sensory experience in parallel,

1041
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,580
hearing, touch, smell, et cetera,

1042
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,410
not so much smell through the
thalamus, I should mention,

1043
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,840
but the other senses that is.

1044
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,320
And then that thalamus is encased

1045
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,930
by the thalamic reticular
nucleus, which serves

1046
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,210
as a kind of a guard
saying you can pass through

1047
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,160
and you can pass through,
but you, you, you

1048
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,290
can't pass through up to conscious

1049
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,270
understanding and perception.

1050
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,790
So that loop, this
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,

1051
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,900
cortico-striatal-thalamic
loop is the circuit

1052
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,600
thought to underlie OCD,

1053
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
and dysfunction in that circuit

1054
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,290
is what's thought to underlie OCD.

1055
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,940
Now, again, this circuit
exists in all of us

1056
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,260
and it can operate in healthy ways,

1057
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,450
or it can operate in ways
that make us feel unhealthy

1058
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,510
or even suffer from full blown OCD.

1059
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,660
How do we know that this
circuit is involved in OCD?

1060
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,810
Well there, we can look to
some really interesting studies

1061
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,710
that involve bringing human
subjects into the laboratory

1062
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,020
and generating their
obsessions and compulsions

1063
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,610
and then imaging their brain using

1064
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,700
any variety of techniques
that we talked about before.

1065
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,230
What would such an experiment look like?

1066
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,630
Well, in order to do
that sort of experiment,

1067
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,720
first of all, you need people who have OCD

1068
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,910
and of course you need
control subjects that don't,

1069
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,160
and you need to be able to reliably evoke

1070
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,780
the obsessions and the compulsions.

1071
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,110
Now, it turns out this is
most easily, or I should say

1072
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,850
most simply done, 'cause it can't be easy

1073
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,900
for the people with OCD,

1074
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,240
but this is most straightforward,

1075
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,320
that's the word I was looking for,

1076
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,680
most straightforward when
looking at the category

1077
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,230
of obsessions and compulsions that relate

1078
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,110
to order and cleanliness.

1079
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,570
So what they do typically
is bring subjects

1080
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,450
into the laboratory who have a obsession

1081
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,580
about germs and contamination

1082
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,920
and a compulsion to hand wash,

1083
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,680
and they give these
people, believe it or not,

1084
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,010
a sweaty towel that contains the sweat

1085
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,030
and the odor and the

1086
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,500
liquid, basically, from
somebody else's hands.

1087
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,090
In fact, they'll sometimes have someone

1088
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,850
wipe their own sweat off
the back of their neck

1089
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,740
and put it on the towel
and then they'll put it

1090
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,660
in front of the person,
which as you can imagine

1091
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,990
for someone with OCD is
incredibly anxiety-provoking

1092
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,353
and almost always evokes
these obsessions about,

1093
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:04,410
ugh, this is really, this is really bad.

1094
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,591
This is really bad, I need to clean,

1095
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:07,424
I need to clean. I need to clean.

1096
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,670
Now they're doing all this while someone

1097
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,560
is in a brain scanner or

1098
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,400
while they're being imaged

1099
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,350
for positron emission tomography.

1100
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,310
And then they can also look at

1101
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,280
the patterns of activation in the brain

1102
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,020
while the person is doing hand washing.

1103
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,580
Although sometimes the apparati

1104
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,840
associated with these imaging studies

1105
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,340
make it hard to do a lot of movement,

1106
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,350
they can do these sorts of studies.

1107
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,090
They have done these sorts of studies

1108
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,270
in many subjects using
different variations

1109
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,380
of what I just described.

1110
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,255
And low and behold what lights up?

1111
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:35,250
And when I say lights up,

1112
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,740
what sorts of brain regions

1113
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,690
are more metabolically
active, more blood flow,

1114
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,530
more neural activity?

1115
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:44,850
Well, it's this particular
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.

1116
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,260
In addition to that,

1117
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,760
some of the drug treatments

1118
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,260
that are effective in some,

1119
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,480
and I want to emphasize some individuals,

1120
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,360
at suppressing obsessions
and or compulsions

1121
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,350
such as the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors

1122
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,800
or SSRIs, which we'll talk
about in a little bit,

1123
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,970
when people take those drugs,

1124
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,880
they see not just a suppression of

1125
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,460
the obsession and compulsion,

1126
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,330
but also a suppression of these
particular neural circuits.

1127
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,620
They become less active.

1128
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,200
Now I want to emphasize
and telegraph a little bit

1129
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,350
of what's coming later,

1130
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,020
these drugs like SSRIs do not
work for everybody with OCD.

1131
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,070
And as many of you know,

1132
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,530
they carry other certain
problems and side effects

1133
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,110
for many but not all individuals.

1134
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,970
But nonetheless, what we have now

1135
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,920
is an observation that this circuit,

1136
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,720
the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,

1137
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,070
is active in OCD.

1138
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,130
We have a manipulation that
when people take a drug

1139
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,540
that at least in those individuals

1140
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,640
is effective in suppressing or eliminating

1141
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,840
the obsessions and compulsions,

1142
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,880
there's less activity in this loop.

1143
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,610
And thanks to some very
good animal model studies,

1144
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,200
that at least at this point in time,

1145
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,090
you really couldn't do in humans,

1146
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,100
although soon that may change,

1147
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,140
we now know in a causal way

1148
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,850
that the equivalent circuitry
exists in other animals,

1149
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,190
such as mice, such as
cats, such as monkeys,

1150
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,880
and that activation of those particular

1151
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,130
cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits

1152
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,820
in animal models can indeed evoke OCD

1153
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,640
in an individual that prior to that

1154
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,290
did not have OCD.

1155
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,270
So I'm just going to
briefly describe one study.

1156
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,640
This is a now classic study published

1157
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,690
in the journal Science,

1158
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,810
one of the three apex journals in 2013.

1159
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,670
The first author on this paper

1160
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,180
is Susanne Ahmari, A-H-M-A-R-I.

1161
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,250
I will provide a link to
this in the show notes.

1162
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,350
It's a truly landmark paper done

1163
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,440
in Rene Hen's lab at Columbia University.

1164
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,460
And the title of the paper

1165
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,430
is repeated cortico-striatal
stimulation generates,

1166
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,270
that's the key word here,

1167
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,330
generates persistent OCD-like behavior.

1168
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,070
What they did is they took mice,

1169
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:49,200
mice do mouse things.

1170
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,670
They move around, they play with toys,

1171
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,590
they eat, they pee, they mate,

1172
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,360
they do various things in their cage,

1173
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,863
but they also groom.

1174
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,460
Humans groom, animals with fur groom,

1175
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,870
Well, you hope most people groom,

1176
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,330
some people over-groom,
some people under-groom,

1177
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,163
but most people groom.

1178
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,910
They'll comb their hair,
they'll clean, et cetera.

1179
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,820
Those are normal behaviors
that humans engage in.

1180
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,900
I'm not aware that mice comb their hair,

1181
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,130
but mice adjust their hair.

1182
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,117
So they'll kind of pet their hair

1183
00:44:12,117 --> 00:44:12,950
and they'll do this.

1184
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,670
They'll sometimes even
do it to each other.

1185
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,720
We used to have mice in the lab,

1186
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,980
now we only do human studies,

1187
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,860
but the mice will groom themselves,

1188
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,380
and typical, what we call wild type mice,

1189
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,250
not because they're wild,

1190
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,630
but because they're typical,

1191
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,690
will groom themselves at
a particular frequency,

1192
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,060
but not to the point where
their hair is falling out.

1193
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,150
Not constantly, they are
grooming some of the time

1194
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,720
and they're doing other mouse
things other mouse times.

1195
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,100
So in this particular study,

1196
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,040
what they did is they
used some technology,

1197
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,660
which it actually was discussed

1198
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,000
on a previous episode of
The Huberman Lab Podcast,

1199
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,400
this is technology that was
developed by a psychiatrist

1200
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,320
and bioengineer by the
name of Karl Deisseroth,

1201
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,320
one of my colleagues at
Stanford School of Medicine.

1202
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,270
This is technology that allows researchers

1203
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,880
to use the presentation of light

1204
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,780
to control neural activity
in particular brain areas

1205
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,210
in a very high fidelity way.

1206
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,480
You control the activity in
the cortex of the striatum

1207
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,830
or the thalamus when you
want and how you want.

1208
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,660
It's really a beautiful technology.

1209
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,900
In any event, what they
did in this study is,

1210
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,680
or I should say what Susan Ahmari

1211
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,240
and colleagues did in this study

1212
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,240
was to stimulate the
cortico-striatal circuitry

1213
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,950
in animals that did not
have any OCD-like behavior.

1214
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,210
And when they did that,

1215
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,460
those animals started grooming incessantly

1216
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,430
to the point where their hair
was falling out or they even,

1217
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,350
they didn't take the experiments
this far, fortunately,

1218
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,880
but the animals would have a tendency

1219
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,590
to almost rub themselves raw

1220
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,050
in the same way that
somebody who has a compulsion

1221
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,260
to hand wash would, sadly,
people will hand wash

1222
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,093
to the point where their hands

1223
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:42,510
are actually bleeding and raw.

1224
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,590
It's really that bad.

1225
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,600
I know that's tough imagery to imagine,

1226
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,490
and you can't even imagine
why someone would self harm

1227
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,090
in that way, but again,
that's that incredible anxiety

1228
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,070
relationship between the
compulsion, excuse me,

1229
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,930
the obsession and the compulsion,

1230
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,600
and the fact that
engaging in the compulsion

1231
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,190
simply strengthens the obsession

1232
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,600
and therefore the anxiety.

1233
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,590
So that collection of studies, of data,

1234
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,810
FMRI, PET scanning in humans,

1235
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,370
the treatment with SSRIs,
and these experiments where

1236
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,460
researchers have actively triggered

1237
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,250
these particular circuits in animal models

1238
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,780
that previously did not have

1239
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,070
too much activity in these circuits

1240
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,370
and then they observe OCD emerging

1241
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,140
really points squarely to the fact

1242
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,480
that the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop

1243
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,360
is likely to be the basis of OCD.

1244
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,940
Now, of course, other circuits
could also be involved,

1245
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,490
but the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit

1246
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,360
seems to be the main circuit
generating OCD-like behavior.

1247
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,740
That's a lot of mechanism.

1248
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,600
Hopefully it was described in a way

1249
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,460
that you can digest and understand.

1250
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,290
And some of you might be
thinking, well, so what?

1251
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,250
Why does that help me?

1252
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,780
I mean, I can't reach into my brain

1253
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,100
and turn off my cortex.

1254
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,650
I can't reach into my brain
and turn off my thalamus.

1255
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,500
And indeed, on the one hand, that's true.

1256
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,480
But as you'll next learn

1257
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,790
when thinking about the
various behavioral treatments

1258
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,200
and drug treatments

1259
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,570
and holistic treatments for OCD,

1260
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,490
what you'll notice is that each one taps

1261
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,840
into a different component

1262
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,780
of this cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.

1263
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,690
And by understanding
that, you can start to see

1264
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,270
why certain treatments
might work at one stage

1265
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,310
of the illness versus others.

1266
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,320
You will also start to understand why

1267
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,380
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

1268
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,750
does not have the same
sorts of engagements

1269
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,830
of these neural loops,

1270
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,300
and yet relies on other
aspects of brain and body

1271
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,750
and therefore responds best
to other sorts of treatments.

1272
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,930
Or in some cases, people
with obsessive-compulsive

1273
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,970
personality disorder are
not even seeking treatment

1274
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,350
as I alluded to before.

1275
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,790
The point here is that by understanding

1276
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,230
the underlying mechanism

1277
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,990
why certain drugs and
behavioral treatments work

1278
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,150
and don't work will become
immediately apparent

1279
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,420
and in thinking about
that, in knowing that,

1280
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,460
you'll be able to make excellent choices,

1281
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,220
I believe, in terms of what
sorts of treatments you pursue,

1282
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,900
what sorts of treatments you abandon,

1283
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,750
and most importantly, the order,

1284
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,020
the sequence that you pursue
and apply those treatments.

1285
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,390
Before we go any further,
I'd like to give people

1286
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,890
a little bit of a window into

1287
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,890
what a diagnosis for OCD would look like.

1288
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,110
Give you a sense of the sorts of questions

1289
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,600
that a clinician would ask to determine

1290
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,120
whether or not somebody has OCD or not.

1291
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,500
Now, I want to be clear,
I'm not going to do this

1292
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,670
in an exhaustive way.

1293
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,590
I wouldn't want anyone to self-diagnose.

1294
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,690
Although I'm hoping that
by sharing some of this,

1295
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,040
that some of you might get insight

1296
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,960
into whether or not you do have obsessions

1297
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,900
and compulsions that
might qualify for OCD,

1298
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,300
and perhaps even to seek out help.

1299
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,860
The most commonly used test of OCD,

1300
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,910
or for OCD, I should say,

1301
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,000
is called the Yale-Brown
Obsessive Compulsive Scale.

1302
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,580
And this is, scientists love acronyms

1303
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,857
as do the military, and it's the Y-BOCS,

1304
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:51,360
the Y-B-O-C-S, the Y-BOCS.

1305
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,700
So typically someone
will go into the clinic

1306
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,770
either because a family
member encouraged them to

1307
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,660
or because they feel
that they're suffering

1308
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,490
from obsessions and compulsions,

1309
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,460
and before the clinician would proceed

1310
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,020
with any kind of direct questions,

1311
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,550
they would very clearly define

1312
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,930
what obsessions and compulsions are.

1313
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,210
And here I'm actually
reading from the Y-BOCS.

1314
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,700
So quote, "obsessions are
unwelcome and distressing ideas,

1315
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,110
thoughts, images or impulses

1316
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,460
that repeatedly enter your mind.

1317
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,590
They may seem to occur against your will.

1318
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,880
They may be repugnant to you,

1319
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,530
you may recognize them as senseless

1320
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,380
and they may not fit your personality."

1321
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,790
Then there are compulsions.

1322
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,560
Quote, "Compulsions, on the other hand,

1323
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,720
are behaviors or acts that
you feel driven to perform

1324
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,020
although you may recognize
them as senseless or excessive.

1325
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,910
At times, you may try to resist doing them

1326
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,260
but this may prove difficult.

1327
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,720
You may experience anxiety
that does not diminish

1328
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,430
until the behavior is completed."

1329
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,680
And as I mentioned before in many cases,

1330
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,330
immediately after the
behavior has completed,

1331
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:45,630
the anxiety doesn't just return,
it indeed can strengthen.

1332
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,890
Now, there are a tremendous
number of questions

1333
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,723
on the Y-BOCS.

1334
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:49,680
So I'm just going to highlight

1335
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,280
a few of the general categories.

1336
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,780
Typically, the person
will fill out a checklist,

1337
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,600
so they will designate whether or not

1338
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,790
currently or in the past they have,

1339
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,190
for instance, aggressive obsessions,

1340
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,200
fear that one might harm themselves,

1341
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,910
fear that one might harm others,

1342
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,080
fear that they'll steal things,

1343
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,930
fear that they will act
on unwanted impulses,

1344
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,060
currently or in the past or both,

1345
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,110
that's one category.

1346
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,880
The other one are
contamination obsessions.

1347
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,530
So concern with dirt or germs,

1348
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,540
bothered by sticky substances or residues,

1349
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,590
et cetera, et cetera.

1350
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,510
So there are a bunch
of different categories

1351
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,330
that include, for instance,
sexual obsessions,

1352
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,490
what are called saving obsessions,

1353
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,470
even moral obsessions,

1354
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,870
excess concern with right
or wrong or morality,

1355
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,930
concerned with sacrilege and blasphemy,

1356
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,820
obsession with need for
symmetry and exactness.

1357
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,740
Again, all of these
questions being answered

1358
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,450
as either present in the past

1359
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,010
or not present in the past,

1360
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,170
present currently or
not present currently.

1361
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,290
And then the test generally

1362
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,860
transitions over to questions
about target symptoms.

1363
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,050
They really try and get people to identify

1364
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,630
if they have obsessions, what
are their exact obsessions?

1365
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,190
Now, this turns out to be really important

1366
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,320
because as we talk about some

1367
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,880
of the therapies that really work,

1368
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,260
I'll just give away a little bit

1369
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,080
of why they work best in certain cases

1370
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,810
and why they don't work
as well in other cases,

1371
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:09,390
it turns out that it
becomes very important

1372
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,340
for the clinician and the patient

1373
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,647
to not just identify the obsessions

1374
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:15,243
and the compulsions generally

1375
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:18,030
in a kind of a generic or top contour way,

1376
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,240
but to really encourage
or even force the patient

1377
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,110
to define very precisely what the biggest,

1378
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,510
most catastrophic fear is,

1379
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,760
what the obsession really relates to.

1380
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,410
That turns out to be very important

1381
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,470
in disrupting this
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop

1382
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,360
and getting relief from symptoms

1383
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,650
one way or the other.

1384
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,130
So the Yale-Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale, this Y-BOCS,

1385
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,420
again, is very extensive,

1386
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,690
it goes on for dozens of pages actually,

1387
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,000
and has all these different categories,

1388
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,790
not so much designed to just pinpoint

1389
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,290
what people obsess about

1390
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,810
or what they feel compelled to do,

1391
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,910
but to also try and identify

1392
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,970
what is the fear that's driving all this.

1393
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,160
In the way that we've
set this up thus far,

1394
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,020
we've been talking about
obsessions and compulsions

1395
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,910
is kind of existing in a vacuum.

1396
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,260
You're obsessed about germs

1397
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,180
and you're compelled to wash your hands,

1398
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,830
obsessed about germs,
compelled to wash your hands.

1399
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,240
Or obsessed about symmetry,

1400
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,220
compelled to put right
angles on everything.

1401
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,510
Or obsessed about counting

1402
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,370
and therefore counting, et cetera.

1403
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,650
But beneath that

1404
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,280
is a cognitive component
that is not at all apparent

1405
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,310
from someone describing their obsession

1406
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,550
and from someone describing or
displaying their compulsion.

1407
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,240
The deeper layer to all
that is what is the fear,

1408
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,800
exactly, if one were to
not perform the compulsion,

1409
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,100
meaning what is the fear
that's driving the obsession?

1410
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,340
So that brings us to a
very powerful category

1411
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,730
of treatments that I
should say does not work

1412
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,440
in everybody with OCD

1413
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,020
but works in many people with OCD

1414
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,310
and really speaks to the
underlying neural circuitry

1415
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,710
that generates OCD and
how to interrupt it.

1416
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,880
And that is the treatment

1417
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,220
of cognitive behavioral therapy

1418
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,060
and in particular,

1419
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,630
exposure-based cognitive
behavioral therapy.

1420
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,460
So we're going to talk about
cognitive behavioral therapy

1421
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,050
and exposure therapy now,

1422
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,850
but right at the outset,

1423
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,230
I want to distinguish the kinds

1424
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,400
of cognitive behavioral therapy

1425
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,810
and exposure therapies that are done

1426
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,187
for obsessive-compulsive disorder,

1427
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:19,050
for the sorts of cognitive
behavioral therapies

1428
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,910
that are done for other types

1429
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,990
of mental challenges and disorders

1430
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,510
because cognitive
behavioral therapy for OCD

1431
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,920
really has everything to do

1432
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,983
with identifying the utmost fear.

1433
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,110
In some sense, we can think of fears

1434
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,880
as kind of along a hierarchy.

1435
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,950
An the example earlier of somebody

1436
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,840
being afraid to turn left and therefore

1437
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,850
feeling compelled to turn right,

1438
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,170
you would want to take that person

1439
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,500
and really understand
what do they fear most

1440
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,460
about turning left?

1441
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,020
Now they might not be aware of it.

1442
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,390
They might not be conscious
to what that really is,

1443
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:53,700
but if you were to probe
them in a clinical setting,

1444
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,110
you would eventually get to an answer.

1445
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,660
That answer could be at first,

1446
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,310
I don't know, just, it's just bad.

1447
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,260
I don't know why it's
bad, it makes no sense,

1448
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,280
but it's just bad.

1449
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,420
I do not want to go left.

1450
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,830
I don't know why, I don't know why.

1451
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,080
But if you were to push
that person a little bit

1452
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,320
in a respectful and kind and caring way

1453
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,160
aimed at their treatment,

1454
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,993
if you were to push 'em and say,

1455
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:13,650
well, what do you mean by bad?

1456
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,200
If you turn left, you
think the world would end?

1457
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,850
They might say, no, the
world's not going to end,

1458
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,970
but you know, someone is
going to die suddenly.

1459
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:24,120
I know that sounds crazy, but
somebody's going to die suddenly.

1460
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,740
This almost sounds like superstition,

1461
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,030
we'll talk about superstitions later,

1462
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,370
but indeed it is somewhat superstitious.

1463
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,070
So for instance, you would
say, who's going to die?

1464
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,660
And they'd say, I don't know.

1465
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,850
And you'd say, no, really
who's going to die?

1466
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,440
If you think about this,
are you going to die?

1467
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,460
Is so and so going to die?

1468
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,560
And very often,

1469
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,050
very often what you find is that

1470
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,440
people will start to

1471
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,630
reveal the underlying obsession

1472
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,630
at a level of detail that
both to the clinician

1473
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,370
and to them can be somewhat astonishing

1474
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,170
even though they've been
living with that detail

1475
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,240
in their mind for a very long time.

1476
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,190
Now, how could somebody
start to reveal detail

1477
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,810
about something that's
existed in their mind

1478
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:04,230
for a very long time, but
not known about it, right?

1479
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,460
Not been aware of it.

1480
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,360
Now, some of you might think,

1481
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,010
oh, it's repressed or something.

1482
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,350
That's not at all what's happening.

1483
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,630
If you think about the
architecture of OCD,

1484
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,460
typically, people will have an obsession

1485
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,140
and then they'll engage in the compulsion

1486
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,660
as quickly as they can to
relieve that obsession.

1487
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,400
So in many ways, the disease itself

1488
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,430
prevents people from ever
getting to the bottom

1489
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,500
of that trough, ever getting to the point

1490
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,990
where they really clearly
articulate to themselves

1491
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,570
exactly what it is that they fear.

1492
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,450
But it becomes so essential to articulate

1493
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,910
exactly what it is that they fear

1494
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,830
for a somewhat counterintuitive reason.

1495
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,080
You might think, oh,
the moment they realize

1496
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,510
exactly what they fear, everything lifts,

1497
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,400
the circuit turns off
and they just feel better

1498
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,870
because they realized it.

1499
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,100
I wish I could tell you that's the case,

1500
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,840
but it turns out it's the opposite.

1501
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,180
What the clinician is
actually trying to do

1502
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:55,200
is get people to feel
more anxiety, not less.

1503
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,340
What they're trying to get them to do

1504
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,400
is to short circuit, no pun intended,

1505
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,650
to intervene in their own neural circuit,

1506
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,000
I should say, with that relief of anxiety,

1507
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,670
however brief, brought on by engaging

1508
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,740
in the compulsion
related to the obsession.

1509
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,800
So, whereas typically someone would feel

1510
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,797
the obsession with, ugh,
I don't want to turn left

1511
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:17,340
'cause something bad's going to happen,

1512
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,740
someone's going to die,
and then they turn right,

1513
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,680
they never get the
option or the opportunity

1514
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,560
to really explore what would happen

1515
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,560
were they to turn left or to
not be able to turn right.

1516
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,020
By forcing them down the path of inquiry,

1517
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,990
that leads them to the place
where they very clearly

1518
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,200
identify the fear, the anxiety,

1519
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,540
it raises the anxiety in them,

1520
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,710
and that's actually what
the clinician is after.

1521
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,100
Cognitive behavioral
therapy and exposure therapy

1522
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,100
in the context of OCD, most often involves

1523
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,710
trying to get people to tolerate,

1524
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,930
not relieve their anxiety.

1525
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,340
This is extremely important.

1526
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,620
And I realize there's variation to this

1527
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,620
depending on the style of
cognitive behavioral therapy,

1528
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,520
the style of exposure therapy,
but almost across the board,

1529
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,540
The goal, again, is to get
people to feel the anxiety

1530
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,870
that normally they are able
to at least partially relieve,

1531
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,870
however briefly, by
engaging in the compulsion.

1532
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,180
So if we think back to that circuit

1533
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,150
of cortico-striatal-thalamic,
what's going on here?

1534
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,460
Where is CBT intervening?

1535
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,370
What part of the circuit
is getting interrupted?

1536
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:27,203
Well, as you recall,

1537
00:57:27,203 --> 00:57:29,400
the cortex is involved
in conscious perception.

1538
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,620
The thalamus and that
thalamic reticular nucleus

1539
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,860
are involved in the
passage of certain types

1540
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,100
of experience up to our
conscious perception, not others.

1541
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,210
And the striatum is involved

1542
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,450
in this go, no-go type behavior.

1543
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:47,250
When OCD is really expressing
itself in its fullness,

1544
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,160
people feel an anxiety
around a particular thought

1545
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,220
and they either have a go,

1546
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,660
for instance, wash hands,

1547
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:58,533
or a no-go, do not turn
left type reaction.

1548
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,650
By having people progressively,

1549
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,600
in a kind of hierarchical way,

1550
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,600
reveal their precise source of anxiety,

1551
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,793
their utmost fear in this context,

1552
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,090
what happens is they feel enormous amounts

1553
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,830
of autonomic arousal.

1554
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,410
Now in the context of anxiety treatment

1555
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,700
or other types of treatments,

1556
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,770
the goal would be to
teach people to dampen,

1557
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,380
to lessen their anxiety
through breathing techniques

1558
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,780
or through visualization techniques

1559
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,240
or through self-talk or
through social support,

1560
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,950
any of the number of
things that are well-known

1561
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,440
to help people self
regulate their own anxiety.

1562
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,880
Here, it's the opposite.

1563
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,100
What they're trying to
get the patient to do

1564
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,310
is to really feel the
anxiety at its maximum,

1565
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,140
but then do the exact opposite

1566
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,820
of whatever the normal compulsion is.

1567
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,310
So if normally the compulsion
is to wash one's hands,

1568
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,680
then the idea is to suppress hand washing

1569
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,830
while being in the experience
of the utmost anxiety.

1570
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,740
Or in the case of not turning left,

1571
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,290
the person is expected to

1572
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:59,253
or would hopefully be able
to actually turn left,

1573
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:04,050
and as you can imagine, that
would evoke tremendous anxiety

1574
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,120
and yet to tolerate that anxiety.

1575
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,990
Now I want to be very clear,

1576
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,970
this is not the sort of thing
you want to do on your own.

1577
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,860
This is not the sort of thing
you want to do for a friend.

1578
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,460
This is done by trained
licensed psychologists

1579
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,960
and psychiatrists.

1580
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,230
But nonetheless, it
really points to the fact

1581
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,530
that as a anxiety-related disorder,

1582
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:25,650
OCD is distinct from
other types of anxiety

1583
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,630
and anxiety-related disorders,

1584
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,420
things like PTSD and
panic disorder, et cetera,

1585
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,970
because the goal again
is to bring the person

1586
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:36,420
right up close to the thing
that they fear the most

1587
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,640
and then to interrupt the circuit.

1588
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,460
And now you should be able to know,

1589
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,580
just intuitively, 'cause you
understand the mechanisms,

1590
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,260
that the circuit you're trying to disrupt

1591
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,350
is the pattern of information flow

1592
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,000
from the thinking part of the brain,

1593
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,020
the perception part of the brain,

1594
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,230
which is the cortex, to the striatum.

1595
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:58,560
The striatum has these
neurons which are active

1596
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,690
that essentially are, I
know it sounds a little bit

1597
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,070
like a discussion about free will,

1598
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,120
but they're trying to get some,

1599
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,950
the person to generate a certain behavior,

1600
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,810
suppress a certain behavior.

1601
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,310
And as anxiety ramps up,

1602
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,730
it's sort of a hydraulic
pressure to do that very thing

1603
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:12,810
that they've done for so long

1604
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,640
and they suffer from so much.

1605
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,650
We talked about hydraulic
pressure in the context

1606
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,780
of aggression in the aggression episode,

1607
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,953
this is very similar.

1608
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,290
There's a kind of a,

1609
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,490
now when I say hydraulic pressure,

1610
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,900
it's not actual hydraulic pressure,

1611
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,940
it's the confluence of a
lot of different systems.

1612
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,620
It's neurochemicals, we'll soon learn,

1613
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,510
it's hormonal, it's electrical,

1614
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,880
it's a lot of different
things operating in parallel

1615
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,460
so we can't point to one
chemical or transmitter.

1616
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,440
What's happening is the
person is feeling compelled

1617
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,660
to act, act, act to relieve the anxiety

1618
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,440
and through a progressive
type of exposure,

1619
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,030
you don't throw people in the deep end

1620
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,520
in this kind of therapy right off the bat,

1621
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,230
you gradually ratchet them toward

1622
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,910
or move them toward the discussion

1623
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,440
of exactly what they fear the most

1624
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,090
and then eventually move them toward

1625
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,250
the interruption of the compulsion

1626
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,770
as they're feeling this
extremely elevated anxiety,

1627
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,940
of course, within the context

1628
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,610
of a supportive clinical setting.

1629
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,340
But in doing that, what
you are teaching people

1630
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,550
is that the anxiety can
exist without the need

1631
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,140
to engage in the compulsion.

1632
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,990
Now some of this might
sound to people like, oh,

1633
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,280
this is a lot of kind of fancy

1634
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,870
psychological neuroscience speak

1635
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:17,400
around something that's kind of intuitive.

1636
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,850
But I think for most people,
this is not intuitive.

1637
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:22,413
And for people with OCD,

1638
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,710
there's no really other way to put it,

1639
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:29,490
the impulse, the
compulsion to avoid anxiety

1640
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,770
is such a powerful driving force

1641
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,060
that it should now make sense to you

1642
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,760
as to why being able to tolerate anxiety

1643
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,160
and really sit with it
and do the exact opposite

1644
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,720
of what you're normally compelled to do

1645
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,490
is going to be the path to treatment.

1646
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:45,030
And indeed CBT has been shown
to be enormously effective,

1647
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:47,880
again for a large number
of people with OCD,

1648
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,990
but not all of them.

1649
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,990
And oftentimes it requires that it also be

1650
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:54,240
used in concert with
certain drug treatments,

1651
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,250
which we're going to
talk about in a moment.

1652
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,620
Next, let's talk about some
of the really unique features

1653
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,810
of cognitive behavioral
therapy and exposure therapy

1654
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:04,350
in the context of OCD
that you often don't see

1655
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:08,280
in the use of CBT, that is
cognitive behavioral therapy,

1656
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,030
for other types of psychiatric
challenges and disorders.

1657
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,390
The first element is one of stair casing.

1658
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,070
And I already mentioned this before,

1659
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:21,000
but this gradual and progressive increase

1660
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,540
in the anxiety that you're
trying to evoke from the patient,

1661
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,000
from the person suffering from OCD.

1662
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,080
That's done in the context of
the office or the laboratory,

1663
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,873
again, by a trained
and licensed clinician.

1664
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,780
But then the person leaves, right?

1665
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,200
They leave the office,
they leave the laboratory.

1666
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,120
And a very vital component

1667
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,940
of CBT and exposure
therapy for people with OCD

1668
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,420
is that they have and perform
what's called homework,

1669
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,160
is literally what they call.

1670
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,990
This might be seen in
other sorts of treatments

1671
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:55,320
but for OCD, homework
is extremely important,

1672
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,850
because within the context

1673
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,740
of a laboratory experiment or the clinic,

1674
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,810
patients often feel so much support

1675
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,400
that they can tolerate
those heightened levels

1676
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,770
of anxiety and interrupt
their compulsions.

1677
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,910
Whereas when they get home,

1678
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,340
oftentimes the familiarity
of the environment

1679
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,930
brings 'em to a place
where all of a sudden

1680
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,150
those obsessions and compulsions start

1681
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,200
interacting the same way

1682
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,650
and they have a very hard time
suppressing the behaviors.

1683
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,730
Why would that be?

1684
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:20,310
Well in neuroscience, we have a phrase,

1685
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,020
it's called conditioned place preference

1686
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,700
and conditioned place avoidance.

1687
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,720
There's some other phrases too

1688
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,310
but basically it all has to do

1689
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:29,130
with a simple thing which is,

1690
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,740
when you feel something
repeatedly in a given environment,

1691
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,960
or sometimes even once
within a given environment,

1692
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,390
you tend to feel that same thing again

1693
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,760
when you return to that
or similar environments.

1694
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,140
Okay, So conditioned place blank,

1695
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:42,990
or conditioned place that
is simply fancy nerd speak

1696
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,970
for the fact that when you're in a place

1697
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,380
and something good happens,

1698
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,090
you tend to feel good if
you return to that place

1699
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,670
or a place like it, or
if something bad happens

1700
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,110
in a given place, you tend to feel bad

1701
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,900
when you return to that
place or a place like it.

1702
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,200
I think that most salient
example that leaps to mind

1703
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,980
is in, unfortunately, the category of bad,

1704
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,460
but I had some friends years
ago visit San Francisco.

1705
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,720
There's been a ongoing,

1706
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,490
it seems like it's been happening forever,

1707
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,750
but this is really in the last decade

1708
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,740
of daytime break-ins and
nighttime break-ins into cars

1709
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,960
to steal anything from computers

1710
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,640
to what seems to be like a box of tissues.

1711
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,470
And there are numerous reasons for this,

1712
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:17,303
I don't want to get into,

1713
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:18,780
it's not the topic of today's podcast,

1714
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,160
but I will use this as
an opportunity to say

1715
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,990
if you're visiting
anywhere in the Bay Area,

1716
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,130
do not leave anything in your car

1717
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,960
because the window will get broken into,

1718
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,400
sometimes in broad daylight.

1719
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,500
Some good friends of mine
were visiting the Bay Area

1720
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,960
and I texted them and said,

1721
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,940
hey, by the way, when you're
headed to dinner, guys,

1722
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,180
make sure you bring in all
your luggage and computers

1723
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,370
however inconvenient that might be.

1724
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,310
They wrote back, too late,
everything got stolen.

1725
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,290
So some years ago now, I
think five, six years ago

1726
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,620
this happened, sadly,
everything got stolen.

1727
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,580
Most of it could be replaced,

1728
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,680
but some of it was very
sentimental to them.

1729
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,710
Every time we talk, every time we consider

1730
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:54,450
having a meeting in a particular city,

1731
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,670
this comes up as I don't want to be there,

1732
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,290
I don't like that city anymore, et cetera.

1733
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,820
And of course, San
Francisco has some wonderful

1734
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,610
redeeming features, but it
only takes one bad incident

1735
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:04,380
in one location to kind of color

1736
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,860
the whole picture dark, so to speak.

1737
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,120
The brain works that way.

1738
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,360
The brain generalizes, it's
not a very specific organ,

1739
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,650
again, it's a prediction machine

1740
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,030
in addition to other things.

1741
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,820
So in the case of CBT therapy,

1742
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,850
the reason there's homework
is that when people go home,

1743
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,460
oftentimes that's when they relapse,

1744
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,480
if you want to call it that,

1745
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,280
back into their obsessions
and compulsions.

1746
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,420
And that location, that conditioned place

1747
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:33,030
is where it becomes most
important to challenge

1748
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,890
the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety,

1749
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,420
to not try and suppress the anxiety

1750
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,880
through compulsions or other means.

1751
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,730
And when I say other means, I
want to highlight something,

1752
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,830
it will come up again a little
bit later in the podcast,

1753
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:47,310
that substance abuse is very
common in people with OCD

1754
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,960
because of the anxiety component

1755
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,790
and also because of people's feelings

1756
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,710
that they just can't
escape from the thoughts

1757
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:57,030
or behavioral patterns that
are so characteristic of OCD.

1758
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,270
So alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse,

1759
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:02,130
or other forms of narcotics abuse

1760
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:05,400
are very common in OCD.

1761
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,960
Later, we'll talk about
whether or not cannabis

1762
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,960
can or cannot help with OCD.

1763
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,880
But needless to say,

1764
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,360
suppressing anxiety is
exactly the wrong direction

1765
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,870
that one should take if
the goal is to ultimately

1766
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:21,510
relieve or eliminate the OCD.

1767
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,260
So we now have two characteristics
of CBT exposure therapy

1768
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,060
that are extremely important for OCD

1769
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,070
and somewhat unique to
the treatment of OCD

1770
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:31,680
and that's the staircasing up
towards the really bad fear,

1771
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,980
the really severe and
specific articulation

1772
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,380
and understanding and
feeling of how bad things

1773
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,690
really would be if someone engaged

1774
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:42,030
in a particular behavior or
avoided a particular behavior.

1775
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,950
Then there's the component of homework

1776
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:47,430
given by the clinician for
the person to be able to

1777
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:49,560
create a broader set of context

1778
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,710
in which they can deal with the anxiety,

1779
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:54,450
not engage in the compulsions.

1780
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:57,720
And then a very unique
feature of treatment of OCD

1781
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,810
that you don't see in many
other psychiatric disorders

1782
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,190
are home visits.

1783
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,660
And I find this fascinating.

1784
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,510
I think that the field of
psychiatry and psychology

1785
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:10,740
traditionally doesn't allow
for or invite home visits,

1786
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:15,060
but this component of
context, location and context

1787
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:19,890
being so vital to the
treatment and relief of OCD

1788
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:23,640
has inspired many
psychiatrists and psychologists

1789
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,130
to get permission to do home visits

1790
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,720
where they actually go
visit their patients

1791
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,240
in their native setting,
in their home cages, right?

1792
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,820
They're not mice, but in
their home-home cages,

1793
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,380
I'm being facetious here, but people,

1794
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,150
mice live in cages, at
least in the laboratory,

1795
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:39,540
and humans generally live
in houses or elsewhere,

1796
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,450
so they visit them in their home

1797
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,610
in order to see how they're interacting

1798
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:46,890
and the particular locations that evoke

1799
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,660
the most anxiety and the least anxiety.

1800
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,580
Some of the, I don't want
to call them crutches,

1801
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,160
but some of the tools
that people are using

1802
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,940
to confront and deal with the
obsessions and compulsions

1803
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,160
and in particular to try and identify

1804
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,980
some of the tools and tricks

1805
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,320
that people are using to try and avoid

1806
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,690
that heightened anxiety,
because, once again,

1807
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,800
and I know I'm repeating myself,

1808
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,170
but I think this is just
so vital and so unique

1809
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,510
about OCD and the treatment of OCD,

1810
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,420
the critical need for the
patient to be able to tolerate

1811
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:20,189
extremely elevated levels
of anxiety is so crucial.

1812
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:23,189
So if people are avoiding
certain rooms in the house,

1813
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:25,979
or if people are avoiding certain foods

1814
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,659
or certain locations in the kitchen,

1815
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,520
the clinician can start to identify that

1816
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,229
by mere observation.

1817
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:33,479
And I should mention here that patients

1818
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,719
are not always aware of
how they're interacting

1819
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,830
with their home environment.

1820
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,683
Some of these patterns are
so deeply ingrained in people

1821
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,810
that they don't even realize that they're

1822
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,130
constantly turning to the left,

1823
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,600
or they don't even realize that

1824
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,790
they're only washing their
hands on one side of the sink.

1825
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,010
And so the clinician,
by visiting the home,

1826
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,580
can start to interrogate
a bit in a polite way,

1827
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,330
in a friendly, in a supportive way

1828
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,600
as to, do you ever think
about why you always

1829
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,160
flip the faucet to the left

1830
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,529
or flip the faucet to
the right, et cetera.

1831
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:05,759
Now, we all do a lot of
things that are habitual.

1832
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,310
We all do things that are

1833
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,109
somewhat regular from day to day.

1834
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:13,109
In fact, I would invite
you to ask yourself,

1835
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:16,529
do you always put your
toothbrush in the same location?

1836
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:18,059
Do you always cap the toothbrush

1837
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,410
before or after you use it?

1838
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,243
What sorts of things do you-

1839
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:23,580
You wipe the little threading
on the toothpaste or not?

1840
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,430
I'm somebody, I confess that I have,

1841
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,770
well, I have about 3,500 pet peeves,

1842
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,670
but one of my pet peeves

1843
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,550
is toothpaste kind of on the
thread of the toothpaste.

1844
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:34,260
It really bothers me, I don't know why,

1845
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,870
almost as much as trying
to wipe it off bothers me,

1846
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,189
which creates a certain challenge.

1847
01:09:38,189 --> 01:09:39,749
And if I talk about this any further,

1848
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,770
then I think I would qualify

1849
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:43,470
for obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

1850
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,640
But I have to say, I don't experience

1851
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,840
a ton of anxiety about it.

1852
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,040
It doesn't govern my life.

1853
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,720
In fact, I realize that right now

1854
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,670
there are tubes of toothpaste

1855
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,200
that have toothpaste along the thread

1856
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,635
everywhere in the world

1857
01:09:53,635 --> 01:09:54,468
and it doesn't really bother me.

1858
01:09:54,468 --> 01:09:57,780
I can still sit here and
provide some information

1859
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,620
about OCD to you.

1860
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:02,250
It's not intrusive, at
least not to my awareness.

1861
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,960
So by the home visit,

1862
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,120
the therapist can really start to explore

1863
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,210
through direct questioning
and can allow the patient

1864
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,460
to explore through direct
questioning of themselves

1865
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:12,810
the things that they might be conscious of

1866
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:15,270
and the things that they
might not be conscious of

1867
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,610
that would qualify for OCD.

1868
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,250
So I'd like to just briefly
summarize the key elements

1869
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,370
of cognitive behavioral
therapy and exposure therapy

1870
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:26,190
and how they can be combined
with drug treatments

1871
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,393
that are very effective.

1872
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,910
Much of what I'm going to talk about next

1873
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:33,540
relates to the data
and indeed the practice

1874
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:38,250
of an incredible research
scientist and clinician.

1875
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,140
So this is Helen Blair Simpson,

1876
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:42,120
or I should say Dr. Helen Blair Simpson,

1877
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,430
because she is indeed an MD medical doctor

1878
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:46,050
and a PhD research scientist

1879
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:49,230
at Columbia University School of Medicine.

1880
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:52,290
And one of the world's foremost experts,

1881
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,780
if not the expert, I would
put her in a category

1882
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,960
of maybe just one to three people who

1883
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,470
is most knowledgeable about
the mechanisms of OCD,

1884
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,740
is actively researching OCD in humans,

1885
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,150
trying to find new treatments,

1886
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:08,760
trying to unveil new mechanisms

1887
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,240
and expand on our current
understanding and who also treats

1888
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,643
OCD quite actively in her own clinic.

1889
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,320
Dr. Simpson gave a beautiful presentation

1890
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,960
which she summarized
some of the core elements

1891
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,730
of CBT and exposure therapy

1892
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,190
for the treatment of
obsessive-compulsive disorders.

1893
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:29,340
She describes that the key
procedures are exposures,

1894
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,070
of course, done in person

1895
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,200
and with the actual thing that evokes

1896
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,450
the obsessions and compulsions.

1897
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,630
So this could be the sweaty
towel as described earlier,

1898
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,380
or could be any number of
different triggers done

1899
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,090
with the patient in real time,

1900
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,100
so in vivo, as we say.

1901
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,250
And it could also be
things that are imaginal,

1902
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,050
sitting somebody down in a chair,

1903
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,340
in an office and saying,

1904
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,950
okay, I want you to imagine the thing

1905
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,360
that triggers the intrusive thought,

1906
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,050
or let's just focus on the
intrusive thought as it arises,

1907
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,180
and then to explore and expose the patient

1908
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,770
to their obsessions and
compulsions that way.

1909
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:06,900
So it can be real, or it can be imaginal.

1910
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,250
And the goal, of course, then

1911
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,920
is to gradually and progressively

1912
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,450
increase the level of anxiety,

1913
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:15,390
but then to intervene in
so-called ritual prevention

1914
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,300
to prevent the person from
engaging in the compulsion.

1915
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,910
The goals, again I'm paraphrasing here,

1916
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:24,330
are to, as she states, disconfirm fears

1917
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,770
and challenge the beliefs
about the obsessions

1918
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:30,960
and compulsions, to
intervene in the thoughts

1919
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,430
and the behaviors, and to break the habit

1920
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,110
of ritualizing and avoiding.

1921
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,460
Now, how is this typically done?

1922
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,490
What are the nuts and
bolts of this procedure?

1923
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,330
Typically, this is done
through two planning sessions

1924
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,163
with the patient.

1925
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:45,450
So describing to the
patient what will happen

1926
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:47,790
and when it will happen
and how long it will happen

1927
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:50,010
so that they're not just thrown into this

1928
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,090
out of the blue.

1929
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:55,710
And then 15 exposure sessions
done twice a week or more.

1930
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,120
So the one thing to really understand

1931
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,500
about cognitive behavioral therapy

1932
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,240
is that it can take some period of time,

1933
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,480
several or more weeks, as
many as 10 or 12 weeks.

1934
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,160
However, as you'll soon learn,

1935
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,900
many of the drug treatments
that are effective

1936
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,750
in treating OCD either
alone or in combination

1937
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:13,440
with behavioral therapies
also can take 8, 10, 12 weeks

1938
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,080
or longer, and many of
those never work at all.

1939
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,760
So even though 10 to 12 weeks

1940
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,140
seems like a long period of time,

1941
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,400
it's actually a pretty standard.

1942
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,590
If you'd like to see
more complete description

1943
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:24,630
of the protocols for
cognitive behavioral therapy

1944
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,730
and exposure therapy for OCD,

1945
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:28,290
I'll provide links to two papers,

1946
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:30,630
Kozak and Foa, F-O-A,

1947
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,310
which is published in 1997,

1948
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:33,600
which might seem like a long time ago,

1949
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,510
but nonetheless, that the
protocols are still very useful.

1950
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:39,000
And then the second paper
is by that last author,

1951
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,800
FOA et al in 2012

1952
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,960
and we'll provide links to both of those.

1953
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,930
In addition, Dr. Blair Simpson and others

1954
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,660
have explored what are the best treatments

1955
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,360
for patients with OCD by comparing

1956
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,270
cognitive behavioral
therapy alone, placebo,

1957
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,060
so essentially no intervention

1958
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,130
or something that takes an
equivalent amount of time

1959
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:03,090
but is not thought to be
effective in treatment.

1960
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:07,380
As well as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

1961
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,721
So what is an SSRI?

1962
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:13,050
An SSRI is a drug that
prevents the re-uptake

1963
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,820
of serotonin at the synapse.

1964
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,653
What are synapses?

1965
01:14:15,653 --> 01:14:17,580
They're the little spaces between neurons

1966
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,530
where neurons communicate with one another

1967
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,680
by vomiting little bits of
chemical into the space,

1968
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,010
the synapse, and then those
chemicals either evoke

1969
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:27,900
or suppress the electrical activity

1970
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,720
of the next neuron across the synapse.

1971
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,580
And in this case, the neurotransmitter,

1972
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:35,010
the chemical that we're
referring to is serotonin.

1973
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:38,670
SSRI, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors

1974
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:43,020
prevent the reuptake of
the chemical that's left,

1975
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,390
in this case, the serotonin
that's left in the synapse.

1976
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:48,150
After that, I call it
vomiting to be dramatic,

1977
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,170
but it's not actually vomiting,

1978
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:52,710
the extrusion of the
chemical into the synapse.

1979
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,800
And as a consequence,
there's more serotonin around

1980
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,720
to have more of an effect over time,

1981
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,690
the net effect being more
serotonergic transmission,

1982
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,670
more serotonin overall.

1983
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,470
So not more serotonin being made,

1984
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:06,870
more serotonin being available for use,

1985
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,670
that's what an SSRI does.

1986
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:13,470
So they compared cognitive
behavioral therapy, SSRIs,

1987
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:14,700
they also had the placebo group

1988
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,200
and they had cognitive behavioral therapy

1989
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,950
plus the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.

1990
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,710
This was a 12-week study
done as described before,

1991
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:25,380
two times a week over
the course of 12 weeks.

1992
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,380
First of all, the most
important thing, of course,

1993
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,520
placebo did nothing.

1994
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,520
It did not relieve the OCD
to any significant degree.

1995
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,693
How did they know that?

1996
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:36,960
They gave them the Y-BOCS test

1997
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,590
that we talked about
before, the Yale-Brown test

1998
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,960
with all those questions
of which I read a few.

1999
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,560
So the OCD severity that one has to have

2000
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,230
on the Y-BOCS is measured
in terms of an index

2001
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:52,860
that goes from here from
8 all the way up to 28,

2002
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,990
that shouldn't mean anything.

2003
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,890
So that number eight is
kind of meaningless here.

2004
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:58,290
It's in terms of an index
that's only meaningful

2005
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:01,350
for the Y-BOCS, but if
somebody has a threshold

2006
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:04,110
of 16 or higher, it means
that they're still having

2007
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,430
somewhat debilitating symptoms

2008
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,170
or very debilitating symptoms.

2009
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:10,410
Placebo did not reduce the
obsessions or compulsions

2010
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:12,270
to any significant degree.

2011
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:14,490
However, and I think quite excitingly,

2012
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:17,680
cognitive behavioral
therapy had a dramatic

2013
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:22,320
effect in reducing the
obsessions and compulsions

2014
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,010
such that by four weeks, that
score that, in this case,

2015
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:27,270
ranged from 8 to 28,

2016
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:31,380
dropped all the way from
25 down to about 11.

2017
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,190
So it's a huge drop in the
severity of the symptoms.

2018
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,600
Now, what's really interesting

2019
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,480
is that when you look
at the effects of SSRIs

2020
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,900
in the treatment of OCD symptoms,

2021
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,960
they had a significant effect
in reducing the symptoms

2022
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,780
of OCD that showed up first at four weeks,

2023
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,300
and then continued to eight weeks.

2024
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,450
In fact, there was a progressive
and further reduction

2025
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,120
in OCD symptoms from the
four to eight week period.

2026
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,970
Again, these are the people
just taking the SSRI,

2027
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:01,650
and then it sort of
flattened out a little bit,

2028
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,090
such that by 12 weeks,

2029
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,760
there was still a significant
reduction in OCD symptoms

2030
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,000
for people taking SSRIs
as compared to placebo.

2031
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,400
But the severity of their symptoms

2032
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,010
was still much greater than those

2033
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:16,590
receiving cognitive
behavioral therapy alone.

2034
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,150
So at least in this study,

2035
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:19,680
and I should tell you which study it is,

2036
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,990
this is Foa, Liebowitz et al 2005

2037
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:23,400
in the American Journal of Psychiatry,

2038
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,810
we'll also provide a link to this

2039
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,060
so you can peruse the data if you like.

2040
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,440
But at least in this study,

2041
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,350
cognitive behavioral therapy
was the most effective,

2042
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:35,130
selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, less effective.

2043
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,720
So what happens when you combine them?

2044
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,130
Well, they explored that as well,

2045
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,253
and the combination of
cognitive behavioral therapy

2046
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:42,810
and the SSRIs together

2047
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:47,463
did not lead to any further
decrease in OCD symptoms.

2048
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,480
This points to the idea that
cognitive behavioral therapy

2049
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,830
is the most effective treatment.

2050
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:54,540
And again, when I say
cognitive behavioral therapy,

2051
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,520
now I'm still referring
to cognitive behavioral,

2052
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,770
slash, exposure therapy done in the way

2053
01:17:58,770 --> 01:17:59,610
that I detailed before,

2054
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,950
twice a week for 12 weeks or more.

2055
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,690
So all of the data, at
least in this study,

2056
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:05,880
point to the fact that
cognitive behavioral therapy

2057
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,430
is really effective
and the most effective.

2058
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:11,910
Does it alleviate OCD
symptoms for everybody?

2059
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,743
No.

2060
01:18:12,743 --> 01:18:13,920
Is it very time consuming? Yes.

2061
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,730
Twice a week for two sessions
or more of 15 minutes,

2062
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,800
sometimes in the office,
plus there's homework,

2063
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,290
plus, in an ideal case,
there's also home visits

2064
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:24,240
from the psychiatrist or psychologist,

2065
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:28,530
that's a lot of investment,
a lot of time investment,

2066
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:31,590
to say nothing of the
potential financial investment.

2067
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,350
Now, Dr. Blair Simpson has
given some beautiful talks

2068
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:37,290
where she describes these data

2069
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:39,750
and also emphasizes the fact that

2070
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,300
despite the demonstrated power

2071
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,150
of cognitive behavioral therapy
for the treatment of OCD,

2072
01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:46,620
most people are given drug treatments

2073
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:49,050
simply because of the availability
of those drug treatments.

2074
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,083
Now, when I say most people,

2075
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,720
I want to emphasize that I'm referring

2076
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,750
to most people who
actually go seek treatment

2077
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:56,820
because a really
important thing to realize

2078
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,710
is that most people with OCD

2079
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:01,920
do not actually go seek
evidence-based treatment.

2080
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,720
I want to repeat that,
most people with OCD

2081
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,580
do not seek evidence-based treatment,

2082
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,870
which is a tragic thing.

2083
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:09,570
One of the motivations for
doing this podcast episode

2084
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,160
is to try and encourage people

2085
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,200
who think they may have
persistent obsessions

2086
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,110
and compulsions to seek treatment,

2087
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:19,770
but most people don't
for a variety of reasons

2088
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,680
we spelled out earlier, shame, et cetera.

2089
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,350
Of those that do, the first line of attack

2090
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:29,370
is typically a prescription,
most often an SSRI,

2091
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:31,350
although not always just SSRIs

2092
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:35,460
because soon we'll talk
about the somewhat common use

2093
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,110
of also prescribing a
low dose of a neuroleptic

2094
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,570
or an antipsychotic, not always but often.

2095
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,790
So the important thing to understand here

2096
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:47,580
is that excellent
researchers like Dr. Simpson

2097
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,920
understand that while there are treatments

2098
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,800
that we could say are best or are ideal

2099
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,840
based on the data, that
doesn't necessarily mean

2100
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,730
that's what's being deployed

2101
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:58,650
most often in the general public.

2102
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:01,470
As a consequence, Dr. Simpson and others

2103
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:04,530
have explored in a very practical way

2104
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:07,140
whether or not it matters if somebody

2105
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,870
is getting SSRI treatment

2106
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:14,280
and is experiencing that
reduction in OCD symptoms

2107
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,160
that as you may recall, is more than

2108
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,950
what they would experience
with placebo alone,

2109
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,400
but not as dramatic a
reduction in OCD symptoms

2110
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,050
as they would get with
cognitive behavioral therapy.

2111
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,540
And as I mentioned before,
there was this exploration

2112
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,160
of combining drug treatment

2113
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,470
with cognitive behavioral
therapy from the outset,

2114
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:34,170
but they also quite impressively explored

2115
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,290
what happens when people
who are already taking SSRIs

2116
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,510
initiate cognitive behavioral therapy.

2117
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,040
This is a really wonderful thing

2118
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,740
that they've done this
because in doing that,

2119
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,420
first of all, they're acknowledging that

2120
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,250
there are many people out
there who have sought treatment

2121
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:49,800
and are getting some
relief from those SSRIs,

2122
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,590
but it perhaps is not as much
relief as they could get.

2123
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:56,340
And they are actively
acknowledging that many people

2124
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,290
are getting these drug treatments first.

2125
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,610
In fact, most often people are getting

2126
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,260
these drug treatments first.

2127
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,330
So what happens when you add in

2128
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,620
cognitive behavioral therapy?

2129
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:05,910
Well, the good news is when you add

2130
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:07,980
cognitive behavioral therapy

2131
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,830
to someone who's already taking SSRIs,

2132
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:13,200
that further improves their symptoms.

2133
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,320
Now that's different than the results

2134
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,150
that I described before

2135
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,490
from the same laboratory in fact,

2136
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,520
that if you combine
cognitive behavioral therapy

2137
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,620
with SSRIs from the outset,

2138
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,293
there's no additional benefit of SSRI.

2139
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,840
However, as I just described,

2140
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,060
if someone is already taking an SSRI

2141
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,380
and they're experiencing a
reduction in their OCD symptoms,

2142
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,110
by adding in cognitive behavioral therapy,

2143
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:44,624
there is a further reduction
in the symptoms of OCD.

2144
01:21:44,624 --> 01:21:45,457
This is very important.

2145
01:21:45,457 --> 01:21:46,800
So for those of you that
have sought treatment

2146
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,010
and you're taking a SSRI,

2147
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,460
or if you're thinking about treatment

2148
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:52,080
and you're prescribed an SSRI,

2149
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,520
the ideal scenario really would be

2150
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,020
to combine the drug treatment

2151
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,460
with cognitive behavioral therapy,

2152
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,830
or in some cases, maybe cognitive
behavioral therapy alone,

2153
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,960
although that's a decision
that you really have to make

2154
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,170
with the close

2155
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,690
advice and oversight of
a licensed physician,

2156
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,700
because, of course, these
are prescription drugs.

2157
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,680
And anytime you're going to add or remove

2158
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,210
a prescription drug or change dosage,

2159
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,657
you really want to do that
in close discussion with

2160
01:22:14,657 --> 01:22:16,590
and on the advice of your physician.

2161
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:17,700
I don't just say that to protect me,

2162
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,067
I say that to protect you

2163
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,640
'cause it's just the right thing to do.

2164
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,650
So again, cognitive behavioral therapy

2165
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,880
is extremely powerful.

2166
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,070
Drug treatments seem less powerful though.

2167
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,360
If you're already on a drug treatment,

2168
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,670
adding cognitive behavioral
therapy can really help.

2169
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,020
So I've been talking about SSRIs

2170
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,550
and described a little
bit about how they work

2171
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,650
at a kind of superficial level of

2172
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,600
keeping more serotonin in the synapse

2173
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,570
so that more serotonin can be in action

2174
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,570
as opposed to gobbled
back up by those neurons.

2175
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,470
I should just mention what some

2176
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:46,230
of the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors are.

2177
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:48,633
So things like clomipramine,

2178
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,740
which is not entirely selective,

2179
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,870
I should say that that one generally falls

2180
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,610
into a category of less selective.

2181
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:59,130
So it can impair

2182
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,630
or can enhance some of
the other neurotransmitter

2183
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:05,850
or neuromodulator systems
like epinephrine, et cetera.

2184
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:09,420
The selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors are,

2185
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,910
at least the classic ones
are, fluoxetine, Prozac,

2186
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:15,600
fluvoxamine, Luvox,
paroxetine, sertraline,

2187
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,643
citalopram, et cetera, et cetera.

2188
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,900
There are about six or classic SSRIs,

2189
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,430
some of them like citalopram

2190
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:26,370
are used in children and are available

2191
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:27,870
in pediatric doses.

2192
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:30,660
Some like Prozac may or may
not be used in children.

2193
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,720
The details of which SSRIs, et cetera,

2194
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,180
is a very extensive
literature and discussion.

2195
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,090
And I think it's safe to say that

2196
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,430
which drugs to use and which dosage

2197
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:44,100
and whether or not to continue, excuse me,

2198
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,320
the same dosage over time depends a lot

2199
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,930
on the individual variation
that people express

2200
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:50,490
and the responses that they have.

2201
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,710
All of these drugs, in
fact, I think we can say

2202
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,930
all drugs have side effects.

2203
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:58,590
The question is how detrimental
those side effects are

2204
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,423
to daily life.

2205
01:23:59,423 --> 01:24:02,400
The SSRIs are well known to
have effects on appetite.

2206
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,920
In some cases, they abolish appetite.

2207
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,960
In some cases, they just
reduce it a little bit.

2208
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,120
In some cases, they increase appetite.

2209
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,770
Really is highly individual.

2210
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,360
They can have effects on libido.

2211
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,703
For instance, they can reduce sex drive,

2212
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,160
sometimes in a dose dependent way,

2213
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,380
sometimes in a way that's
more like a step function

2214
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,110
where people are fine at
say 5 or 10 milligrams,

2215
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:25,020
but then they get to 15 milligrams

2216
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,933
and there's a cliff for their libido.

2217
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,540
That can happen, it really depends.

2218
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,700
Please don't take those
dosages as exact values

2219
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,800
'cause this is going to depend on

2220
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,620
what they're being used for,
depression or anxiety or OCD,

2221
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,450
and it's also going to depend
on the drug, et cetera.

2222
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:41,634
I just threw out those numbers as a way

2223
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:43,470
to illustrate what a
kind of a step function

2224
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:44,303
would look like.

2225
01:24:44,303 --> 01:24:46,200
It's not gradual, it's
immediate at a given dose

2226
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,700
is what that means.

2227
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,880
The other thing is that
some of these drugs

2228
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,920
will have transient effects.

2229
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,750
So side effects that show
up and then disappear

2230
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,240
or sadly people will
sometimes take these drugs

2231
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,130
for a while and then side
effects will surface later

2232
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,900
that weren't there previously

2233
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,060
depending on life factors,
nutrition factors.

2234
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,850
So it's a very complicated
landscape overall.

2235
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,500
And that's why it's really
important to explore

2236
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,990
any kind of drug treatment,
SSRI or otherwise,

2237
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,330
really in close communication
with a psychiatrist

2238
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:14,190
who really understands
the pharmacokinetics

2239
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:15,630
and has a lot of patient history

2240
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:17,130
and experience with them.

2241
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:18,390
So what I'm about to tell you next

2242
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:20,790
is most certainly going
to come as a big surprise,

2243
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,920
which is that despite the fact

2244
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,960
that the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors

2245
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,720
can be effective in reducing
the symptoms of OCD,

2246
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,250
at least somewhat,

2247
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,290
and certainly more than placebo,

2248
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,810
there is very little, if any evidence,

2249
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,840
that the serotonin system
is disrupted in OCD.

2250
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,670
And I have to point out that this is

2251
01:25:38,670 --> 01:25:42,300
a somewhat consistent theme
in the field of psychiatry,

2252
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,330
that is a given drug can be very effective

2253
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:48,540
or even partially effective
in reducing symptoms

2254
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,880
or in changing the overall landscape

2255
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,640
of a psychiatric disorder or illness,

2256
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,100
and yet there is very little,

2257
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,050
if any evidence, that
that particular system

2258
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:02,550
is what's causal for OCD, or anxiety,

2259
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,810
or depression, et cetera.

2260
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,460
This is just the landscape
that we're living in

2261
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,990
in terms of our understanding of the brain

2262
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:09,720
and psychiatry and the ways
of treating brain disorders.

2263
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,510
So as a consequence,
there are a huge number

2264
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:15,720
of academic reviews that
clinicians and research scientists

2265
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,493
have generated and read and share.

2266
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:22,440
One of the more, I think, thorough ones

2267
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,780
in recent years was published in 2021.

2268
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,710
I'll provide a link to this.

2269
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:29,130
This is by an excellent,
truly excellent researcher

2270
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:31,260
from Yale university School of Medicine,

2271
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,490
I should say not just a researcher

2272
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:35,010
but a clinician scientist,
again, an MD-PhD.

2273
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,170
This is Christopher Pittenger

2274
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:38,190
And the title of the review

2275
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:41,970
is Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies

2276
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,430
and New Targets in OCD.

2277
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,740
And again, we'll provide a link to it.

2278
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:49,680
This is a just gorgeous review describing,

2279
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,480
as I just told you, that
the serotonin system

2280
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,370
isn't really disrupted in OCD

2281
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:56,040
and yet SSRIs can be very effective.

2282
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:00,120
The review goes on to explore
even what sorts of receptors

2283
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,830
for serotonin might be involved.

2284
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:05,070
If it's in fact the case that serotonin

2285
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:10,070
is a culprit in the
creation of OCD symptoms.

2286
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,830
Talk about the serotonin 2A receptor

2287
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,180
and the serotonin 1A receptor.

2288
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,800
Why am I mentioning all that detail?

2289
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,270
If in fact it's not clear,

2290
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,250
serotonin is involved because

2291
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,840
I'll just tell you right now,

2292
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,190
there is currently a lot of interest

2293
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:25,320
in whether or not some
of the psychedelics,

2294
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,077
in particular psilocybin, can be effective

2295
01:27:27,077 --> 01:27:29,520
in the treatment of OCD.

2296
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,580
Psilocybin has been shown
in various clinical trials

2297
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,050
in particular the clinical trials done

2298
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,880
at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine

2299
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,650
by Matthew Johnson and others.

2300
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,420
Matthew was on The Huberman Lab Podcast.

2301
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,040
He's been on the Tim Ferris podcast.

2302
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,990
He's been on the Lex Fridman podcast.

2303
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:44,280
He's a world class researcher

2304
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,560
on the use of psychedelics for depression

2305
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,500
and other psychiatric challenges.

2306
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,720
And their psilocybin treatment

2307
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,610
has been seen, at least in those trials,

2308
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:55,110
to be very effective in the treatment

2309
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:56,960
of certain kinds of major depression.

2310
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,210
Currently the exploration of psilocybin

2311
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:02,100
for the treatment of OCD

2312
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,750
has not yielded similar results,

2313
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,460
although the studies are ongoing.

2314
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,530
Again, has not yielded
similar effectiveness,

2315
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:09,120
but the studies are ongoing

2316
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,070
And the serotonin 2A receptor

2317
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,750
and the serotonin 1A receptors

2318
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:16,440
are primary targets for
the drug psilocybin.

2319
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,880
So I figured there were
going to be some questions

2320
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,790
about whether or not
psychedelics help with OCD,

2321
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,040
thus far it's inconclusive.

2322
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,470
If any of you have been
part of clinical trials

2323
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:28,590
or have knowledge or intuition
about this relationship

2324
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:30,090
or potential relationship, I should say,

2325
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,920
between psilocybin and other psychedelics

2326
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,930
in OCD, please put them
in the comment section.

2327
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,973
We'd love to love to hear from you.

2328
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,640
One thing I should point out

2329
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,560
is that even though serotonin

2330
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,050
has not been directly implicated in OCD,

2331
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:45,720
serotonin and the general
systems of serotonin,

2332
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,550
the circuits in the brain
that carry serotonin

2333
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:49,980
and depend on it have been shown

2334
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:53,910
to impact cognitive
flexibility and inflexibility,

2335
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:56,100
which are kind of hallmark themes of OCD.

2336
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,130
So in animals that have
their serotonin depleted

2337
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:01,950
or in humans that have very
low levels of serotonin,

2338
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:05,880
you can see evidence of
cognitive inflexibility,

2339
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,040
challenges in tasks, switching challenges

2340
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,830
and switching the rules by
which one performs a game,

2341
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:14,940
challenges in any kind of
cognitive domain switching.

2342
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,340
And so that does indirectly implicate

2343
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,100
serotonin in some of the aspects of OCD.

2344
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,810
Again, when one starts to explore

2345
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,310
the different transmitter systems

2346
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:26,070
that have been explored in
animal models and in humans,

2347
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,810
it's a vast, vast landscape,

2348
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,900
but serotonergic drugs do seem to be

2349
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,970
the most effective drugs in treating OCD

2350
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,970
despite the fact, again, despite the fact

2351
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,230
that there's no direct evidence

2352
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:42,120
that serotonin systems
are the problem in OCD.

2353
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,180
If you recall the
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop

2354
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:48,930
that is so central to the etiology,

2355
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:52,500
the presence and the
patterns of symptoms in OCD,

2356
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,660
of course, serotonin is
impacting that system.

2357
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:57,390
Serotonin is impacting just
about every system in the brain,

2358
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,190
but there's no evidence that

2359
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,630
tinkering with serotonin levels,

2360
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:02,820
specifically in that network,

2361
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:06,540
is what's leading to
the improvements in OCD.

2362
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:10,260
However, if people go into a FMRI scanner

2363
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,580
and those people have OCD

2364
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,410
and they evoke the
obsessions and compulsions,

2365
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:17,430
you see activity in that
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop.

2366
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:21,900
Treatments like SSRIs that
reduce the symptoms of OCD

2367
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,600
equate to a situation where
there is less activity

2368
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,130
in that loop.

2369
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:29,220
And I should point out
cognitive behavioral therapy,

2370
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,900
which we have no reason to believe

2371
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,580
only taps into the serotonin system,

2372
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,800
I think it would be extreme stretch,

2373
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,636
it would be false actually to say

2374
01:30:36,636 --> 01:30:38,070
that that cognitive
behavioral therapy taps

2375
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:39,630
only into the serotonin system,

2376
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:41,700
clearly it's going to affect
a huge number of circuits

2377
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,050
in neurochemical systems.

2378
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,660
Well, people who do
cognitive behavioral therapy

2379
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,550
and find some relief for OCD,

2380
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,080
they also show reductions

2381
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,840
in those cortico-striatal-thalamic loops.

2382
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,250
So basically we have a situation

2383
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:56,040
where we have a behavioral
therapy that works,

2384
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,870
in many people, not all,

2385
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,100
and we have a pretty good understanding

2386
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,120
of about why it works.

2387
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,950
It increases anxiety tolerance,

2388
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:06,950
and interference with pattern execution,

2389
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,820
getting people to not engage

2390
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,350
in the same sorts of behaviors

2391
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:12,180
that are detrimental to them.

2392
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,280
And we have drug treatments that work

2393
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,240
at least to some degree,

2394
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,500
but we don't know how they work

2395
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,850
or where they work in the brain.

2396
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:20,010
One of the things that really unifies

2397
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,400
the behavioral treatments
and the drug treatments

2398
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,440
is that they take some period of time.

2399
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,330
Some relief from symptoms seems to show up

2400
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:29,880
around four weeks and
certainly by eight weeks

2401
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:33,210
for both cognitive behavioral
therapy and the SSRIs,

2402
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:36,390
but it's really at the 10 to 12 week stage

2403
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,040
when someone's been
doing these twice a week,

2404
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,990
cognitive behavioral sessions,

2405
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:43,650
where they've been taking
a SSRI for 10 to 12 weeks,

2406
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:45,810
that the really significant reduction

2407
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:49,170
in OCD symptoms starts to really show up.

2408
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,150
Now, up until now, I've
been talking about the fact

2409
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:54,000
that people are getting
relief from these treatments,

2410
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,710
but sadly,

2411
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,300
in the case of OCD,

2412
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:00,540
there is a significant population

2413
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:03,780
that simply does not respond to CBT

2414
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:06,600
or to SSRIs, or to their combination,

2415
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,560
which is why psychiatrists
also explore the combination

2416
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,470
of SSRIs and neuroleptics

2417
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:16,170
or drugs that tap into the
so-called dopamine system

2418
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:17,430
or the glutamate system.

2419
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:20,040
These are other neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators

2420
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,810
that impact different
circuits in the brain.

2421
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,070
And just to really remind you

2422
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,170
what neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators do,

2423
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,110
because this is important
to contextualize all this,

2424
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,990
neurotransmitters are
typically involved in the

2425
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:32,820
rapid communication between neurons.

2426
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,830
And the two most common
neurotransmitters for that

2427
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:37,200
are the neurotransmitter glutamate,

2428
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,818
which we say is excitatory,

2429
01:32:38,818 --> 01:32:40,311
meaning when it's
released into the synapse,

2430
01:32:40,311 --> 01:32:43,849
it causes the next neuron to
be more active, or active,

2431
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:46,099
and GABA which is a neurotransmitter

2432
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:47,791
that is inhibitory,
meaning when it's released

2433
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:49,590
into the synapse, typically, not always,

2434
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:52,320
but typically, that GABA
is going to encourage

2435
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,510
the next neuron to be
less electrically active

2436
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:56,133
or even silence its activity.

2437
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:59,820
The neuromodulators, by contrast,

2438
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,980
So not neurotransmitters,
but neuromodulators

2439
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,960
like dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine,

2440
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,770
and acetylcholine and others

2441
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,490
operate a little bit differently.

2442
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:10,620
They tend to act a
little bit more broadly.

2443
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:12,330
They can act within the synapse,

2444
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:15,180
but they can also change
the general patterns

2445
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:16,410
of activity in the brain,

2446
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:18,270
making certain circuits more likely

2447
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:21,420
to be active and other circuits
less likely to be active.

2448
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,730
So when we say dopamine does X

2449
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:25,770
or dopamine does Y, or serotonin does X

2450
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:26,603
or serotonin does Y,

2451
01:33:26,603 --> 01:33:28,140
they don't really do one thing,

2452
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:30,570
they change the sort of overall tonality.

2453
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:32,100
They make it more likely or less likely

2454
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,840
that certain circuits will be active.

2455
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,510
You can think of them as
kind of activating playlists

2456
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,540
or genres of activity in the brain,

2457
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,360
rather than being involved
in the specific communication

2458
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,220
or specific songs, if you will,

2459
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:47,430
in this analogy, or discussions
between particular neurons.

2460
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:51,540
So when we hear that
SSRIs increase serotonin

2461
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,430
and reduce the symptoms of OCD,

2462
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:56,490
or a neuroleptic reduces
the amount of dopamine

2463
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:59,790
and makes people feel calmer for instance,

2464
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:04,790
or can remove some stereotype,
repetitive motor behavior,

2465
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:06,840
which they can either generate

2466
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,450
or reduce motor behavior it turns out.

2467
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:11,240
So when I say that, what I'm referring to

2468
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,960
is the fact that these neuromodulators

2469
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,810
are kind of turning up the
volume on certain circuits

2470
01:34:15,810 --> 01:34:18,540
and turning down the
volume on other circuits.

2471
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:22,080
I say that because if
you are going to explore

2472
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:25,440
drug treatments again
with a licensed physician,

2473
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:28,380
if you're going to explore
drug treatments for OCD,

2474
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,830
and in particular, if you
are not getting results

2475
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:34,440
from SSRIs, or you're not getting results

2476
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,670
from cognitive behavioral therapy

2477
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,590
or the side effect profiles of the drugs

2478
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:39,750
that you're taking for OCD

2479
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:43,110
are causing problems that
you don't want to take them,

2480
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:45,000
well, then it's important to understand

2481
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,130
that anytime you take one of these drugs,

2482
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,810
they're not acting specifically

2483
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:51,510
on the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit.

2484
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,343
That would be wonderful.

2485
01:34:52,343 --> 01:34:54,300
That's the future of psychiatry,

2486
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,360
but as now, when you take a drug,

2487
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,350
it acts systemically.

2488
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:00,600
So it's impacting serotonin in your gut.

2489
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,790
It's also impacting serotonin
in other areas of the brain,

2490
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:07,790
hence the effects on things
like digestion or libido or

2491
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,000
any number of different things

2492
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,890
that serotonin is involved in.

2493
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:14,070
Likewise, if you take a
neuroleptic like haloperidol

2494
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:17,580
or something that reduces
dopamine transmission,

2495
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,410
well, then it's going to
have some motor effects

2496
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:21,420
'cause dopamine is
involved in the generation

2497
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,700
of motor sequences and
smooth limb movement.

2498
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,810
That's why people with Parkinson's

2499
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:27,060
who don't have much dopamine
will get a resting tremor,

2500
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,620
have a hard time
generating smooth movement.

2501
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:31,080
And so the side effects
start to make sense,

2502
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:33,660
given the huge number of
different neural circuits

2503
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,000
that these different
neuromodulators are involved in.

2504
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,010
I don't say that to be discouraging,

2505
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,620
I say that to encourage patients

2506
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:43,050
and careful systematic exploration

2507
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:45,570
of different drug treatments for OCD

2508
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:49,920
always again with the careful and close

2509
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,080
guidance and oversight of a psychiatrist

2510
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,700
because psychiatrists really understand

2511
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,190
which side effect profiles make it likely

2512
01:35:56,190 --> 01:36:00,510
that you can or cannot or will never,

2513
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:02,610
or maybe someday will be
able to take a given drug

2514
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:03,630
at a given dose.

2515
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,310
They're the ones that
really have that knowledge.

2516
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,780
This is not the sort
of thing that you want

2517
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,570
to cowboy and go try
and figure out yourself.

2518
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:11,670
Now, I also want to acknowledge

2519
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,530
that there are other
forms of drug treatments.

2520
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:15,150
We touched on psilocybin briefly,

2521
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:16,890
but there are other
forms of drug treatments

2522
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:19,260
that have been explored for OCD.

2523
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,240
Earlier, we talked a
little bit about cannabis.

2524
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:25,680
Why would cannabis be a
place of exploration at all?

2525
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,640
Well, first of all,

2526
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:29,610
a number of people try
and self medicate for OCD.

2527
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:31,380
There is some clinical evidence,

2528
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,760
I'm not talking about recreational use,

2529
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:33,780
I'm talking about clinical evidence

2530
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,640
that cannabis can reduce anxiety.

2531
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:37,590
Now earlier we were talking about

2532
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:41,070
not reducing anxiety, but
learning anxiety tolerance

2533
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:44,160
in order to deal with and treat OCD

2534
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,863
in the context of cognitive
behavioral therapies.

2535
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:49,530
That doesn't necessarily rule out cannabis

2536
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:52,707
as a candidate for the treatment of OCD.

2537
01:36:52,707 --> 01:36:54,660
And in fact, this has been explored.

2538
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:59,250
A study from Dr. Blair Simpson
herself looked at this.

2539
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,960
This was a fairly small scale study.

2540
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,280
So first of all, I'll give you the title.

2541
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,390
And again, we'll provide a link.

2542
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:05,520
This is entitled, Acute
effects of cannabinoids

2543
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,620
on symptoms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder:

2544
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,450
A human laboratory study.

2545
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:12,120
very briefly, this was 14 adults with OCD.

2546
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:14,430
They had prior experience with cannabis.

2547
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:16,590
This was randomized, placebo-controlled.

2548
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:20,640
The cannabis was smoked,
they had different varietals,

2549
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,540
as they're called.

2550
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,440
They had a placebo.

2551
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,820
So this is basically a condition
in which certain subjects

2552
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:30,270
consumed a cigarette that had 0% THC,

2553
01:37:30,270 --> 01:37:33,730
others had 7% THC,
other groups that is, or

2554
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,980
some had 0.4% CBD and THC.

2555
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:39,060
So they looked at CBD.

2556
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,953
I know a lot of people out
there are interested in CBD.

2557
01:37:40,953 --> 01:37:42,690
This is one of the few
studies I could find

2558
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:45,150
where they explored different percentages

2559
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:47,170
of THC and CBD in these

2560
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:51,000
cannabis or marijuana
cigarettes basically.

2561
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,920
The total amount that they consumed,

2562
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,660
I believe, was 800 milligrams.

2563
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,730
These, again, are not suggestions.

2564
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:58,710
These are just simply
reporting what's in this study.

2565
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:00,510
You can, again, I'll provide a link.

2566
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:04,740
They looked at OCD symptoms, ratings.

2567
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,870
They looked at cardiovascular effects.

2568
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:08,550
They had a large number
of different things

2569
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,510
that they explored.

2570
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:11,760
And I should say this
study was done in 2020,

2571
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,090
and it was the first
placebo-controlled investigation

2572
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:18,120
of cannabis in adults with
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

2573
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,200
Pretty interesting.

2574
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,600
And I'm just reading from
their conclusions here.

2575
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,310
The data suggests that smoked cannabis,

2576
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:26,520
whether containing primarily THC or CBD,

2577
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,020
remember they looked at
different concentrations

2578
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:30,330
of those, has little acute impact,

2579
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:32,680
meaning immediate impact on OCD symptoms

2580
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:35,850
and yield smaller reductions in anxiety

2581
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:37,170
compared to placebo.

2582
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:40,440
So they did not see a, when
I say a positive effect,

2583
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:43,230
I mean a ameliorative effect,

2584
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,690
an effect in reducing symptoms of OCD

2585
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:47,670
from cannabis or CBD,

2586
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:49,740
which, it's unfortunate.

2587
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:51,600
I think it's unfortunate anytime
a treatment doesn't work.

2588
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,890
But nonetheless, those are the data,

2589
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:54,540
I'm sure there are going
to be other studies.

2590
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,710
I'm sure there are also going to be people

2591
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:57,570
in the YouTube comments section saying

2592
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:01,620
that cannabis and CBD
helps their OCD symptoms,

2593
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:04,050
at least I anticipate there probably will.

2594
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:05,160
Almost everything I say here,

2595
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,720
somebody will contradict it with something

2596
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,940
from their experience, which
I encourage, by the way.

2597
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:11,310
I want to hear about your
experience with certain things

2598
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,400
even if it's not from randomized
placebo-controlled studies,

2599
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,870
I still find it very interesting

2600
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:18,270
to know what people are doing
and what they're experiencing.

2601
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:20,490
I think that's one of the
better uses of social media

2602
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:22,650
comment sections, is to be
able to share some of that,

2603
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:25,260
not in an advice-giving
way or prescriptive way,

2604
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,420
but simply as a way to share and encourage

2605
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,070
different types of exploration.

2606
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,360
There are other sorts of drug treatments

2607
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:32,970
that are gaining popularity for OCD,

2608
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:34,740
at least in the research realm.

2609
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:38,220
One treatment that is a legal, L-E-G-A-L.

2610
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:39,180
Sometimes when I say legal,

2611
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,610
sometimes people think I say
illegal, but that is legal,

2612
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:45,870
at least by prescription in
the United States, is ketamine.

2613
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,380
The actions of ketamine
are somewhat complex

2614
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,550
although we know, for instance,

2615
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:52,710
that ketamine acts on
the glutamate system,

2616
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:56,430
it tends to disrupt the transmission

2617
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:58,530
or the relationship, I should say,

2618
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:01,230
between glutamate, not glutamine,

2619
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:04,290
not the amino acid, but
glutamate, the neurotransmitter,

2620
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:07,890
and the so-called NMDA, the
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,

2621
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:10,590
which is a receptor that's very special

2622
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:12,720
in the nervous system
because when glutamate binds

2623
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:16,230
to the NMDA receptor, it tends to

2624
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:18,420
offer the opportunity for
that particular synapse

2625
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,640
to get stronger, so-called neuroplasticity

2626
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,420
and ketamine is a,
essentially, an antagonist,

2627
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,400
although it works through
a complicated mechanism,

2628
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,440
it tends to block that

2629
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,470
binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor

2630
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:32,670
or the effectiveness of that.

2631
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:35,670
Ketamine therapy is now
being used quite extensively

2632
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:37,530
for the treatment of
trauma and for depression.

2633
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:39,540
It leads to a dissociative state.

2634
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,800
It's a so-called dissociative analgesic

2635
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:44,670
in the variety of ways
in which that happens.

2636
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:45,960
We did an episode on depression.

2637
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,870
We're going to do another entire
episode all about ketamine

2638
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:51,240
describing the networks that
ketamine impacts, et cetera.

2639
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:54,060
Ketamine therapies are
being explored for OCD.

2640
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:57,660
As of now, the data
look somewhat promising,

2641
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:00,540
but there's still a lot more
work that needs to be done.

2642
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,640
My read of the data are that

2643
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,370
the more extensive clinical trials

2644
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:06,420
have not happened yet.

2645
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,300
The smaller studies that have happened

2646
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,400
revealed that some
patients do get some relief

2647
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,500
from ketamine therapy for OCD,

2648
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,400
but there was nothing
overwhelmingly pointing to the fact

2649
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,570
that ketamine is a magic
bullet for OCD treatment.

2650
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:24,420
So cannabis, CBD, at least now,

2651
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:26,580
even though it's one smaller study,

2652
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,160
there's no real evidence that it can

2653
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,843
alleviate OCD symptoms.

2654
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,270
If there are new studies published soon,

2655
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:34,620
I'll be sure to update you.

2656
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:35,730
And if you see those studies,

2657
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:36,563
please send them to me.

2658
01:41:36,563 --> 01:41:38,910
Ketamine therapy, the jury is still out,

2659
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:40,860
psilocybin, The jury is still out.

2660
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,450
These are early days.

2661
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:45,420
Another treatment that's
becoming somewhat common,

2662
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,700
or at least people are
commonly excited about

2663
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,010
is transcranial magnetic stimulation.

2664
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:52,320
So this is the use of a magnetic coil.

2665
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,910
This is completely noninvasive,

2666
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:57,030
placed on one portion of the skull,

2667
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:59,920
and one can direct magnetic

2668
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:03,150
energy toward particular
areas of the brain

2669
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,950
to either suppress, or nowadays,

2670
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:07,440
you can also activate
particular brain regions.

2671
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,490
There are some interesting data

2672
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:10,470
showing that if TMS is applied

2673
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:11,940
to areas of the brain involved

2674
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,010
in the generation of motor action,

2675
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:15,750
so the so-called motor areas,

2676
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,600
or supplementary motor
areas as they're called,

2677
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:23,190
while people think about
or have intrusive thoughts,

2678
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,650
we know that the TMS coil can interrupt

2679
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:29,130
the motor behaviors, the
compulsive behaviors,

2680
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:31,600
and at least in a small cohort of studies

2681
01:42:32,536 --> 01:42:35,130
and a small number of
patients within those studies,

2682
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:37,380
this has been shown to be effective,

2683
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:39,450
not just while the coil
is on the head, of course,

2684
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:41,970
but after the study has been performed

2685
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,500
or the treatment's been performed

2686
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:47,850
in reducing OCD symptoms
by disrupting the tendency

2687
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:51,570
for the compulsive behavior
to be so automatic.

2688
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:54,810
One of the key features of
obsessive-compulsive disorder

2689
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:58,650
is that, especially if it's
been around for a while,

2690
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:00,360
the person's been dealing
with it for a while,

2691
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:03,420
there isn't a pattern in
which the person thinks,

2692
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,970
oh, I have this contamination fear,

2693
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:08,370
or I need symmetry, or
I'm kind of obsessed

2694
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:09,720
to count to the number seven.

2695
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,433
And then they pause and they go,

2696
01:43:11,433 --> 01:43:12,900
ooh, and then they do it.

2697
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,660
No, typically there's a very close

2698
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:18,570
pairing of the obsession
and the compulsion in time

2699
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:19,950
so that somebody's
walking down the street,

2700
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:21,180
thinking one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

2701
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,310
one, two, three, four,
five, six seven, seven...

2702
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:24,870
and then they're doing this

2703
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:27,150
in such rapid succession

2704
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:29,430
because the obsessions
are coming up so quickly.

2705
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:31,680
Thoughts can be generated very quickly.

2706
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:32,943
And then they're
generating the compulsions

2707
01:43:32,943 --> 01:43:34,320
as a way to beat down

2708
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,690
or to try and suppress that anxiety

2709
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:38,100
and then it comes right back up again

2710
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,410
at even stronger as I described earlier.

2711
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:42,480
So transcranial magnetic stimulation

2712
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,093
seems to intervene in these
various fast processes.

2713
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:48,300
Right now, I don't think it's fair to say

2714
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,820
that TMS is a magic bullet either.

2715
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:52,470
I think there's a lot
of excitement about TMS

2716
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,940
and in particular,

2717
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,890
I really want to nail this point home,

2718
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:58,590
in particular, there's excitement about

2719
01:43:58,590 --> 01:44:01,800
the combination of TMS
with drug treatments,

2720
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,880
or the combination of TMS with
cognitive behavioral therapy.

2721
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,470
And this is a really important point,

2722
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:08,700
not just for sake of discussion

2723
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:10,230
about obsessive-compulsive disorder,

2724
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:14,760
but also depression, ADHD, schizophrenia,

2725
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:17,760
any number of different
psychiatric challenges

2726
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,480
and disorders in most cases
are going to respond best

2727
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,280
to a combination of behavioral treatment

2728
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,410
that's ongoing that
occurs in the laboratory

2729
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:26,243
and clinical setting,

2730
01:44:26,243 --> 01:44:28,740
but also in the home setting
where there's homework,

2731
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,943
maybe even home visits.

2732
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:33,690
Drug treatments, often, not always,

2733
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:35,220
are a terrific augment to

2734
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,620
those cognitive behavioral therapies

2735
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:38,040
or other behavioral therapies.

2736
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,050
And then now we are living in the age

2737
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:41,310
of brain-machine interface.

2738
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:43,020
You have companies like Neuralink

2739
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:45,630
that I think it's fair
to say are going to enter

2740
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:48,210
the brain machine-interface world first

2741
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:51,960
through the treatment
of certain syndromes,

2742
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,940
movement syndromes or
psychiatric syndromes

2743
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:56,160
probably before they
start putting electrodes

2744
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,650
into the brain to
stimulate enhanced memory

2745
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:00,060
or enhanced cognition, who knows,

2746
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,830
I don't know exactly what they're doing

2747
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:02,937
behind the walls of Neuralink.

2748
01:45:02,937 --> 01:45:04,560
But I have to imagine, in fact,

2749
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,810
I would wager maybe not both arms,

2750
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:08,340
but I'll wager my left arm

2751
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:13,340
that the first set of
FDA approved technologies

2752
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,960
to come out of companies like Neuralink

2753
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:17,400
are going to be those for
the treatment of things

2754
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,200
like Parkinson's and movement disorders

2755
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,630
and cognitive disorders, rather than,

2756
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:24,030
shall we say, kind of recreational

2757
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:26,100
cognitive enhancement
or things of that sort.

2758
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,530
So transcranial magnetic
stimulation is noninvasive.

2759
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:30,900
It doesn't involve going
down below the skull,

2760
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:33,690
can have some effect,
but most laboratories

2761
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:36,210
that I'm aware of at
Stanford and elsewhere

2762
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:38,400
that are exploring TMS for things like OCD

2763
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,530
and other types of psychiatric

2764
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:43,830
challenges are using TMS in combination

2765
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:45,660
with drug therapies, are using,

2766
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:46,980
in some cases, for instance,

2767
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,710
a laboratory at Stanford, hope
to get 'em on the podcast,

2768
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:51,780
a psychiatrist, Nolan Williams,

2769
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:54,180
is exploring TMS in combination with

2770
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:56,370
psychedelic therapies, not
necessarily at the same time,

2771
01:45:56,370 --> 01:45:57,890
but nonetheless combining them

2772
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:00,510
or exploring how they
impact brain circuitry.

2773
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:03,240
So if you have OCD, should
you run out and get TMS,

2774
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,920
or should you try ketamine therapy,

2775
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,420
of course, with a licensed physician?

2776
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,490
I think it's too early to say yes.

2777
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:11,400
I think the answer is
we need to wait and see.

2778
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,527
I think cognitive behavioral
therapy, the SSRIs,

2779
01:46:13,527 --> 01:46:16,470
and some other drug
treatments like neuroleptics

2780
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:19,410
combined with SSRIs and
cognitive behavioral therapy

2781
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:22,530
are where the real bulk of the data are.

2782
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:25,170
I want to make one additional
point about cannabis CBD

2783
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:27,840
as it relates to
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

2784
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,210
To me, it's not at all surprising

2785
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:34,350
that cannabis CBD did not
improve symptoms of OCD.

2786
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:36,690
Because in my discussion
with Dr. Paul Conti

2787
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,310
a few weeks ago,

2788
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:39,480
and I should mention, Dr. Conti

2789
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,673
is indeed a medical
doctor, a psychiatrist,

2790
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,270
we were talking about
cannabis and its various uses,

2791
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:48,270
because it does have some
clinical applications.

2792
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,820
And he mentioned that
one of the main effects

2793
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:54,630
of cannabis is to tighten focus

2794
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:57,660
and to enhance concentration on

2795
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:00,450
and thoughts about one particular thing.

2796
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:03,120
And in some cases that can
be clinically beneficial,

2797
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:06,120
and in other cases that can
be clinically detrimental.

2798
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:11,120
If you accept the idea that
cannabis increases focus,

2799
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:15,870
and you think about OCD
and the networks involved,

2800
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:18,180
and you think about the
anxiety and the relationship

2801
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:20,880
between the obsession and compulsion,

2802
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,680
well, then it shouldn't
come as any surprise

2803
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:26,130
that cannabis did not
improve the symptoms of OCD

2804
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:29,040
because if anything,
it would increase focus

2805
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,870
on the obsessions and the compulsions.

2806
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:31,950
Now that's not what they observed.

2807
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,960
They did not see an exacerbation

2808
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,380
or a worsening of the
symptoms of OCD with cannabis,

2809
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,120
at least that's not my read of the data,

2810
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,100
but they did not see an improvement

2811
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:44,130
in OCD symptoms with cannabis or CBD.

2812
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:46,110
And to me, that's not surprising

2813
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:49,560
given that cannabis CBD
seems to increase focus.

2814
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,630
Next, I'd like to talk
about some of the research

2815
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:55,110
on and the roles of hormones in OCD,

2816
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:55,943
because it turns out to be

2817
01:47:55,943 --> 01:47:57,870
a very interesting relationship there.

2818
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,580
But before I do, I want
to point out something

2819
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,490
that I realize I probably
should have said earlier,

2820
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:05,610
which is one of the key
things for someone with OCD

2821
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:08,190
to come to understand if
they're going to experience

2822
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,810
any relief of their symptoms,

2823
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:10,980
whether or not they're
doing drug treatments

2824
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:12,990
or behavioral treatments or otherwise,

2825
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:17,613
is that thoughts are
not as bad as actions.

2826
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,760
Thoughts are not as bad as actions.

2827
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,090
One of the kind of rules
that people with OCD

2828
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:26,160
seem to adopt for themselves

2829
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,530
is that thoughts are really,

2830
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:30,330
truly the equivalent of actions.

2831
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:32,580
So they'll have an intrusive thought and,

2832
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,990
we haven't spent too
much time on this today,

2833
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:35,970
but earlier I touched on the fact

2834
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:38,280
that some of the intrusive
thoughts that people have

2835
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:40,470
in OCD are really disturbing.

2836
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:42,180
They can be really gross,

2837
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:44,100
or at least gross to that person.

2838
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:49,050
They can evoke imagery that
is toxic or infectious,

2839
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,630
or is highly sexualized in a way

2840
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:54,480
that is disturbing to
them, it can be very taboo.

2841
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,130
This is not uncommon

2842
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:57,780
when you start talking to people with OCD

2843
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,490
and you start pulling on the thread.

2844
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:01,470
Again, this would be a psychiatrist

2845
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:03,630
who was trained to ask the right questions

2846
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:05,910
and gain the comfort
and trust of a patient.

2847
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:06,743
And they start to reveal that

2848
01:49:06,743 --> 01:49:09,630
these thoughts are really
intrusive and kind of disturbing,

2849
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:11,220
which is why they feel so compelled

2850
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:13,380
to try and suppress them with behaviors.

2851
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:17,280
One of the powerful elements
of treatment for OCD

2852
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,490
is to really support the patient

2853
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:24,210
and make them realize that
thoughts are just thoughts

2854
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:26,550
and that everyone has disturbing thoughts.

2855
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:28,380
And that oftentimes
those disturbing thoughts

2856
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:31,440
arise at the most
inconvenient, and sometimes,

2857
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,010
what seems like the most
inappropriate circumstances.

2858
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:37,350
And this relates to a
whole larger discussion

2859
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:39,780
that we could have about what are thoughts

2860
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:40,620
and why do they surface,

2861
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:43,530
and how come when you stand
at the edge of a bridge,

2862
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:45,210
even if you do not want to jump off,

2863
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:46,680
you think about jumping off.

2864
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:48,450
And this has to do with the fact

2865
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:50,850
that your nervous system,
as a prediction machine,

2866
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:52,710
is oftentimes testing possibilities.

2867
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:56,050
And sometimes that testing
goes way off into the

2868
01:49:56,910 --> 01:50:00,540
Netherlands of the thought patterns

2869
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:03,360
and emotional patterns that
we all have inside of us.

2870
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,850
The big difference between
a thought and an action

2871
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:08,870
is that, of course, the nervous system is,

2872
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:11,100
in one case, not translating

2873
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:14,043
those patterns of thinking
into motor sequences.

2874
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:18,660
That nerdy way of saying
thoughts aren't actions,

2875
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:19,493
believe it or not,

2876
01:50:19,493 --> 01:50:21,480
can be helpful for people if they really

2877
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,730
think about that and
use it as an opportunity

2878
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:27,360
to realize that, first of
all, they're not crazy.

2879
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,300
They're not thinking
and feeling this stuff

2880
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,190
because they're bad or evil.

2881
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:34,200
And of course, sometimes
this can cross over

2882
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,820
with other elements of life

2883
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:37,800
where we place moral judgment on people

2884
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,633
for certain behaviors.

2885
01:50:38,633 --> 01:50:40,680
I think that's part of a
healthy society, of course,

2886
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,630
that's why we have laws and punishments

2887
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:45,690
and rewards for that matter
for certain types of behaviors.

2888
01:50:45,690 --> 01:50:47,730
But this idea that thoughts
are not as bad as actions

2889
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:49,770
and that thoughts can be tolerated

2890
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:51,660
and the anxiety around thoughts

2891
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:54,060
can be tolerated and
over time can diminish,

2892
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:56,310
that's a very powerful hallmark theme

2893
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:57,450
of the treatment of OCD

2894
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,940
so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention it.

2895
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,920
Thoughts are not actions.

2896
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,530
Actions can harm us, they
can harm other people,

2897
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:08,520
they can soak up enormous amounts of time.

2898
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,920
Thoughts can soak up
enormous amounts of time.

2899
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,940
They can be very troubling.

2900
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,200
They can be very detrimental.

2901
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,810
We of course want to be sensitive to that,

2902
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:18,810
but when it really comes down to it,

2903
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:22,830
the first step in treatment
for OCD is this realization

2904
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:24,510
where the approach to the realization

2905
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:27,300
that thoughts are not as bad as actions.

2906
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:29,550
So what about hormones in OCD?

2907
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:30,750
Well, this has been explored,

2908
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:33,660
albeit not as extensively
as I would've liked to find,

2909
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,340
but when I went into the literature,

2910
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:38,280
I found one particularly
interesting study,

2911
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:40,230
entitled, Neurosteroid Levels in Patients

2912
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:42,180
with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

2913
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,013
First author, Erbay

2914
01:51:43,013 --> 01:51:45,377
And as always, we'll
provide a link to the study.

2915
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,560
The objective of this
study was to explore serum

2916
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:53,730
within blood, neurosteroid
levels in people with OCD.

2917
01:51:53,730 --> 01:51:54,563
Why?

2918
01:51:54,563 --> 01:51:55,860
Well, because of the relationship

2919
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,360
between OCD and anxiety

2920
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,670
and the fact that in
stress-related disorders

2921
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:01,263
such as anxiety and depression,

2922
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,140
the hormones have been
extensively explored,

2923
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,780
but not so much in OCD,
at least until this study.

2924
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,090
So they compared serum levels of a number

2925
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:11,580
of different hormones,
progesterone, pregnenolone,

2926
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:15,360
DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.

2927
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,297
This was done in 30 patients with OCD

2928
01:52:17,297 --> 01:52:19,620
and 30 healthy controls.

2929
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:22,620
So it's not a huge study,
but it's enough to draw

2930
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:24,000
some pretty nice conclusions.

2931
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,910
These subjects were 18 to 49 years old,

2932
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:30,330
and the controls were age and sex matched

2933
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:31,200
healthy volunteers.

2934
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,850
Again, no OCD.

2935
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:34,260
What was the basic
takeaway from the study?

2936
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:36,900
The basic takeaway from the
study was that in females

2937
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:39,630
with OCD, there was evidence

2938
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:43,650
for significantly elevated
cortisol and DHEA.

2939
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:45,330
Now that's interesting because cortisol

2940
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:48,570
is well known to be associated
with the stress system.

2941
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:50,670
Although every day, should mention,

2942
01:52:50,670 --> 01:52:54,300
we all, male or female,
everybody experiences

2943
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,790
an increase in cortisol
shortly after awakening.

2944
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:59,040
That's a healthy increase in cortisol.

2945
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:03,150
Late shift, I mean, late in
the day peaks in cortisol

2946
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:04,950
where a shift in that cortisol peak

2947
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:09,330
to later in the day is a known correlate

2948
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:11,583
of depression and anxiety disorders.

2949
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:14,157
So the fact that cortisol is elevated

2950
01:53:14,157 --> 01:53:18,420
and DHEA are elevated in female patients

2951
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:20,200
with OCD suggests that

2952
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:24,480
cortisol is either reflective of or causal

2953
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,820
for the increase in anxiety.

2954
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,920
We don't know the
direction of that effect.

2955
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:31,680
Now in male patients with OCD,

2956
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,810
there was evidence for increased cortisol.

2957
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:36,860
Again, not surprising given the
role of anxiety in cortisol,

2958
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:39,930
or I should say, given the
role of cortisol in anxiety

2959
01:53:39,930 --> 01:53:42,870
and the increasing anxiety seen in OCD,

2960
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:45,990
but there are also significant
reductions in testosterone,

2961
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:48,180
which should also not surprise us

2962
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:52,020
because cortisol and
testosterone more or less compete

2963
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,990
in some fashion for their own production,

2964
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:57,900
both are derived from
the molecule cholesterol.

2965
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,670
And there are certain biochemical pathways

2966
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:01,860
that can either direct
that cholesterol molecule

2967
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:05,220
toward cortisol synthesis
or testosterone synthesis,

2968
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:06,540
but not both.

2969
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,373
So they compete.

2970
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:09,060
So when cortisol goes up in general,

2971
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:10,200
not always, but in general,

2972
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,570
testosterone goes down and vice versa.

2973
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:14,310
If you want to learn more
about the relationship

2974
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:15,810
between cortisol and testosterone,

2975
01:54:15,810 --> 01:54:17,850
and there are even some tools
to try and optimize those

2976
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,400
ratios in both males and females,

2977
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,690
you can find that in our episode

2978
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:23,730
on optimizing testosterone and estrogen,

2979
01:54:23,730 --> 01:54:25,800
that's at hubermanlab.com.

2980
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,440
Now, I would say the
most interesting aspect

2981
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,800
of this study is not
that DHEA and cortisol

2982
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,200
are elevated in females with OCD

2983
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,670
or that cortisol and testosterone

2984
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:36,630
have this opposite effect,

2985
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:40,110
cortisol up and testosterone
down in males with OCD,

2986
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:43,080
but rather the relationship
between all of those,

2987
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:45,573
DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone.

2988
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:49,350
In terms of GABA, GABA again

2989
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:51,570
being this inhibitory neurotransmitter

2990
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:56,040
that tends to quiet
certain neuronal pathways,

2991
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:58,830
it does different things
at different synapses,

2992
01:54:58,830 --> 01:55:01,170
but in general, the more
GABA that's present,

2993
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:02,790
the more inhibition that's present,

2994
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:05,520
and therefore the more
suppression of neural activity.

2995
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,520
And DHEA is known to
be a potent antagonist

2996
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:13,470
of the GABA system.

2997
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:18,470
So here we have elevated DHEA in females.

2998
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:21,090
And I should also
mention that testosterone

2999
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:23,820
is also known to tap into the GABA system.

3000
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:26,130
Typically, when testosterone is elevated,

3001
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,760
GABA transmission, at
least is slightly elevated.

3002
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,280
So here we have a situation
in which the pattern

3003
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:36,510
of hormones in females and males with OCD

3004
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:40,770
are different from those
in people without OCD

3005
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:43,860
such that GABA transmission is altered

3006
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:47,640
and the net effect would be
an overall reduction in GABA.

3007
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,390
Now GABA, as an inhibitory
neurotransmitter,

3008
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:53,670
and broadly speaking is associated

3009
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:55,770
with lower levels of anxiety,

3010
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:57,750
and it tends to create balance

3011
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:59,430
within various neural circuits.

3012
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:00,630
Now, that's a very broad statement,

3013
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:03,540
but we know for instance, in epilepsy,

3014
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,010
that GABA levels are reduced

3015
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:06,990
and therefore you get runaway excitation

3016
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:08,340
of certain circuits in the brain,

3017
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:10,740
and therefore seizures, either petite mal,

3018
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,350
mini seizures, or grand
mal, massive seizures,

3019
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:15,690
or even drop seizures where
people completely collapse

3020
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:16,830
to the floor in seizure.

3021
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,180
You may have seen this before.

3022
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,950
I certainly have, it's very dramatic

3023
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:23,010
and it actually is quite
debilitating for people

3024
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:24,660
because obviously they don't
know when these seizures

3025
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:27,030
are coming on most often, and then

3026
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:29,910
they can fall into a stove
or while driving, et cetera.

3027
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:33,180
So the situation with OCD is one in which,

3028
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:36,393
for whatever reason, we don't
know the direction of effect.

3029
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:39,510
Certain hormones are elevated in females

3030
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:41,280
and certain hormones are elevated in males

3031
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,570
and those hormones differ
between males and females,

3032
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:48,090
and yet they both funnel into a system

3033
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:51,210
where GABAergic or GABA
transmission in the brain

3034
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:53,460
is reduced because of this ability

3035
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:54,900
for those particular hormones

3036
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:57,210
to be antagonists to GABA,

3037
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:01,770
and as a consequence, there's
likely to be overall levels

3038
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:05,400
of increased excitation in
certain networks in the brain

3039
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,972
and that brings us back to this

3040
01:57:07,972 --> 01:57:09,840
cortico-striatal-thalamic loop,

3041
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:12,390
this repetitive loop
that seems to reinforce,

3042
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:16,560
we can say reinforces
obsession, leads to anxiety,

3043
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,400
leads to compulsion, leads to
transient relief of anxiety,

3044
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:24,090
but then increase in anxiety,
increased obsession, anxiety,

3045
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:26,280
compulsion, anxiety,
compulsion, anxiety, compulsion,

3046
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:27,780
and so on and so forth.

3047
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:32,070
So I have not found
studies that have explored

3048
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:34,380
adjusting testosterone levels

3049
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,090
through exogenous administration,

3050
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:37,650
cream or injection or otherwise,

3051
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:42,240
or that have focused on
reducing DHEA in females.

3052
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:43,830
If anyone is aware of such studies,

3053
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:46,860
please put them in the
comment section on YouTube

3054
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:47,850
or send them to us.

3055
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:50,640
We have a contact site on the
website at hubermanlab.com,

3056
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:53,280
but the comment section
on YouTube would be best.

3057
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,220
But because we know that
hormones impact neuromodulators

3058
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,050
and neurotransmitters,
as I just described,

3059
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:00,120
and that those neuromodulators
and neurotransmitters

3060
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,220
play an intimate role in the generation

3061
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:05,340
and the treatment of things like OCD,

3062
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:08,340
it stands to reason that manipulations

3063
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,560
of those hormone systems, however subtle

3064
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,900
or dramatic might, I want to highlight,

3065
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:16,230
might prove useful in
adjusting the symptoms of OCD

3066
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:19,230
and I hope that this is
an area that researchers

3067
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:20,940
are going to pursue in
the very near future

3068
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:24,570
because many of the
treatments for reducing DHEA

3069
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:27,090
or increasing testosterone
or reducing cortisol

3070
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:29,910
have already made it through FDA approval.

3071
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:32,400
They're out there, they're
readily prescribed.

3072
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,020
Many of them are already in generic form

3073
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:36,420
which means that the
patents have already lapsed

3074
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:39,210
on the first versions of those drugs.

3075
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:42,030
So when they're available as
generic drugs, very often,

3076
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:44,700
they're available at
significantly lower cost.

3077
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,050
There's a whole discussion we had there

3078
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:49,470
about patent laws and prescription drugs.

3079
01:58:49,470 --> 01:58:52,140
But because these drugs
are largely available

3080
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:55,740
in prescription yet generic form,

3081
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,060
I think there's a great opportunity

3082
01:58:57,060 --> 01:59:00,600
to explore how hormones,
not just cortisol,

3083
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,770
testosterone, and DHA,

3084
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:04,140
but the huge category of hormones

3085
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:06,510
might impact the symptoms of OCD,

3086
01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:09,210
especially since many
of the symptoms of OCD

3087
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:11,250
show up right around the time of puberty.

3088
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,690
We haven't talked a lot
about childhood OCD,

3089
01:59:12,690 --> 01:59:14,700
'cause we're going to do an entire series

3090
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:18,160
on childhood psychiatric
disorders and challenges but

3091
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:22,380
many children develop OCD early as young

3092
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:24,270
as three or four, believe it or not,

3093
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:26,040
or even 6 or 7 and 10

3094
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,860
and in adolescence, and
certainly around puberty.

3095
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:30,540
and in young adulthood.

3096
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:32,580
It is rare, although it does happen,

3097
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,980
that people will develop
OCD very late in life

3098
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:37,740
around 40 or older, just
kind of spontaneously.

3099
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:39,600
Most often when you look
at their clinical history,

3100
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,580
you find that either they were hiding it

3101
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,320
or is being suppressed in some way,

3102
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:46,140
or if it does spontaneously
show up late in life

3103
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:49,083
like mid-thirties or in one's forties,

3104
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:52,530
typically there's a
traumatic brain injury,

3105
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:55,260
could be due to stroke or
physical injury to the head

3106
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,150
or something of that sort.

3107
01:59:57,150 --> 01:59:58,740
Nonetheless,

3108
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:00,630
there is a interesting correlation

3109
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:03,330
between the onset of puberty
in certain forms of OCD.

3110
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:05,400
There's certain forms of, or I should say,

3111
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:06,840
there's certain aspects of menopause

3112
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,160
that can relate to OCD.

3113
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,260
You can find all these
things in the literature.

3114
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:13,170
All this to say that hormones
impact neurotransmitters

3115
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:15,060
and neuromodulators, which clearly impact

3116
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:17,220
the kinds of circuits
that are involved in OCD

3117
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,140
and it makes sense that,

3118
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:21,630
and I would hope that there
would be an exploration

3119
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:23,400
of how these hormones impact OCD

3120
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,750
in the not too distant future.

3121
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:26,580
Now there is an extensive
literature exploring

3122
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:27,960
how testosterone therapy,

3123
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,430
both in males and
females, can be effective

3124
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:34,440
in some cases in the treatment

3125
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:36,570
of anxiety-related disorders,

3126
02:00:36,570 --> 02:00:40,140
but not, at least to my
knowledge, in OCD in particular.

3127
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:42,330
So this whole area of the use

3128
02:00:42,330 --> 02:00:44,280
of testosterone and estrogen therapies,

3129
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,290
DHEA, cortisol suppression,

3130
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:49,890
or maybe even enhancement
for the treatment of OCD

3131
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:52,350
is essentially a big black box

3132
02:00:52,350 --> 02:00:56,550
that very soon, I believe, will be lit.

3133
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:58,920
I realize that a number of
listeners of this podcast

3134
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:02,580
are probably interested in the non-typical

3135
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:04,713
or holistic treatments for OCD.

3136
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:07,920
Dr. Blair Simpson's lab
has at least one study

3137
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,400
exploring the role of
mindfulness meditation

3138
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:14,310
for the treatment of OCD.

3139
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:17,340
There, the data are a
little bit complicated

3140
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,060
and I should mention that

3141
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:22,680
good things are happening, at
least in the United States,

3142
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,060
probably elsewhere as well,

3143
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:26,430
but good things are happening in terms of

3144
02:01:26,430 --> 02:01:29,100
the exploration of things like meditation

3145
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,140
and other, let's call them non-traditional

3146
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:34,680
or holistic forms of treatment
for psychiatric disorders

3147
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:37,230
because of the division
of complimentary health

3148
02:01:37,230 --> 02:01:38,370
that's now been launched

3149
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:39,630
by the National Institutes of Health.

3150
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:42,690
So, whereas before
people would think about

3151
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:44,970
meditation or yoga nidra,

3152
02:01:44,970 --> 02:01:48,690
or even CBD supplementation
for that matter,

3153
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:50,910
as kind of fringe maybe, or kind of woo

3154
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:53,670
or non-traditional at the very least,

3155
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:55,680
the National Institutes of
Health in the United States

3156
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:59,250
has now devoted an entire division,

3157
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:02,400
an entire Institute,
purely for the exploration

3158
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,740
of things like breathing
practices, meditation, et cetera.

3159
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:06,150
So there's a cancer institute,

3160
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:07,860
there's a hearing and deafness institute,

3161
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:09,570
there's a vision institute,

3162
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:11,580
and now there's this
complimentary health Institute,

3163
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:14,610
which I think is a wonderful addition

3164
02:02:14,610 --> 02:02:18,000
to the more traditional
aspects of medicine.

3165
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,090
I think no possible useful treatment

3166
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:23,700
should be overlooked or
unresearched in my opinion,

3167
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:25,830
provided that can be done safely.

3168
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:28,650
And as I mentioned,
Dr. Blair Simpson's lab

3169
02:02:28,650 --> 02:02:31,347
has looked at the role
of mindfulness meditation

3170
02:02:31,347 --> 02:02:33,330
and the treatment of OCD.

3171
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:36,120
Now we should all keep in mind,

3172
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:38,400
no pun intended, that most of the data

3173
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,970
on mindfulness meditation
shows that it increases

3174
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:43,860
the ability to focus.

3175
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:46,440
Now, this brings us back to a
kind of repeating theme today,

3176
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:48,060
which is that increased focus

3177
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,770
may not be the best thing
for somebody with OCD

3178
02:02:51,870 --> 02:02:55,200
because it might increase
focus on the obsession

3179
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:57,030
and/or compulsion.

3180
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:59,700
Turns out that mindfulness
meditation can be useful

3181
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:00,990
in the treatment of OCD,

3182
02:03:00,990 --> 02:03:04,050
but mainly by way of how it impacts

3183
02:03:04,050 --> 02:03:07,110
the focus on and the ability

3184
02:03:07,110 --> 02:03:10,050
to engage in cognitive
behavioral therapies.

3185
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:13,290
So it's very unlikely, at
least by my read of the data,

3186
02:03:13,290 --> 02:03:15,540
to be a direct effect of meditation

3187
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:16,680
on relieving the symptoms,

3188
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:19,530
rather it seems that
meditation is increasing focus

3189
02:03:19,530 --> 02:03:23,040
on things like cognitive
behavioral therapy homework

3190
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,720
and to not focus on other things

3191
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:28,110
and therefore indirectly
improving the symptoms of OCD.

3192
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,940
Now somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,

3193
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:32,640
there have also been a fairly
large number of studies

3194
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:36,480
exploring how nutraceuticals,
as they're sometimes called,

3195
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,640
supplements that are
available over the counter

3196
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:41,730
can impact the treatment of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

3197
02:03:41,730 --> 02:03:45,000
Now there's such an extensive
number of different compounds

3198
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,310
and supplements that
fall under the category

3199
02:03:47,310 --> 02:03:49,290
of nutraceuticals and
that have been explored

3200
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:51,120
in the treatment of OCD
that I'd like to point you

3201
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:53,670
to a review that is entitled,

3202
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:54,960
Nutraceuticals in the treatment

3203
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,690
of obsessive-compulsive
disorder: a review,

3204
02:03:57,690 --> 02:04:00,510
excuse me, of mechanistic
and clinical evidence.

3205
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:04,500
So it's published in 2011,
so it's over 10-years-old.

3206
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:05,953
And so by now,

3207
02:04:05,953 --> 02:04:08,460
I have to imagine that
there are an enormous number

3208
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:11,430
of additional substances
that could be explored,

3209
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:14,400
but there are just one or two
here that I want to focus on.

3210
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,233
Here in this review,

3211
02:04:15,233 --> 02:04:18,990
they describe effects
of 5-HTP and tryptophan,

3212
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:21,060
so things that are in
the serotonin pathway,

3213
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,893
which would make sense

3214
02:04:21,893 --> 02:04:23,910
given what we know about the SSRIs

3215
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:26,040
that people would explore
how different supplements

3216
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:28,290
that increase serotonergic transmission

3217
02:04:28,290 --> 02:04:30,360
might impact OCD.

3218
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:33,000
What you find is that they
do have significant effects

3219
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,720
in improving or reducing
the symptoms of OCD

3220
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:39,450
in somewhat similar way
to some of the SSRIs.

3221
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:41,313
But you of course have to be careful.

3222
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:44,550
Anything that's going to tap into a given

3223
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:46,860
neurochemical system to the same degree

3224
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:50,160
may very likely have the
same sorts of side effects

3225
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:51,660
that a prescription drug would.

3226
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:53,240
One compound that I like to focus on

3227
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:54,750
in a little more depth, however,

3228
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,450
because it's exciting
and interesting to me

3229
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:59,280
is inositol.

3230
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,410
Inositol is a compound that
we are going to talk about

3231
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:03,750
in several future podcasts, because,

3232
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:05,070
well, first of all,

3233
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:07,440
it seems that it can
have impressive effects

3234
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,030
on reducing anxiety.

3235
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:10,590
It also can have pretty impressive effects

3236
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:13,380
in improving fertility
and particular in women

3237
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,870
with polycystic ovarian syndrome.

3238
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:18,570
And here I'm referring
specifically to myo-inositol

3239
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:20,160
because it comes in several forms.

3240
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:23,790
And it does appear that
900 milligrams of inositol

3241
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:26,970
can improve sleep and can reduce anxiety

3242
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:30,240
perhaps when taken at that
dosage or higher dosages.

3243
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,270
I will just confess, first
of all, I don't have OCD,

3244
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:35,520
although I will also confess
that when I was a child,

3245
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,200
I had a transient tick.

3246
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:39,120
I've talked about this on podcast before.

3247
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,140
It was a grunting tick.

3248
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:41,490
So when I was about six or seven,

3249
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:44,760
I recall a trip to
Washington DC with my family,

3250
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:48,690
where I was feeling a strong

3251
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:51,510
desire or need even as I recall,

3252
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:53,790
to grunt in order to clear something

3253
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:56,190
in my throat, but I didn't
have anything in my throat.

3254
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:58,110
I didn't have a cold
or any postnasal drip,

3255
02:05:58,110 --> 02:06:00,120
it was really just the feeling
that I needed to do that,

3256
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:02,370
to release some sort of tension.

3257
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:05,100
And I remember my dad at the time

3258
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,240
telling me don't do that.

3259
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:07,920
Don't do that, it's not good to grunt

3260
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,753
or something like that.

3261
02:06:08,753 --> 02:06:11,160
I think he saw that it was a
kind of compulsive behavior.

3262
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:12,900
And so I would actually
hide in the back seat

3263
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:15,330
of the rental car and do
it, or I'd hide in my room.

3264
02:06:15,330 --> 02:06:17,040
Fortunately for me, it was transient,

3265
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,710
I think about six months or
a year later, it disappeared.

3266
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:22,800
Although I did notice, actually
an ex-girlfriend of mine

3267
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,540
point out that when I get very tired

3268
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:26,070
and I've been working very long hours,

3269
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:28,620
sometimes that grunting
tick will reappear.

3270
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,460
What does that mean?

3271
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:30,360
Do I have Tourette's?

3272
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:31,560
I don't know, maybe.

3273
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,790
I was never diagnosed with Tourette's.

3274
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:35,460
Do I have OCD? Maybe.

3275
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,780
I certainly could be accused

3276
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:39,360
of having obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,

3277
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,420
which we'll talk about
still in a few minutes.

3278
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:45,240
But the point here is that many children

3279
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:48,690
transiently express ticks
or low level Tourette's

3280
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:50,700
or OCD, and again, transiently

3281
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:52,680
and it disappears over time.

3282
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:54,840
So inositol has been explored

3283
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:56,280
in a bunch of different contexts,

3284
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,923
including for ticks in OCD, et cetera.

3285
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:03,330
Going back to inositol
and its current use,

3286
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:04,380
or I should say my current use,

3287
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:07,260
I've been taking 900
milligrams of inositol

3288
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:10,710
as in addition to my
existing toolkit for sleep,

3289
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:13,290
which I've talked about
many times on this podcast

3290
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:15,030
and other podcasts, consists

3291
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:18,300
of magnesium threonate,
apigenin, and theanine.

3292
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:19,710
If you want to know more about that kit,

3293
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:21,880
you can go to our newsletter,
Neural Network Newsletter

3294
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:23,610
at hubermanlab.com.

3295
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:24,840
The toolkit for sleep is there.

3296
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:26,520
You don't even have to
sign up for the newsletter

3297
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:27,930
but it'll give you a flavor
of the sorts of things

3298
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,070
that are in the newsletter.

3299
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:33,000
In any case, I've been experimenting a bit

3300
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,550
with taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol

3301
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:37,650
either alone or combination
with that sleep kit.

3302
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:39,090
And I must say the sleep I've been getting

3303
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:42,420
on inositol is extremely deep

3304
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:44,490
and does seem to lead to enhanced levels

3305
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:46,050
of focus and alertness during the day.

3306
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:46,950
And perhaps you're noticing that

3307
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:47,850
'cause I'm talking more quickly

3308
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:49,470
on this podcast than in previous podcast.

3309
02:07:49,470 --> 02:07:50,303
No, I'm just kidding.

3310
02:07:50,303 --> 02:07:51,420
I don't think the two things relate

3311
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:53,400
in any kind of causal way.

3312
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:56,430
The point here is that inositol is known

3313
02:07:56,430 --> 02:07:59,400
to be pretty effective
in reducing anxiety,

3314
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:01,380
but when taken at very high dosages.

3315
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,150
Can it do the same at low dosages?

3316
02:08:03,150 --> 02:08:03,983
We don't know.

3317
02:08:03,983 --> 02:08:06,630
I would consider 900
milligrams a low dose.

3318
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:08,790
Most of this, given the fact

3319
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:11,820
that most of the studies of inositol

3320
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:13,440
have explored very high dosages,

3321
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:16,380
like even 10 or 12 grams per day,

3322
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:18,780
which I must say seems exceedingly high

3323
02:08:18,780 --> 02:08:20,520
and they do report that
some of the subjects

3324
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:22,770
in those experiments actually stop taking

3325
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:25,020
the inositol because of gastric discomfort

3326
02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:27,570
or gastric distress as it's called.

3327
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:30,123
So I've reported my results with sleep

3328
02:08:30,123 --> 02:08:32,220
in a kind of anecdotal way.

3329
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,570
They certainly aren't
peer-reviewed studies

3330
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:35,670
that I described about my own experience

3331
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:36,900
in an anecdotal way.

3332
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:39,310
But nonetheless, it's been explored that

3333
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,750
things like glycine, which is another,

3334
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,830
which is an amino acid,

3335
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:45,810
which also acts as an
inhibitory neurotransmitter

3336
02:08:45,810 --> 02:08:47,640
in the brain, taken at very high dosages,

3337
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:50,820
60 grams per day, that is a absolutely

3338
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:52,860
astonishingly high amount of glycine.

3339
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:55,110
I would not recommend
taking that much glycine

3340
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:56,400
unless you're part of a study

3341
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,980
where they tell you to
and you know it's safe.

3342
02:08:58,980 --> 02:09:01,980
18 grams, excuse me, of an inositol,

3343
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:04,740
these are very, very high
dosages used in these studies.

3344
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:06,960
Nonetheless, there's some interesting data

3345
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:09,520
about inositol leading to

3346
02:09:10,410 --> 02:09:13,620
some alleviation of OCD symptoms

3347
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:16,560
or partial alleviation of OCD symptoms

3348
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:20,400
in as little as two weeks after initiating

3349
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,780
the supplement protocol.

3350
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:24,030
So I think there's a great
future for these nutraceuticals,

3351
02:09:24,030 --> 02:09:26,070
meaning I think more
systematic exploration

3352
02:09:26,070 --> 02:09:27,390
in particular of lower dosages

3353
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:29,850
in the context of OCD treatment.

3354
02:09:29,850 --> 02:09:33,780
And as we saw before for the SSRIs

3355
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:35,610
and other prescription drug treatments,

3356
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:37,710
I think there really
needs to be an exploration

3357
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:39,660
of these nutraceuticals in combination

3358
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:40,740
with behavioral therapies.

3359
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:42,510
And who knows, maybe with
brain machine interface

3360
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:45,240
like cranial magnetic stimulation as well.

3361
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:47,160
Now way back at the
beginning of the episode,

3362
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,430
I alluded to the fact
that OCD is one thing,

3363
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:51,720
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

3364
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:54,090
and it's truly a disorder
and it's truly debilitating

3365
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:55,653
and it's extremely common,

3366
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:58,020
and then there's this other thing

3367
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,420
called obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,

3368
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:01,950
which is distinct from that

3369
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:05,040
does not have the intrusive component

3370
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,630
so people don't feel overwhelmed

3371
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:09,660
or overtaken by these thoughts,

3372
02:10:09,660 --> 02:10:12,510
rather, they find that the obsessions

3373
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:15,848
can sometimes serve them
or they even welcome them.

3374
02:10:15,848 --> 02:10:17,700
And I think many of us
know people like this,

3375
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:20,160
I perhaps even could be
accused or who knows,

3376
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:21,570
maybe have been accused of having

3377
02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:25,050
an obsessive-compulsive
personality at times.

3378
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:26,250
Why do I draw this distinction?

3379
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:30,030
Well, first of all, we've come
to a point in human history,

3380
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,610
I think in large part
because of social media

3381
02:10:32,610 --> 02:10:33,450
but also in large part

3382
02:10:33,450 --> 02:10:36,300
because there are a number
of discussions being held

3383
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:40,500
about mental health that have
brought terms like trauma,

3384
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,440
depression, OCD, et cetera,

3385
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,930
into the common vernacular

3386
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:48,840
so that people will
say, ah, you're so OCD,

3387
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,960
or someone will say I
was traumatized by that,

3388
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,070
or I was traumatized by this.

3389
02:10:53,070 --> 02:10:54,480
We should be very careful, right?

3390
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,790
I'm certainly not the word police,

3391
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:59,670
but we should be very careful in the use

3392
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:01,590
of certain types of language,

3393
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:05,190
especially language that
has real psychiatric

3394
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:06,820
and psychological definitions

3395
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,780
because it can really draw us off course

3396
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:11,940
in providing relief for
some of these syndromes.

3397
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:13,053
For instance,

3398
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:16,530
the word trauma is thrown
around left and right nowadays.

3399
02:11:16,530 --> 02:11:18,690
I was traumatized by this,
or that caused trauma,

3400
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:20,550
you're giving me trauma.

3401
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:23,160
Listen, I realize that many people

3402
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:24,900
are traumatized by certain events

3403
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:26,640
including things that are said to them,

3404
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:27,990
I absolutely acknowledge that,

3405
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:31,080
hence our episodes on
trauma and trauma treatment,

3406
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:32,970
several of them, in fact.

3407
02:11:32,970 --> 02:11:35,940
Dr. Conti, Dr. David Spiegel,

3408
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:38,190
and then dedicated solo episodes

3409
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:41,670
with just me blabbing about
trauma and trauma treatment.

3410
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:44,943
But as Dr. Conti so
appropriately pointed out,

3411
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:48,780
trauma is really something that changes

3412
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:51,900
our neural circuitry and
therefore our thoughts

3413
02:11:51,900 --> 02:11:54,180
and our behaviors in a very persistent way

3414
02:11:54,180 --> 02:11:55,530
that is detrimental to us.

3415
02:11:55,530 --> 02:11:57,630
Not every bad event is traumatizing,

3416
02:11:57,630 --> 02:11:59,880
not everything that we
dislike or even that we hate

3417
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,070
or that feels terrible
to us is traumatizing.

3418
02:12:02,070 --> 02:12:04,890
For something to reach
the level of trauma,

3419
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:07,710
it really needs to change
our neural circuitry

3420
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:09,660
and therefore our
thoughts and our behaviors

3421
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:12,600
in a persistent way that
is maladaptive for us.

3422
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:17,190
Similarly, just calling
someone obsessive is one thing,

3423
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:20,100
saying that someone has
OCD or assuming one has OCD

3424
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:23,010
simply because they have a
personality or a phenotype,

3425
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:25,290
as we say, where they need
things in perfect order,

3426
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:27,090
like I find myself correcting these pens

3427
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:29,490
making sure that the caps are facing

3428
02:12:29,490 --> 02:12:32,640
in the same direction
for instance right now,

3429
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:35,280
that is not the same as OCD.

3430
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,200
If, for instance, I
can tolerate these pens

3431
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:38,460
being at different orientation

3432
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:40,230
or even throw the cap on
the floor or something,

3433
02:12:40,230 --> 02:12:42,060
it doesn't create a lot of anxiety for me.

3434
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,190
I confess, I agree it's a
little bit in the moment,

3435
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:45,990
but then I can forget
about it and move on.

3436
02:12:45,990 --> 02:12:47,730
That's one of the key distinctions

3437
02:12:47,730 --> 02:12:50,640
between obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder

3438
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:53,070
and obsessive-compulsive disorder

3439
02:12:53,070 --> 02:12:54,870
in its strictest form.

3440
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:56,940
Now, once one hears that OCD

3441
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,290
is different than obsessive-compulsive

3442
02:12:58,290 --> 02:13:01,080
personality disorder
because of this difference

3443
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:03,720
in how intrusive the thoughts are or not,

3444
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:06,780
then that's useful, but
it really doesn't tell us

3445
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:09,420
anything about what is
happening mechanistically

3446
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:11,550
in one situation or another.

3447
02:13:11,550 --> 02:13:14,070
Fortunately, there are
beautiful data again

3448
02:13:14,070 --> 02:13:15,750
from Dr. Blair Simpson's lab.

3449
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:17,970
And you can tell based
on the number of studies

3450
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:19,770
that I've referred to from her laboratory,

3451
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:22,920
she's truly one of the
luminaries in this field,

3452
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:26,790
that there really are some
fundamental wiring differences

3453
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:29,580
and behavioral differences
and psychological differences

3454
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:32,430
between people who have
obsessive-compulsive disorder

3455
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:34,230
and those who have obsessive-compulsive

3456
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:36,450
personality disorder.

3457
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:39,990
So this is a study, first
author, Pinto, P-I-N-T-O

3458
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:42,930
entitled, Capacity to
delay reward differentiates

3459
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:44,280
obsessive-compulsive disorder

3460
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:47,280
and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

3461
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:50,070
And the methods in this
study were to take 25 people

3462
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:53,790
with OCD and 25 people
with obsessive-compulsive

3463
02:13:53,790 --> 02:13:56,340
personality disorder and 25 people

3464
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:58,890
who have both, because it
is possible to have both

3465
02:13:58,890 --> 02:13:59,940
and that's important to point out,

3466
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:02,040
and 25 so-called healthy controls,

3467
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:03,720
people that don't have
obsessive-compulsive

3468
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:07,200
personality disorder or
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

3469
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:08,760
They take clinical assessments

3470
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,220
and then they took a number of tests

3471
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:15,720
that probed their ability
to defer gratification,

3472
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:17,070
something called, in the laboratory,

3473
02:14:17,070 --> 02:14:18,600
we call it delayed discounting.

3474
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:22,230
So their ability to defer gratification

3475
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:24,780
through a task where they
can either accept reward

3476
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,430
right away or accept reward later.

3477
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:28,890
Some of you may have heard
of the two marshmallow task.

3478
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:31,620
This is based on a study
that was performed years ago

3479
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:33,750
on young children at
Stanford and elsewhere

3480
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:36,180
where they take young
children into a room,

3481
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:39,180
they offer them a marshmallow,

3482
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:41,280
kids like marshmallows generally,

3483
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:44,280
and you say, you can eat
the marshmallow right now

3484
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:46,440
or you can wait some period of time,

3485
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,380
and if you are able to wait
and not eat the marshmallow,

3486
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:50,970
you can have two marshmallows.

3487
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:53,190
And in general, children
want two marshmallows

3488
02:14:53,190 --> 02:14:54,690
more than they want one marshmallow.

3489
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:56,370
So really what you're probing is

3490
02:14:56,370 --> 02:14:59,040
their ability to access
delayed gratification.

3491
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,560
And they're very entertaining,

3492
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:06,560
even truly amusing videos
of this on the internet.

3493
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:09,480
So if you just do two
marshmallow task video

3494
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:10,313
and you go into YouTube,

3495
02:15:10,313 --> 02:15:12,270
what you'll find is that
the children will use

3496
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:16,140
all sorts of strategies
to delay gratification.

3497
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:18,750
Some of the kids will
cover the marshmallow.

3498
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:20,400
Others will talk to the
marshmallow and say,

3499
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,690
I know you're not that delicious.

3500
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:23,430
You look delicious, but
no, you're not delicious.

3501
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:24,530
They'll engage with the marshmallow

3502
02:15:24,530 --> 02:15:25,770
in all sorts of cute ways.

3503
02:15:25,770 --> 02:15:27,960
They'll turn around and try
to, you know, avoidance,

3504
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,990
which actually speaks to a
whole category of behaviors

3505
02:15:30,990 --> 02:15:32,610
that people with OCD also use.

3506
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:34,230
I'm not saying these kids had OCD,

3507
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:38,670
but avoidance behaviors are
very much a component of OCD.

3508
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:40,440
People really trying to avoid the thing

3509
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:43,440
that evokes the obsession.

3510
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,440
Well some kids are able
to delay gratification,

3511
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:48,690
some aren't and it's
debatable as to whether or not

3512
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:50,520
the kids that are able
to delay gratification

3513
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,380
go on to have more
successful lives or not.

3514
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:54,180
Initially, that was the
conclusion of those studies.

3515
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:55,410
There's still a lot of debate about it,

3516
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:57,870
we'll bring an expert on to
give us the final conclusion

3517
02:15:57,870 --> 02:15:59,700
on this 'cause there is one
and it's very interesting

3518
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:01,050
and not intuitive.

3519
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:03,600
Nonetheless, adults are also faced

3520
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,880
with decisions every day, all day

3521
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:08,880
as to whether or not they
can delay gratification.

3522
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:13,410
And this study used a, not
a two marshmallow task,

3523
02:16:13,410 --> 02:16:16,230
but a game that involved rewards

3524
02:16:16,230 --> 02:16:17,670
where people could delay in order

3525
02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:19,320
to get greater rewards later.

3526
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:20,670
What is the conclusion?

3527
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:23,040
Well, first of all, obsessive-compulsive

3528
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:26,040
and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder subjects

3529
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:30,720
both showed impairments in
their psychosocial functioning

3530
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,860
and quality of life.

3531
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:34,260
They had compulsive behavior.

3532
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:36,330
So these are people that
are suffering in their life

3533
02:16:36,330 --> 02:16:39,090
because their compulsions
are really strong.

3534
02:16:39,090 --> 02:16:41,309
So it's not just being really nit-picky

3535
02:16:41,309 --> 02:16:42,629
or really orderly in one case

3536
02:16:42,629 --> 02:16:44,159
and having full blown OCD in the other,

3537
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:47,340
both sets of subjects
are challenged in life

3538
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:49,139
because they're having relationship issues

3539
02:16:49,139 --> 02:16:50,699
or job-related issues, et cetera,

3540
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:52,383
because they are that compulsive.

3541
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:55,530
However, the individuals with

3542
02:16:55,530 --> 02:16:58,559
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,

3543
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:01,949
they discounted the value
of delayed gratification

3544
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:03,299
significantly less than those

3545
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:05,402
with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

3546
02:17:06,270 --> 02:17:07,440
What do I mean?

3547
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:09,059
They are both impairing disorders

3548
02:17:09,059 --> 02:17:10,589
that are marked by compulsive behaviors,

3549
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:12,209
here I'm paraphrasing,

3550
02:17:12,209 --> 02:17:14,159
but they can be
differentiated by the presence

3551
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,510
of obsessions in OCD.

3552
02:17:15,510 --> 02:17:17,430
So obsessions in OCD.

3553
02:17:17,430 --> 02:17:21,629
People with OCD are absolutely fixated

3554
02:17:21,629 --> 02:17:24,299
on certain ideas and
those ideas are intrusive.

3555
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:26,189
Again, that's the hallmark theme.

3556
02:17:26,190 --> 02:17:29,219
And by an excessive
capacity to delay reward

3557
02:17:29,219 --> 02:17:31,469
in obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

3558
02:17:31,469 --> 02:17:33,779
That is people who have
obsessive-compulsive

3559
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:36,450
personality disorder are really good

3560
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:38,219
at delaying gratification.

3561
02:17:38,219 --> 02:17:41,669
So they are able to
concentrate very intensely

3562
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:44,309
and perform very intensely in ways

3563
02:17:44,309 --> 02:17:46,299
that allow them to instill order

3564
02:17:47,219 --> 02:17:49,319
such that they can delay reward.

3565
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:53,673
Now you can see why this
contour of symptoms,

3566
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:57,340
meaning that the people with OCD

3567
02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:00,930
are experiencing intrusive thoughts,

3568
02:18:00,930 --> 02:18:03,059
whereas the people with
obsessive-compulsive

3569
02:18:03,059 --> 02:18:06,179
personality disorder
show an enhanced ability

3570
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:07,833
to defer gratification.

3571
02:18:10,110 --> 02:18:11,370
You could see how that would lead

3572
02:18:11,370 --> 02:18:12,809
to very different outcomes.

3573
02:18:12,809 --> 02:18:15,569
People with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder

3574
02:18:15,570 --> 02:18:18,629
can actually leverage
that personality disorder

3575
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:21,089
to perform better in
certain domains of life,

3576
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:22,230
not all domains of life,

3577
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:23,070
because remember, again,

3578
02:18:23,070 --> 02:18:25,379
these people are in this study

3579
02:18:25,379 --> 02:18:28,259
and they're showing up as
experiencing challenges in life

3580
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:31,410
because of their obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.

3581
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:33,840
Nonetheless, people with
obsessive-compulsive

3582
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:35,309
personality disorder, you could imagine,

3583
02:18:35,309 --> 02:18:39,089
would be very good at say architecture

3584
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:41,670
or anything that involves
instilling a ton of order.

3585
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:44,820
Maybe sushi chef, for instance,
maybe a chef in general.

3586
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:46,799
I know chefs that just
kind of throw things around

3587
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:50,099
like the chef on the Muppets
and just like throw things

3588
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:51,540
everywhere and still produce amazing food.

3589
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:54,270
And then there's some people
there incredibly exacting,

3590
02:18:54,270 --> 02:18:55,830
they're just incredibly precise.

3591
02:18:55,830 --> 02:18:56,910
I think that movie, what is it?

3592
02:18:56,910 --> 02:18:58,440
Jiro Dreams of Sushi?

3593
02:18:58,440 --> 02:19:00,389
That movie is incredible.

3594
02:19:00,389 --> 02:19:02,189
Certainly not saying he
has obsessive-compulsive

3595
02:19:02,190 --> 02:19:04,350
personality disorder, but
I think it's fair to say

3596
02:19:04,350 --> 02:19:09,180
that he is obsessive or
extremely meticulous and orderly

3597
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,950
about everything from start to finish.

3598
02:19:10,950 --> 02:19:13,770
You can imagine a huge array
of different occupations

3599
02:19:13,770 --> 02:19:16,379
and life endeavors where
this would be beneficial,

3600
02:19:16,379 --> 02:19:18,509
science being one of them
where data collection

3601
02:19:18,510 --> 02:19:22,049
and analysis is exceedingly
important that one be precise,

3602
02:19:22,049 --> 02:19:25,709
or mathematics or physics or engineering,

3603
02:19:25,709 --> 02:19:27,989
anything where precision has a payoff

3604
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:32,100
and gaining precision takes time and delay

3605
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:34,200
of immediate gratification,

3606
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:35,790
you can imagine that obsessive-compulsive

3607
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:38,070
personality disorder would synergize well

3608
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:40,230
with those sorts of
activities and professions.

3609
02:19:40,230 --> 02:19:43,139
Whereas obsessive-compulsive
disorder is really intrusive.

3610
02:19:43,139 --> 02:19:46,139
It's preventing functionality in many

3611
02:19:46,139 --> 02:19:47,729
different domains of life.

3612
02:19:47,730 --> 02:19:51,330
So the key takeaway here is that

3613
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:53,730
when we use the words
obsessive-compulsive,

3614
02:19:53,730 --> 02:19:55,530
or we call someone obsessive-compulsive,

3615
02:19:55,530 --> 02:19:57,240
or we are trying to
evaluate whether or not

3616
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:58,500
we are obsessive compulsive,

3617
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:02,220
it's very important that we highlight

3618
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:05,520
that obsessive compulsive
disorder is very intrusive.

3619
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:06,780
It involves intrusive thoughts

3620
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:09,120
and it interrupts with
normal functioning in life.

3621
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:11,490
Whereas obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,

3622
02:20:11,490 --> 02:20:14,280
while it can interrupt
normal functioning in life,

3623
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,590
it also can be productive.

3624
02:20:16,590 --> 02:20:19,080
It can enhance functioning
in life, not just in work,

3625
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:21,120
but perhaps at home as well.

3626
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,430
If you are somebody and
you have family members

3627
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:25,260
that really place enormous value on having

3628
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:27,600
a beautiful and highly organized home,

3629
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:29,940
well, then it could lend
itself well to that.

3630
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:31,620
it's going to be a matter
of degrees, of course.

3631
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:33,150
None of these things is an absolute,

3632
02:20:33,150 --> 02:20:34,320
it's going to be on a continuum,

3633
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,690
but I think it is fair to
say that obsessive-compulsive

3634
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:39,120
disorder, whether or
not in mild, moderate,

3635
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:43,410
or severe form is impairing
normal functioning,

3636
02:20:43,410 --> 02:20:45,930
whereas obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder,

3637
02:20:45,930 --> 02:20:48,270
there's a range of expressions of that,

3638
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:49,590
some of which can be adaptive,

3639
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:51,030
some of which can be maladaptive,

3640
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:53,670
and again, it's all going
to depend on context.

3641
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:56,610
Before we conclude, I do
want to touch on something

3642
02:20:56,610 --> 02:20:58,530
that I think a lot of people experience

3643
02:20:58,530 --> 02:21:00,600
and that's superstitions.

3644
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,070
Superstitions are fascinating,

3645
02:21:02,070 --> 02:21:05,640
and there's some fascinating
research on superstitions.

3646
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:08,640
One particular study that I'm a big fan of

3647
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,250
is the work of Bence Olveczky at Harvard.

3648
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:14,550
He studies motor sequences
and motor learning,

3649
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:17,520
and he has beautiful
data on how people learn,

3650
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:19,500
for instance, a tennis swing

3651
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:23,160
and the patterns that
they engage in early on

3652
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:25,290
and then the patterns
of swinging that they,

3653
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:26,640
swinging the racket that is,

3654
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:29,730
that they engage in later
as they acquire more skill.

3655
02:21:29,730 --> 02:21:31,710
And basically the takeaway is that

3656
02:21:31,710 --> 02:21:34,860
the amount of error or
variation from swing to swing

3657
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:38,193
is dramatically reduced
as they acquire skill.

3658
02:21:39,150 --> 02:21:41,340
That's all fine and good,

3659
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:43,620
and there's some
beautiful mechanistic data

3660
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:46,140
that he and others have discovered

3661
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:48,240
to support how that comes to be,

3662
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:50,940
but they also explore animal models,

3663
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:54,870
in particular, rats pressing
sequences of buttons

3664
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:57,330
and levers to obtain a reward.

3665
02:21:57,330 --> 02:21:59,520
Believe it or not, rats are pretty smart.

3666
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:00,960
I've seen this with my own eyes.

3667
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:04,470
You can teach a rat to press
a lever for a pellet of food.

3668
02:22:04,470 --> 02:22:07,350
Rats can also learn to press levers

3669
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:10,140
in a particular sequence in order to gain

3670
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:11,310
a piece of food.

3671
02:22:11,310 --> 02:22:14,400
And they can actually learn to press

3672
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:17,280
an enormous number of levers
in very particular sequences

3673
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:19,200
in order to obtain pellets of food.

3674
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,570
You can also give them
little buttons to press

3675
02:22:21,570 --> 02:22:25,920
or even a paddle to, or I
should say a pedal, excuse me,

3676
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:27,390
to stomp on with their foot

3677
02:22:27,390 --> 02:22:29,190
in order to obtain a pellet of food.

3678
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:32,100
Basically rats can learn
exactly what they need to do

3679
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:34,770
in order to obtain a piece of food,

3680
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:35,670
especially if they're made

3681
02:22:35,670 --> 02:22:37,590
a little bit hungry first.

3682
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:40,080
Bence's lab has published beautiful data

3683
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:43,650
showing that as animals and humans

3684
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:45,780
come to learn a particular motor sequence,

3685
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:49,080
very often they will
introduce motor patterns

3686
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:52,860
in that sequence that are
irrelevant to the outcome

3687
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:54,600
and yet that persist.

3688
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:56,190
If you've ever watched a game of baseball,

3689
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:58,080
you've seen this before.

3690
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,760
Oftentimes the pitcher
up on the mound will

3691
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:03,960
bring the ball to their chin.

3692
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:05,550
They'll look over their shoulder,

3693
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:07,830
they'll look back over the other shoulder,

3694
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:11,790
and then they will, of course,
reel back and pitch the ball.

3695
02:23:11,790 --> 02:23:13,020
But if you watch closely,

3696
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:15,480
oftentimes there are components
in the motor sequence,

3697
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:18,000
which are completely
unrelated to the pitch.

3698
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,650
They're not looking necessarily to see

3699
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:21,150
if someone's stealing a base.

3700
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:23,190
They're not necessarily looking

3701
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:26,010
down at home plate where the batter is.

3702
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:27,600
They're also doing things like

3703
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,680
touching the back of their ear

3704
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:30,510
before they bring the ball to their chin

3705
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:31,650
or adjusting their hat.

3706
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:33,270
And if you watch individual pictures,

3707
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:35,310
what you'll find is that
they'll do the same sequence

3708
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:38,310
of completely irrelevant motor patterns

3709
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,590
before each and every single pitch.

3710
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:43,860
Similarly, rats that have
been trained to, for instance,

3711
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:47,070
hit two levers and step on a pedal

3712
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:49,810
with their left hind foot, and then

3713
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:53,220
tap a button up above
that is the red button,

3714
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:55,680
will do that to gain a piece of food.

3715
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:57,720
But sometimes they'll
also introduce a pattern

3716
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:00,510
into that motor sequence where they will

3717
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:01,680
shake their tail a little bit,

3718
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:02,820
or they'll turn their head a little bit,

3719
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:05,670
or they'll move their ears
a little bit, et cetera.

3720
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:07,440
Motor patterns that have nothing to do

3721
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:10,980
with obtaining the
particular outcome in mind.

3722
02:24:10,980 --> 02:24:12,780
In other words, you could eliminate

3723
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:14,430
certain components of the motor sequence

3724
02:24:14,430 --> 02:24:16,620
and it would not matter, the
rat would still get the pellet,

3725
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:19,560
the pitcher would still be able to pitch,

3726
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:21,710
and yet that get
introduced because somehow

3727
02:24:22,770 --> 02:24:25,710
because they were
performed again and again

3728
02:24:25,710 --> 02:24:28,830
prior to successful trials,

3729
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:32,430
the rat or the human baseball pitcher

3730
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:34,470
comes to believe in some way

3731
02:24:34,470 --> 02:24:37,200
that it was involved in
generating the outcome,

3732
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,120
hence superstition, right?

3733
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,400
I confess I have a few superstitions.

3734
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:43,470
I occasionally will knock on wood.

3735
02:24:43,470 --> 02:24:45,030
I'll say something that I want to happen,

3736
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:47,100
and I'll say, oh, knock on
wood, and I'll just do it.

3737
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,650
And occasionally I'll
challenge myself and think,

3738
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:51,450
ah, I don't want to knock,
don't knock on wood,

3739
02:24:51,450 --> 02:24:53,310
Andrew, don't do that.

3740
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:55,350
I don't think anyone
wants to be superstitious,

3741
02:24:55,350 --> 02:24:56,250
I certainly don't.

3742
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:57,210
And so every once in a while,

3743
02:24:57,210 --> 02:25:00,900
I'll just challenge it, and I
won't actually knock on wood.

3744
02:25:00,900 --> 02:25:02,700
I'm admitting this to you to kind of

3745
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:05,490
I guess normalize some of this.

3746
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:08,280
Some people have superstitions

3747
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:12,030
that border on or even become compulsions.

3748
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:13,320
They really come to believe

3749
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,940
that if they don't knock on wood,

3750
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:16,350
that something terrible
is going to happen,

3751
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:18,240
maybe something in particular.

3752
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,890
Or in the case of the baseball pitcher,

3753
02:25:19,890 --> 02:25:21,630
they come to believe
that if they don't touch

3754
02:25:21,630 --> 02:25:24,573
their right ear before they
reel back on the pitch,

3755
02:25:25,710 --> 02:25:27,870
that the pitch won't be any good

3756
02:25:27,870 --> 02:25:29,130
or that they're going to lose the game.

3757
02:25:29,130 --> 02:25:30,570
Well, I don't know what
their thought process is.

3758
02:25:30,570 --> 02:25:32,760
Now, I also don't know
what the rat is thinking,

3759
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:36,210
but the rat is clearly doing something

3760
02:25:36,210 --> 02:25:40,050
or thinking something is
related to the final outcome.

3761
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:42,270
I don't know of any studies
where they've intervened

3762
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:45,570
with the particular
superstition-like behaviors

3763
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:47,730
of the rat to see whether or not the rat

3764
02:25:47,730 --> 02:25:50,760
somehow doesn't continue
to do the motor sequence

3765
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:51,593
to get the pellet.

3766
02:25:51,593 --> 02:25:52,710
We don't know the rats, they're rats.

3767
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:54,300
I don't speak rat, most people don't,

3768
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:55,650
or if you speak to a rat,

3769
02:25:55,650 --> 02:25:57,210
if it speaks back, it's not in English.

3770
02:25:57,210 --> 02:26:01,500
Anyway, the point is that
superstitions are beliefs

3771
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:05,890
that we, on an individual
scale, come to believe

3772
02:26:06,810 --> 02:26:09,510
are linked to the
probability of an outcome

3773
02:26:09,510 --> 02:26:12,870
when in fact we know, we actually know

3774
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:16,200
in our rational minds, they
have no real relationship

3775
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:17,033
to the outcome.

3776
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:20,190
Superstitions can become full-blown

3777
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:21,940
compulsions and obsessions

3778
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:25,200
when we repeat them often enough

3779
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,580
that they become automatic.

3780
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:28,890
And I think this is what
we observe most of the time

3781
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:31,410
when we see a pitcher touching their ear,

3782
02:26:31,410 --> 02:26:33,720
or for instance, in
tennis, you see this a lot,

3783
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:36,600
you'll see someone
they'll slap their shoes.

3784
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,040
Often, I see this, they'll like slap

3785
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:39,570
the undersides of their soles.

3786
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:41,700
They may tell themselves
that this is, I don't know,

3787
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:43,560
maybe moving out some
of the dust or something

3788
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,550
in the bottoms of their soles,

3789
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:46,560
that gives them more
traction and they want that

3790
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,930
to be ready for the serve
or something like that.

3791
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:50,340
And maybe there's some truth to that,

3792
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,377
but here, what we're referring to

3793
02:26:52,377 --> 02:26:55,470
are behaviors that really
have no rational relationship

3794
02:26:55,470 --> 02:26:58,383
to the outcome, and yet we
perform in a compulsive way.

3795
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:03,360
People with OCD, yes, tend
to have more superstitions.

3796
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:05,550
People with more superstitions, yes,

3797
02:27:05,550 --> 02:27:08,547
tend to have a tendency towards OCD

3798
02:27:08,547 --> 02:27:10,740
and I should mention, obsessive-compulsive

3799
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,150
personality disorder.

3800
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:15,780
If you think way back to the
first part of this episode,

3801
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:18,000
when I was just describing
what the brain does, right?

3802
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:18,833
What does your brain do?

3803
02:27:18,833 --> 02:27:20,700
Housekeeping functions to keep you alive

3804
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:22,980
and it's a prediction machine.

3805
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:25,320
Your neural circuits, you,

3806
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:28,410
have an enormous amount
of biological investment

3807
02:27:28,410 --> 02:27:30,630
of real estate, literally,
cells and chemicals

3808
02:27:30,630 --> 02:27:34,530
that are there to try and
make your world predictable

3809
02:27:34,530 --> 02:27:36,570
and to try and give you control,

3810
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:39,390
or at least the sense of
control over that world

3811
02:27:39,390 --> 02:27:42,330
and that's a normal process.

3812
02:27:42,330 --> 02:27:45,900
Low-level superstitions,
moderate superstitions

3813
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:50,130
represent a kind of a
healthy range, I would say,

3814
02:27:50,130 --> 02:27:55,110
of behaviors that are aimed
at generating predictability

3815
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:57,240
that don't disrupt normal function.

3816
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:59,220
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,

3817
02:27:59,220 --> 02:28:00,420
provided is not too severe,

3818
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:02,580
would I think represent the next level

3819
02:28:02,580 --> 02:28:04,440
along that continuum.

3820
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:06,330
And then obsessive-compulsive disorder,

3821
02:28:06,330 --> 02:28:07,740
as I pointed out earlier,

3822
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:10,050
is really a case of highly debilitating,

3823
02:28:10,050 --> 02:28:14,220
highly intrusive, really
overtake of neural circuitry

3824
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:15,570
over our thoughts and behaviors

3825
02:28:15,570 --> 02:28:19,830
that requires very
dedicated, very persistent,

3826
02:28:19,830 --> 02:28:23,820
and very effective
treatments in order to stop

3827
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:25,200
those obsessions and compulsions

3828
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:27,600
and the anxiety that links them

3829
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:30,570
somewhat counterintuitively
by teaching people

3830
02:28:30,570 --> 02:28:33,330
to tolerate that level
of increased anxiety

3831
02:28:33,330 --> 02:28:35,040
and interrupt those patterns.

3832
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,020
And fortunately, as we described earlier,

3833
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:40,170
such treatments exist,
cognitive behavioral therapy,

3834
02:28:40,170 --> 02:28:43,380
drug treatments like
SSRIs, also drug treatments

3835
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:46,260
that tap into the glutamate system

3836
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:49,650
and into perhaps also the dopamine system,

3837
02:28:49,650 --> 02:28:50,880
the so-called neuroleptics.

3838
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:53,340
And then, as we described,

3839
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:55,260
there's now an extensive
exploration of things

3840
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:58,230
like ketamine, psilocybin, cannabis,

3841
02:28:58,230 --> 02:29:00,420
the initial studies don't
seem to hold much promise

3842
02:29:00,420 --> 02:29:02,580
for cannabis and CBD and
the treatment of OCD,

3843
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:04,740
but who knows, maybe more
studies will come along

3844
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:06,630
that will change that story.

3845
02:29:06,630 --> 02:29:08,130
And then of course,
brain machine interface

3846
02:29:08,130 --> 02:29:10,140
like transcranial magnetic stimulation.

3847
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:12,690
And then just to remind you
what I already told you before

3848
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:15,390
combinations of behavioral
and drug treatments

3849
02:29:15,390 --> 02:29:16,850
and brain machine interface, I think,

3850
02:29:16,850 --> 02:29:18,420
is really where the future lies.

3851
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:21,840
Fortunately, good treatments exist.

3852
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:24,990
We cannot say that any
one individual treatment

3853
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:26,220
works for everybody.

3854
02:29:26,220 --> 02:29:29,430
There are fairly large
percentages of people

3855
02:29:29,430 --> 02:29:31,530
that won't respond to one
set of treatments or another,

3856
02:29:31,530 --> 02:29:34,080
and therefore one has
to try different ones.

3857
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:37,830
And then there are the
so-called supplementation-based

3858
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:39,810
or more holistic therapies.

3859
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:41,330
Today, I've tried to cover each and all

3860
02:29:41,330 --> 02:29:44,910
of these in a fairly
substantial amount of detail.

3861
02:29:44,910 --> 02:29:47,670
I realize this is a fairly long episode,

3862
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:49,620
that is intentional.

3863
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:51,780
Much like our episode on ADHD,

3864
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:54,180
on attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder,

3865
02:29:54,180 --> 02:29:56,310
I received an enormous number of requests

3866
02:29:56,310 --> 02:29:59,190
to talk about OCD, and
my decision to make this

3867
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:03,000
a very long and detailed episode about OCD

3868
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,650
really doesn't stem from any desire

3869
02:30:04,650 --> 02:30:07,590
to subject you to too much information

3870
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:11,610
or to avoid the opportunity
to just list things off,

3871
02:30:11,610 --> 02:30:13,590
but what I've tried to
provide is an opportunity

3872
02:30:13,590 --> 02:30:15,807
to really drill deep
into the neural circuitry

3873
02:30:15,807 --> 02:30:18,420
and an understanding of
where OCD comes from,

3874
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:20,790
how OCD is different from things like

3875
02:30:20,790 --> 02:30:22,950
the personality disorders
that I described.

3876
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:26,850
And also to give you a
sense of how the individual

3877
02:30:26,850 --> 02:30:28,410
behavioral and drug treatments work

3878
02:30:28,410 --> 02:30:29,940
and perhaps don't work

3879
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:32,490
so that you can really make
the best informed choices,

3880
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:34,620
again, highlighting the fact that OCD

3881
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:37,830
is an extremely common, extremely common,

3882
02:30:37,830 --> 02:30:40,440
and yet extremely debilitating condition

3883
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,450
and one that I hope
that if any of you have,

3884
02:30:42,450 --> 02:30:44,010
or that you know people that have it

3885
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:46,950
that you'll both gain
sympathy and understanding

3886
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:48,180
for what they're dealing with,

3887
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:49,190
perhaps as a consequence of some

3888
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:51,060
of the information presented today,

3889
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:54,630
and maybe help them
direct their treatment,

3890
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:56,940
find better treatment, and of course,

3891
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:59,220
apply those treatments for some relief.

3892
02:30:59,220 --> 02:31:01,440

In addition, please check out the sponsors

3907
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:31,710
mentioned at the beginning
of today's podcast,

3908
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:33,930
that's the best way to support us.

3909
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:36,390
During today's podcast and
on many previous episodes

3910
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:39,210
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we talk about supplements.

3911
02:31:39,210 --> 02:31:41,370
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

3912
02:31:41,370 --> 02:31:43,290
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

3913
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:46,290
for things like sleep and
focus and anxiety and so on.

3914
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:48,150
The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered

3915
02:31:48,150 --> 02:31:49,740
with Momentous Supplements

3916
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:50,940
because Momentous Supplements

3917
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:52,650
are of the very highest quality,

3918
02:31:52,650 --> 02:31:55,230
they ship everywhere in the
world, not just in the US,

3919
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:56,760
and we wanted to have one location

3920
02:31:56,760 --> 02:31:59,370
where people could go in order
to access the supplements

3921
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:02,010
that we described and
detail the various roles of

3922
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:03,810
here on The Huberman Lab Podcast.

3923
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:06,030
If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,

3924
02:32:06,030 --> 02:32:07,950
you can find those supplements.

3925
02:32:07,950 --> 02:32:09,660
the catalog of supplements available there

3926
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:11,160
is going to be expanding quite a bit

3927
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:12,480
in the weeks and months to come.

3928
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:13,830
But right now, already, there are a number

3929
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:15,960
of different supplements
for enhancing focus,

3930
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:18,300
enhancing sleep, and so
on that are available.

3931
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:21,030
Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.

3932
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:22,920
If you're not already
following Huberman Lab

3933
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:24,780
on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

3934
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:27,390
There I cover science and
science-related tools,

3935
02:32:27,390 --> 02:32:29,220
some of which overlap with the content

3936
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:30,390
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3937
02:32:30,390 --> 02:32:32,310
and some of which is
distinct from the content

3938
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:33,540
on The Huberman Lab Podcast.

3939
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:35,697
So again, that's hubermanlab on Instagram

3940
02:32:35,697 --> 02:32:38,040
and hubermanlab also on Twitter.

3941
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:39,210
If you haven't already subscribed

3942
02:32:39,210 --> 02:32:40,980
to our Neural Network Newsletter,

3943
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:42,210
this is a monthly newsletter.

3944
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:44,040
It's completely zero cost.

3945
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:46,320
You go to hubermanlab.com.

3946
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:48,750
You go into the menu,
you click on newsletter,

3947
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:50,370
you can see some example newsletters,

3948
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:51,870
for instance, a toolkit for sleep.

3949
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:53,130
You can download that right away.

3950
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:54,930
You don't even have to
sign up for the newsletter.

3951
02:32:54,930 --> 02:32:57,600
You can get the toolkit
for neuroplasticity,

3952
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,890
for the use of cold,

3953
02:32:58,890 --> 02:33:01,680
for the use of heat in
health and et cetera.

3954
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:02,513
All of that's there.

3955
02:33:02,513 --> 02:33:03,690
And if you sign up for the newsletter,

3956
02:33:03,690 --> 02:33:05,970
you'll get the monthly
newsletter sent to you.

3957
02:33:05,970 --> 02:33:09,120
We don't share your email
information with every anybody,

3958
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,250
and we have a very clear
privacy policy there.

3959
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:12,990
So again, it's the
Neural Network Newsletter

3960
02:33:12,990 --> 02:33:16,110
available within the newsletter tab

3961
02:33:16,110 --> 02:33:18,480
under the menu at hubermanlab.com.

3962
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:19,890
In closing, I'd like to thank you

3963
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:21,780
for this in-depth discussion

3964
02:33:21,780 --> 02:33:24,480
about the mechanisms
and various treatments

3965
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:26,097
for obsessive-compulsive disorder

3966
02:33:26,097 --> 02:33:28,170
and some of the related disorders.

3967
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:31,277
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

3968
02:33:31,277 --> 02:33:34,444
