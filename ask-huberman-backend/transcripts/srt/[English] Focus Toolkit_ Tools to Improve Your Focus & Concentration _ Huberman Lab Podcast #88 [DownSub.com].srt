1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,780
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,890
where we discuss science
and science based tools

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,913
for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,990
I'm Andrew Huberman

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,690
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,430
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,520
Today we are discussing
focus and concentration

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,700
and tools for improving your
focus and concentration.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,530
This is a topic that
I've covered previously

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,290
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
but in different contexts.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,930
For instance, we had a very
popular episode on ADHD,

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,090
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,100
which of course relates
to the topic of focus

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,480
and how to improve focus.

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,480
We've also talked a lot about
dopamine motivation and drive.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,580
In fact, that's the title of your previous

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,877
also quite popular
episode of this podcast,

18
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:45,300
but never before have we had a
single episode solely devoted

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,910
to the tools to improve
focus and concentration.

20
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,950
The rationale for recording this episode

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,560
is to provide people one
location where they can go

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,480
and quickly access the specific tools

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,460
for increasing focus and concentration

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,040
that are known to be
the most powerful tools

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,750
and the most up to date tools.

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,540
In fact, today's episode is
going to include description

27
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,400
of several peer reviewed studies

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,540
and the tools that emerge

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,370
from those scientific
peer reviewed studies

30
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,690
that point to new,

31
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,030
and fortunately, even briefer protocols

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,350
than I've described before.

33
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,140
So what I'm basically
describing here is tools

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,060
that in a very short amount of time

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,660
will allow you to significantly increase

36
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,560
your focus and concentration abilities.

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,600
Those tools will include behavioral tools,

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
nutrition based tools,
supplement based tools,

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,920
brain machine interface based tools,

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,410
and for those of you that
are working with a physician,

41
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,120
prescription drug tools.

42
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,160
Today's episode ought to benefit anybody,

43
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,350
young or old or anything in between

44
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,990
whether or not you have ADHD or not.

45
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,730
Today's episode is going to give you tools

46
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,560
that you can apply in your daily life,

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,630
most all of them are completely zero cost

48
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,910
and those tools will allow you

49
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,650
to tap into the neurochemistry

50
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,780
and the neurocircuits
within your brain and body

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,420
that peer-reviewed
science has reliably shown

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,040
can significantly improve

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,470
your focus and concentration abilities.

54
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,400
Just to give you a little teaser

55
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,080
of the kinds of tools that
I'm going to provide you

56
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,310
on today's episode,

57
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,110
a previous guest on the
Huberman Lab Podcast

58
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,400
was Dr. Wendy Suzuki.

59
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,669
Dr. Suzuki is a professor of
psychology and neuroscience

60
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,090
at New York University, or NYU
as it's commonly referred to.

61
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,810
She's also the Dean of
Arts and Sciences at NYU.

62
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,210
Her laboratory made a
very important discovery,

63
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,940
which was that a very brief, just 12,

64
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,520
actually 13 if you really count the intro,

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,010
but 13 minute daily meditation

66
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,620
performed for a period
of about eight weeks

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,030
significantly increased

68
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,160
people's focus and
concentration abilities.

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,410
And the great news is you
didn't need all eight weeks,

70
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,540
it was just that's how long
that you ran the study.

71
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,710
So during today's episode,

72
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,840
I will describe that protocol in detail.

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,820
I'll also provide you an even briefer

74
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,430
alternative to that
protocol that you can use,

75
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,810
if for instance, you find yourself

76
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,610
with only three minutes or four minutes

77
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,770
or five minutes a day to meditate.

78
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,930
The great news is there's
quality peer reviewed science

79
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,150
to support that form of meditation

80
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,820
for improving focus and concentration.

81
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,910
And that falls under the
bin of these zero cost tools

82
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,010
that you can really use to
tap into the neurochemistry

83
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,810
and neurocircuits that really allow you

84
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,490
to take control of your
cognitive abilities

85
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,500
and improve them over time.

86
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,120
I'll also provide you important details

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
about that protocol and other protocols.

88
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,940
For instance,

89
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,100
contrary to popular belief, it is not,

90
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,960
I repeat it is not a good idea

91
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,360
to do a focused based meditation

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,850
within the four hours before bedtime.

93
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,683
Many people,

94
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,580
including some of the
subjects in that study

95
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,658
performed by the Suzuki lab,

96
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:30,030
found that when they did a
focusing meditation protocol,

97
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,620
even if it was very calming,

98
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,860
it led to difficulties in
falling and staying asleep.

99
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,600
So that runs counter to
a lot of what we've heard

100
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,340
about meditation being great for sleep.

101
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,200
It turns out meditation
might be great for sleep,

102
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,780
it certainly is great for
improving focus capacity,

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,670
but I highly recommend that
if you're going to apply

104
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,530
a focus meditation tool

105
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,840
in order to improve your
focus and concentration,

106
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,610
that you make sure that that's performed

107
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,580
not within four hours prior to bedtime.

108
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,870
So that's just a brief example

109
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,820
of the sorts of tools and protocols

110
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,530
and details about the tools and protocols

111
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,540
that I'll provide on today's episode.

112
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,760
I should mention that
we have provided links

113
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,020
in the show note captions

114
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,630
so that you can quickly go to
the studies that we describe

115
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,190
as well as some of the behavioral tools

116
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,620
and other tools that we'll cover,

117
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,150
things like the use of binaural beats,

118
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,350
supplements, et cetera.

119
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,280
Our goal here again

120
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,589
is to provide you the
maximum number of tools

121
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,049
for focus and concentration
that you can pick from

122
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,730
and choose from and apply in your life

123
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,670
and try to eliminate as
much of the legwork required

124
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,010
to seek out and apply those tools.

125
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,900
I'm pleased to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast

126
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,210
is now partnered with
Momentous supplements.

127
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,460
We partnered with Momentous
for several important reasons.

128
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,293
First of all,

129
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:34,140
they ship internationally,

130
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,520
because we know that many of you

131
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,910
are located outside of the
United States, that's valuable.

132
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,920
Second of all, and perhaps most important,

133
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,500
the quality of their
supplements is second to none,

134
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,150
both in terms of purity and precision

135
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,100
of the amounts of the ingredients.

136
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,710
Third, we've really emphasized supplements

137
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,780
that are single ingredient supplements

138
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,000
and that are supplied in dosages

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,970
that allow you to build a
supplementation protocol

140
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,800
that's optimized for cost,

141
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,690
that's optimized for effectiveness,

142
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,160
and that you can add things

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,810
and remove things from your protocol

144
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,850
in a way that's really
systematic and scientific.

145
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,200
This is really hard to do

146
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,060
if you're taking blends
of different supplements

147
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,790
or if the dosages are such
that you can't titrate,

148
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,180
or that is adjust the dosages,
of a given supplement.

149
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,820
So by using single ingredient supplements,

150
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,500
you can really build
out the supplement kit

151
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,590
that's ideal for you
and your specific needs.

152
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,760
If you'd like to see the supplements

153
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,080
that we partner with Momentous on,

154
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,200
you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.

155
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,310
There you'll see those supplements.

156
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,360
And just keep in mind

157
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,880
that we are constantly expanding
the library of supplements

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,106
available through Momentous
on a regular basis.

159
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,668
Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.

160
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:38,940
Before we begin,

161
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,530
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

162
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,230
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

163
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,300
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

164
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,130
to bring zero cost to consumer information

165
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,110
about science and science related tools

166
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,490
to the general public.

167
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,600
In keeping with that theme,

168
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,300
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

169
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,220
Our first sponsor is Thesis.

170
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,020
Thesis makes custom nootropics.

171
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,853
And to be quite honest,

172
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,360
I don't like the word nootropics

173
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,429
because the translation of
nootropics is smart drugs.

174
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,940
And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you

175
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,790
there is no neural circuit
in the brain for being smart.

176
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,710
Rather, there are neural circuits

177
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,060
that are responsible for focus,

178
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,890
neural circuits for creativity,

179
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,830
neural circuits, for task
switching and so on and so on.

180
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,720
Fortunately, Thesis understands this

181
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,280
and has developed custom nootropics

182
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,930
that are tailored to your specific goals

183
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,520
and your specific needs.

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,340
They use only the highest
quality ingredients,

185
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,860
things of the sort that we'll
talk about in today's podcast,

186
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,320
things like Alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine,

187
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,970
ginko biloba, et cetera.

188
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,370
However, I should mention that
they are customized to you.

189
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,740
So you can go to Thesis,
take a brief quiz,

190
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,200
and you can get a nootropic starter kit

191
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,120
that will allow you to
try various nootropics

192
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,707
and determine which ones
you like and work for you

193
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,880
and which ones don't.

194
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,220
I've been using Thesis
nootropics customized for me

195
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,480
for close to six months now

196
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,620
and can confidently say

197
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,170
that their nootropics have
been a total game changer.

198
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,570
My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula,

199
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,220
I like to use that before cognitive work,

200
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,650
and I use the Energy
Formula before my workouts.

201
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,570
To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,

202
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,360
go online to takethesis.com/huberman,

203
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,590
take that three minute quiz

204
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,480
and Thesis will send you
four different formulas

205
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,620
to try in your first month.

206
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,290
Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

207
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,120
and use the code Huberman at checkout

208
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,340
to get 10% off your first box.

209
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,770
Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.

210
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,270
LMNT is an electrolyte drink

211
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,940
that has all the things you
need and none of what you don't.

212
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,230
That means the electrolytes,

213
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,750
salt, magnesium, and
potassium are in there,

214
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,030
but it does not have sugar.

215
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,430
Electrolytes are key to cellular function,

216
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,890
in particular neuronal
or nerve cell function.

217
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,150
In fact, for your nerve cells

218
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,980
to be able to fire action potentials,

219
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,540
those are the electrical signals

220
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,950
that allow your brain and body

221
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,680
to work and move and think,
et cetera, you need sodium,

222
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,150
a lot of people don't realize that.

223
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,530
And while of course there
are people out there

224
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,480
that need to reduce their sodium intake,

225
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,150
these would be people with
pre-hypertension or hypertension,

226
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,070
many people actually
don't get enough sodium,

227
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,770
especially people that are
following low carbohydrate diets,

228
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,830
drinking a lot of caffeine
or eating extremely clean.

229
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,720
Oftentimes, those people feel better

230
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,190
when they increase their sodium intake

231
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,390
and their health can actually improve

232
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,860
when they increase their sodium intake.

233
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,870
LMNT contains a science
backed electrolyte ratio

234
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,420
of one gram of sodium, 200
milligrams of potassium

235
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,340
and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

236
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,510
If you'd like to try LMNT,

237
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,440
you can go to drinklmnt,
that's l-m-n-t.com/huberman

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,750
to claim a free element
sample pack with any purchase.

239
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,380
Again, that's drink LMNT,
l-m-n-t.com/huberman.

240
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,662
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.

241
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,490
Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

242
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,520
with heating, cooling, and
sleep tracking capacity.

243
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,890
The reality is that
sleep is the foundation

244
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,350
of mental health, physical
health, and performance.

245
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,600
Now I've talked before in
this podcast about the fact

246
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,150
that there's a direct
relationship between temperature

247
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,130
and our ability to fall and stay asleep.

248
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,299
In fact, our body temperature

249
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,069
needs to drop by about
one to three degrees

250
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,903
in order to fall asleep

251
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:45,480
and then there are further
decreases in our body temperature

252
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,730
that allow us to get into
the deepest stages of sleep

253
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,980
and the so-called rapid
eye movement sleep,

254
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,000
all the aspects of sleep

255
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
that really restore our brain and body.

256
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,850
And then waking up

257
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,730
actually involves a heating
up of core body temperature.

258
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,800
By sleeping on an Eight
Sleep mattress cover,

259
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,360
you're able to control the temperature

260
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,310
of your sleeping environment precisely.

261
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,710
I've been sleeping on an
Eight Sleep mattress cover

262
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,970
for many months now

263
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,520
and I can tell you it has
completely changed my sleep.

264
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,484
I thought I was sleeping
pretty well before and now,

265
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,420
frankly, I don't even want to travel

266
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,920
because I don't want to be
away from my Eight Sleep.

267
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,340
I can't wait until hotels and
Airbnbs include Eight Sleep.

268
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,300
If you want to try Eight Sleep,

269
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,640

276
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,500
off an Eight Sleep cover
now through September 11th.

277
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,290
Okay, let's talk about
focus and concentration

278
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,020
and how you can improve
your focus and concentration

279
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,600
using science based protocols.

280
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,360
Now because today's episode
is mainly focused on tools

281
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,760
and not so much the underlying mechanisms,

282
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,860
I'm mainly going to focus
on what to do and when

283
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,120
and how to do it.

284
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,460
But I just want to take
about three minutes

285
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,320
and briefly describe a model,

286
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,350
that is a visual image that
you can put in your mind,

287
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,440
that will help you incorporate
the tools that I'll provide

288
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,570
and that generally will
help you understand

289
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,470
at a mechanistic level how
focus and concentration work.

290
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,650
So what I want you to imagine is an arrow.

291
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,810
And an arrow of course, has an arrowhead

292
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,180
and it has the shaft of that arrow.

293
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,400
And in the context of the neuroscience

294
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,380
of focus and concentration,

295
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,210
the neurochemical system

296
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,760
that really represents
the shaft of that arrow,

297
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,460
right, the straight line is epinephrine,

298
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,750
also called adrenaline.

299
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,583
And today,

300
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,200
I'll refer to adrenaline and
epinephrine interchangeably.

301
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,480
Turns out that epinephrine/adrenaline

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,330
are released within your
brain from a little location,

303
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,280
a little cluster of neurons
called locus coeruleus,

304
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,320
but you do not need to remember that name,

305
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,977
and from your body from
the adrenal glands.

306
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:50,610
And the release of epinephrine
from those two locations

307
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,420
overall increases energy,
it increases alertness.

308
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,510
It does not alone increase focus, okay?

309
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,750
So the reason I've assigned epinephrine,

310
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,640
adrenaline as the shaft of the arrow

311
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,580
is that if focus is the arrow,

312
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,640
there is no focus without epinephrine.

313
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,960
So things,

314
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,780
whether or not they're
behavioral or psychological

315
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,800
or supplements or drugs
that increase epinephrine

316
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,220
allow focus to occur, they
are necessary for focus,

317
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,560
but they are not sufficient for focus,

318
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,640
that is they are required

319
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,220
but they are not enough to create focus.

320
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,680
So we're going to need
epinephrine in the equation.

321
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,210
Without epinephrine, there
is no focus or concentration.

322
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,560
Now the arrowhead on this
metaphorical arrowhead

323
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,660
that represents focus and concentration

324
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,250
is going to be represented

325
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,370
or related to the
mechanisms of acetylcholine,

326
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,050
a different neurochemical

327
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,520
that also exists in the brain and body.

328
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,353
In fact, in the body,

329
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,186
it's responsible

330
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,570
for the contraction and
movement of your muscles.

331
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,340
But today, we're talking
about acetylcholine

332
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,330
not in that context,

333
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,060
but rather in the context of
its release within the brain.

334
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,110
Acetylcholine is released

335
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,060
from a couple of different
locations in the brain

336
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,390
and the best way to think about
it is it's like a spotlight.

337
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,510
It highlights specific
neurons, nerve cells

338
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,000
that should be active, or
more active I should say,

339
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,890
than the other neurons in the environment.

340
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,420
So the reason I've assigned
the arrowhead to acetylcholine

341
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,250
and acetylcholine to the arrowhead

342
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,910
is that if you have an arrow
with a very big arrowhead

343
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,530
that's really broad, really broad,

344
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,600
imagine a mile wide arrowhead,

345
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
that's not very focused
on any one location,

346
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,190
it's not really pointing
to any one location, is it?

347
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,450
But with a narrow, really
tightly focused arrowhead,

348
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,430
well, that's focused on one location.

349
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,710
So we have alertness, epinephrine,

350
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,590
and then we have the actual direction

351
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,650
in which our concentration
and focus is placed,

352
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,670
and that's,

353
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,700
at least in this mental model
I'm creating, acetylcholine.

354
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,930
And then in order to have ongoing focus,

355
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,460
we need another neurochemical.

356
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,580
And it turns out that that
third neurochemical is dopamine,

357
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,000
a molecule often associated
with pleasure and reward,

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,210
but it's really the
molecule of motivation.

359
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,920
So here, I want you to
imagine in your mind,

360
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,570
an arrow with an arrowhead,

361
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,310
think acetylcholine in the arrowhead,

362
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,590
a shaft or a line behind that arrowhead,

363
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,080
which is epinephrine
also called adrenaline.

364
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,130
And then behind it,

365
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,220
a sort of an engine that keeps
that focus moving forward,

366
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,680
right because we don't just
want to be focused for a moment,

367
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,440
we want to be able to focus
for 10 minutes or for an hour

368
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,150
or maybe even for two hours.

369
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,130
Turns out there's an
optimal duration to focus,

370
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,020
I'll teach you that in just a little bit,

371
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,940
but these three neurochemicals together,

372
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,420
acetylcholine, epinephrine
and dopamine really allow you

373
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,830
to get focused, to focus very precisely,

374
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,620
and in fact, increasingly
precisely over time

375
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,510
to really narrow and narrow
and narrow your focus

376
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,390
progressively within a
single about of focus

377
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,737
and to continue to do that

378
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:49,560
and to be able to do that
repeatedly whenever you want.

379
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,780
So here, I'm purely talking in metaphor

380
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,940
and in models and mental models of arrows,

381
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,810
but in a moment or two,

382
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,150
I'll start transitioning
to discussing tools

383
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,170
in which I'll talk about

384
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,150
increasing dopamine and acetylcholine

385
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,520
or increasing epinephrine and dopamine

386
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,220
in various combinations
with various approaches.

387
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,320
And what I'd like you to conceptualize

388
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,090
is how those are contributing

389
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,730
to creating a very narrowly pointed arrow

390
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,780
that has the capacity

391
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,730
to continue moving forward over and over

392
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,570
so that you can focus as
sharply and as long as you like.

393
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,590
And of course, for those of you

394
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,600
that want to get really down in the weeds

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,770
of how dopamine works,

396
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,030
we have an entire episode

397
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,620
about dopamine motivation and drive

398
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,960
that really gets into
neurotransmitter release

399
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,030
and dopamine baselines and thresholds

400
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,620
and all of that sort of thing.

401
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,500
We also have episodes on focus,

402
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,600
much longer episodes,
I should say on focus

403
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,150
that incorporate a lot of
the biology of acetylcholine.

404
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,620
It turns out acetylcholine
is also involved

405
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,150
in neuroplasticity, et cetera,

406
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,607
and epinephrine of
course, relates to stress

407
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:46,890
and our capacity to deal
with and buffer stress

408
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,390
and on and on.

409
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,220
Those episodes are all available to you

410
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,950
in their long form at hubermanlab.com,

411
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,030
you can find them very easily.

412
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,920
They are all timestamped

413
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,880
so you can navigate to
the particular topics

414
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,960
most of interest to you.

415
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,000
I mention this all not as a diversion

416
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,410
from what we want to cover today,

417
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,730
but I know that some of you are hungry

418
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,170
for a lot more mechanism,

419
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,870
but today's episode is really
mainly focused on the tools,

420
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,210
I will of course touch on mechanism,

421
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,430
but if you really want to do
the deep dive on mechanism,

422
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,020
go to hubermanlab.com

423
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,060
and you'll have more
than you ever could want

424
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,800
about those mechanisms.

425
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,370
Let's jump into the tools
for concentration and focus.

426
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,700
If you want to think
about tools of any kind

427
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,910
to modify your biology
or physiology in any way,

428
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,200
whether or not it's for cognitive function

429
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,700
or you want to get better at exercising,

430
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,570
or you want to build muscle,

431
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,160
or you want to improve your hormones,

432
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,550
you need to think and understand tools

433
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,940
in the context of
modulation and mediation.

434
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,840
What do I mean by that?

435
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Well, it's quite simple really.

436
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,560
Mediation is how specific
types of chemicals and cells

437
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,860
and circuits and organs
control very specific things

438
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,090
in your brain and body

439
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,770
whereas modulation

440
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,920
is the ability of chemicals
and cells and circuits

441
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,950
to adjust how different things change,

442
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,020
how different things work
in your brain and body,

443
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,670
but to do it more broadly.

444
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,503
What do I mean by this?

445
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:04,800
Let me give an example.

446
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,560
For instance, I'm going to tell you now

447
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,020
that one of the most important things

448
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,040
to build and maintain your
focus and concentration

449
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,340
is to optimize your sleeping behavior,

450
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,709
that is to get enough quality sleep

451
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,080
I would say 80% of the
nights of your life.

452
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,850
Not everyone can get optimal sleep

453
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,230
100% of the nights of their life,

454
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,290
nobody, truly nobody achieves that.

455
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,450
However, sleep has been shown

456
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,750
to relate to cognitive
performance, physical performance,

457
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,330
hormone output, and so many other things,

458
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,400
including immune system function.

459
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,510
What we can reliably say
is that sleep modulates

460
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,900
just about every process
in your brain and body.

461
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,130
So you have to get great sleep.

462
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,250
There is simply no tool
that's going to allow you

463
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,040
to overcome chronic sleep deprivation

464
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,570
and allow you to remain focused,

465
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,830
no pill, no device, no supplement,
no protocol whatsoever.

466
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,990
There are tools to overcome one night

467
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,580
or maybe two nights of sleep deprivation

468
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,050
and we'll talk about those,

469
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,240
but at a fundamental level,

470
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,589
we need to do the things

471
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,219
that modulate our focus and
attention in powerful ways

472
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,200
and sleep really is that thing.

473
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,170
So we've done two episodes,
one called "Master Your Sleep"

474
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,930
and the other episode
is "Perfect Your Sleep."

475
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,762
The "Perfect Your Sleep"

476
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:20,969
is a little bit more like this episode,

477
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,027
more focused on protocols.

478
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:24,450
"Master Your Sleep" includes
protocols and mechanism.

479
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,220
Again, you can find
those at hubermanlab.com.

480
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,020
We also have a sleep toolkit,

481
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,430
a distilled list of things to do

482
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,613
in order to optimize your sleep.

483
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:32,820
I highly recommend that you download that.

484
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,050
You can go to hubermanlab.com,

485
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,180
go to the Neural Network
Newsletter, it is listed there.

486
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,680
If you want you can sign
up for the newsletter,

487
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,580
but you don't have to,

488
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,100
you can simply download
the PDF of that toolkit

489
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
for zero cost.

490
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,960
Why do I say sleep modulates
focus and attention?

491
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,910
Well, I'll give an analogy.

492
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,820
If right now someone pulled
a fire alarm in this building

493
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,140
or if we had a fire in this building,

494
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,120
my attention would drift,

495
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,030
it would not be on recording this podcast,

496
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,810
it would be on something else.

497
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,110
But would I say that the fire
alarm mediates attention?

498
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,510
I mean fire alarms are not
really involved in attention.

499
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,660
No, rather they modulate my attention.

500
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,910
The noise in the room
modulates my attention.

501
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,320
That's quite a bit different

502
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,640
than a tool that I'll provide later

503
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,230
and I'll just give you
a little hint of now,

504
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,580
in fact, I'll give it to you now,

505
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,700
which is that 40 HZ binaural beats

506
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,040
have been shown in a number
of peer reviewed studies

507
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,410
to increase focus and concentration.

508
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,350
And if you'd like to
access 40 HZ binaural beats

509
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,750
in order to improve your
focus and concentration,

510
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,180
you can do that, you can
actually get it at zero cost.

511
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,220
You can go into the app store,

512
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,020
for instance, the Apple App Store,

513
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,670
this is also available for Android phone,

514
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,200
there's an app called BrainWave,

515
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,570
and you can go there,
you can dial in 40 HZ

516
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,490
and it'll play these binaural beats.

517
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,920
It's been shown in multiple
quality peer reviewed studies

518
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,260
that playing a pattern of
sound waves to one ear,

519
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,310
do, do, do, do, do,

520
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,650
and the other ear, which is
slightly offset in frequency,

521
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,030
meaning not quite the same frequencies,

522
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,590
so more like do, do, do, do,

523
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,240
that that combination of frequencies

524
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,340
played to the different ears,

525
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,310
actually get integrated
within deep brain centers

526
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,440
and can increase focus and concentration

527
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,990
in part by increasing levels

528
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,360
of the neurochemical
dopamine and acetylcholine,

529
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,740
which we talked about a little bit earlier

530
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,900
in this arrow model of focus.

531
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,870
So we'll provide a link to that app,

532
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,900
I don't have any relationship
to that app I should mention,

533
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,770
but it's an excellent one,

534
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,150
it's one that I've used for many years.

535
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,580
There are also additional
functions within the app,

536
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,680
such as for sleep and for other things,

537
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,420
but the 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z
is the way it reads out,

538
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,830
40 HZ stimulation

539
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,470
has been shown to improve
focus and concentration.

540
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,600
Here is my recommendation
and the way that I use it.

541
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,330
I would not use 40 HZ binaural beats

542
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,640
every time I'm doing a about of work.

543
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,473
What I tend to do

544
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:43,050
is use it for about five
minutes prior to that work

545
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,150
and then turn it off and then do the work

546
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,790
and I'll talk about other
tools to use during that work,

547
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,990
whether or not it's reading or math

548
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,330
or even just emailing or
something where I require

549
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,059
a bunch of focus for a while.

550
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,340
However, there are times
in which I'm in an area

551
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,390
or I'm in a state of mind

552
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,620
where I'm feeling very distractable

553
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,660
and then I'll keep the
40 HZ binaural beats on

554
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,740
the entire time

555
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,260
I'm doing that about of cognitive work.

556
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,360
I'll also sometimes use
the 40 HZ binaural beats

557
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,410
prior to a workout,

558
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,400
in particular weight workouts,

559
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,870
where I really want to be able to focus on

560
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,490
and contract specific muscles.

561
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,990
So it's a very useful tool,

562
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,630
again, supported by quality
peer reviewed science,

563
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,530
zero cost,

564
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,750
available out there not
just in the BrainWave app

565
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,520
but in multiple apps.

566
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,628
I think many of you will benefit from it.

567
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:25,320
Some of you might not
experience it immediately

568
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,410
as a total dropping into a tunnel of focus

569
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,670
in the same way that you might

570
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,310
with say the sorts of neurochemicals

571
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,180
that we'll talk about later,

572
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,310
like Alpha-GPC and some
of these other things

573
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,590
that change neurochemicals directly,

574
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,990
but nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats

575
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,340
are a very powerful tool,

576
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,590
again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool

577
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,450
that tap into your own endogenous,

578
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,050
meaning within you or
exists within you physiology

579
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,640
in order to increase acetylcholine

580
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,960
and some other neurochemicals

581
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,600
and they have been shown
to work quite well.

582
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,670
Okay so assuming that
you are sleeping well

583
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,020
80% of the nights of your life

584
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,740
or at least working on the
various protocols and tools

585
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,530
to sleep well and sufficiently long

586
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,480
80% of the nights of your life,

587
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,420
and you are interested in additional tools

588
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,040
that are sound based

589
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,460
in order to improve your ability
to concentrate and focus,

590
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,730
there are quality peer reviewed
studies supporting the idea

591
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,310
that white noise or pink noise,

592
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,143
and believe it or not,

593
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:22,110
there is something called pink noise,

594
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,200
it has to do with the
specific frequencies of sound

595
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,236
that are in the noise,

596
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,340
well white noise and pink noise

597
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,360
have been shown to not
improve concentration per se,

598
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,980
but to improve people's ability

599
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,890
to transition into concentrated states.

600
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,050
So I don't tend to use
white noise and pink noise

601
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,390
while I work, but I know a
number of people that do.

602
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,737
I know people that also use
what's called brown noise.

603
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,020
The folks I know

604
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,510
from the engineering and
computer science side

605
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,830
get really into these details

606
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,660
of white noise, pink noise, brown noise.

607
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,120
You can find white noise,
pink noise or brown noise

608
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,270
and listen to it through
headphones or in the room.

609
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,610
There is indeed some data

610
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,500
to support the fact that white noise,

611
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,570
and to some extent, pink
noise and brown noise

612
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,640
can support the release of
particular neurochemicals,

613
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,270
but more data showing that
they can amplify the activity

614
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,910
of neurons in the so-called
prefrontal cortex,

615
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,880
this front area, sort of the
bumper behind your forehead,

616
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,030
that is directly related to your ability

617
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,680
to direct your own focus

618
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,960
and remain focused on certain things.

619
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,970
So you have the option

620
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,550
of either using binaural beats before,

621
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,340
but not during your work,
that is 40 HZ binaural beats,

622
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,990
or 40 HZ binaural beats
throughout your attempt to focus.

623
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,870
You also have the option of
not using binaural beats,

624
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,420
but using white noise,
pink noise or brown noise.

625
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,490
Again, there are a lot of zero cost apps,

626
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,190
you can find also white noise,
pink noise and brown noise

627
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,330
on YouTube.

628
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,560
Again, these are tools

629
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,680
that really have been shown
over and over in humans

630
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,200
to allow people to focus with more depth

631
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,530
and to decrease the
transition time into focus.

632
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,610
This is a really key point.

633
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,050
A lot of people are challenged

634
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,296
with getting into a mode of focus.

635
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,910
None of us, however, should be expected

636
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,760
to just sit down and drop
directly into a state of focus.

637
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,600
I think that's completely an
unfair request of ourselves.

638
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,433
I mean, for instance,

639
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,480
you wouldn't expect yourself
to go out on the track

640
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,250
or go out for a run and not warm up.

641
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,360
You might jog for a few minutes

642
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,860
or even walk before you would jog

643
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,390
and then jog before you would run,

644
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,010
right, I would hope you would do that.

645
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,750
And if you're doing resistance training,

646
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,790
I doubt that you go over and
load up the bar or the machine

647
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,380
with the maximum amount of
weight that you can move

648
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,280
and then just drop right into that,

649
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,150
you always do a warmup.

650
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,100
And I think it's very
important to understand

651
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,780
mental work, focus and concentration

652
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,640
as requiring that warmup.

653
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,140
What is that warmup?

654
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,360
Well, you know what that warmup is.

655
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,150
That warmup is the ramping up

656
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,500
or the increase of
epinephrine, adrenaline,

657
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,930
acetylcholine, and dopamine.

658
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,610
Right, the way that neurochemicals work

659
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,500
is we don't just get to
flip switches in our brain

660
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,150
because we decide to, that's a fantasy.

661
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,160
That's sort of the "Limitless" movie

662
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,320
or movies and ideas

663
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,000
that suddenly you're going
to flip a switch on your arm

664
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,830
and all of a sudden you're
going to be in a laser focus,

665
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,410
that is just not the way that
your nervous system works.

666
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,810
There's a gradual dropping into any state,

667
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,070
whether or not that state is sleep,

668
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,750
right, you go from shallow
sleep to deep sleep

669
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,052
and then out eventually.

670
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:11,850
Focus too, you go from shallow focus

671
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,740
to increasingly deep focus.

672
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,690
That is, in our metaphor of
the arrow, it's very broad,

673
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,800
it's pointed at a lot of things.

674
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,510
And over time as we drop into focus,

675
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,210
that arrow is narrowing and
narrowing and narrowing.

676
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,820
In fact, probably better
to think about it narrowing

677
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,909
and then sometimes oscillating
and getting wider again.

678
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:31,740
We might hear something down the hallway

679
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,230
or more typically our phone
will buzz or we'll think,

680
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,520
oh, I wonder what so and so is doing

681
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,620
or I had to contact them about something.

682
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,900
Your focus is dynamic,

683
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,700
it is not what we call a step function.

684
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,590
It's not like you go
from unfocused to focused

685
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,900
and then you drop into your maximal focus.

686
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,060
By understanding that it's dynamic,

687
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,310
by understanding that you
are going to be continually

688
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,360
going in and out

689
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,526
of progressively but
varying levels of focus,

690
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:58,890
you will greatly release
the pressure on yourself

691
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,160
to feel focused all the
time when you want to be.

692
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,993
This is very key.

693
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:05,520
People who are very good
at focusing understand this

694
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,270
and understand that they
can't expect themselves

695
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,560
to just immediately focus

696
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,050
and then snap into or out of focus.

697
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,640
Okay so be patient with yourself

698
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,820
and also understand that
focus is an ability,

699
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,920
that you can improve your ability to focus

700
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,710
by engaging the neural
circuits responsible for focus

701
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,620
repeatedly over time through
so-called neuroplasticity,

702
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,210
the ability of your nervous system

703
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,860
to change in response to experience.

704
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,660
And that has a couple
of different components,

705
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,980
but put very simply,

706
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,680
what we repeat gets etched
into our nervous system

707
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,510
and becomes easier over time.

708
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,990
And the more emotionally important

709
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,670
or vital something feels to us,

710
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,560
the more likely it is to
trigger neuroplasticity.

711
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,520
We're going to talk a little bit more

712
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,620
about how to increase neural
circuits for focus later,

713
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,330
but right now, what you have in hand

714
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,920
is the key importance of sleep

715
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,680
and I again will direct
you to hubermanlab.com

716
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,820
and the Neural Network Newsletter

717
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,420
to really work on optimizing your sleep.

718
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,080
We've also got two
auditory sound based tools

719
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,920
for improving focus,

720
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,010
there's 40 HZ binaural
beats used before or during

721
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,600
bouts of focus and concentration.

722
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,300
And if you don't like
those, or even if you do,

723
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,410
you might alternate them with

724
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,050
or occasionally use white noise,
pink noise or brown noise,

725
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,240
also readily available at zero cost.

726
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,300
A question I often get is how
long should I try to focus?

727
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,820
Well, the research literature
point to the key importance

728
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,530
of so-called ultradian cycles.

729
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,290
You've all probably
heard of circadian cycles

730
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,160
or circadian biology,
circa, the day, circadian,

731
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,720
is about 24 hour cycle.

732
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,810
Well, our brain and body
operate within that day

733
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,160
or within each and every day I should say

734
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,360
with 90 minute ultradian cycles.

735
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,650
So my suggestion would be

736
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,440
anytime you're going to
sit down and try and focus

737
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,520
or you're going to try
and do a focused about

738
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,670
of physical exercise or skill
learning or musical learning,

739
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,320
or maybe you're even just
having a conversation,

740
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,280
maybe you're a therapist

741
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,020
or you're attending therapy or a class,

742
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,130
how long should it be?

743
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,010
And the ideal duration
is about 90 minutes,

744
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,570
not exactly 90 minutes,

745
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,750
but we can reliably
say 90 minutes or less,

746
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,850
okay, it doesn't have to
be the full 90 minutes.

747
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,460
But trying to push yourself
to be able to drop into

748
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,560
two hours of focus or
three hours of focus,

749
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,190
while possible is not really in line

750
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,230
with what we know about
the underlying biology.

751
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,090
Everything from our sleep states

752
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,820
or the different stages of
sleep and our waking states

753
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,070
is divided into these 90 minute cycles

754
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,510
or so-called ultradian cycles.

755
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,210
So what I like to do is
set a timer for 90 minutes.

756
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,190
I acknowledge and accept the fact

757
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,900
that under most conditions

758
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,970
unless I'm really pressed for a deadline

759
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,130
and I'm optimally caffeinated, et cetera,

760
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,620
the first five to 10
minutes of that 90 minutes

761
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,110
are a transition time, it's
like the warm up for focus,

762
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,090
but I do include it in that 90 minutes.

763
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,054
And then I really try and drop into

764
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:44,490
doing focused mental work
or learning of some sort,

765
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,130
again, this could be physical
as well, motor skill learning

766
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,680
or anything, we're running or
lifting weights, et cetera,

767
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,270
and really try and drop into that

768
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,530
across the full 90 minutes,

769
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,630
again accepting the fact,

770
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,770
okay it's not just an idea,

771
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,800
the fact that occasionally
our focus will flicker,

772
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,120
it will jump out of focus,

773
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,670
and then a big part of being able to focus

774
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,090
is to go back to focusing.

775
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,400
The way I'd like you to
conceptualize this perhaps

776
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,830
is that arrowhead suddenly
getting very, very broad,

777
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,090
that you're focusing on many things

778
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,913
or that arrow shifts to a
different location in the room.

779
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:14,220
The key is to be able to shift it back

780
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,927
and to narrow it once again
and that's an active process,

781
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:20,340
so much so that it requires
a lot of metabolic energy,

782
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,113
your brain is the chief
consumer of metabolic energy.

783
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:26,607
The calories that you consume,

784
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,170
the so-called basal metabolic rate,

785
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,250
most of that isn't related

786
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,690
to movement or heartbeat or breathing,

787
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,520
it's related to brain function.

788
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,880
Your brain is a glutton with
respect to caloric need.

789
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,800
So understand that at
the end of 90 minutes

790
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,390
or maybe even after 45 minutes,

791
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,090
you might feel rather
tired or even exhausted.

792
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,150
And it's very important
that after a about of focus

793
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,890
that you take at least 10 minutes

794
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,960
and ideally as long as 30 minutes

795
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,600
and go through what I
call deliberate defocus.

796
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,210
You really want to focus
on somewhat menial tasks

797
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,800
or things that really don't require

798
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,489
a ton of your concentration.

799
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:58,920
This is starting to become

800
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,540
a little bit of a movement out there

801
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,990
in the kind of pop psychology
and optimization world,

802
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,240
this idea of not looking at your phone

803
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,590
as you walk down the hall to the bathroom,

804
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,120
certainly not looking at
your phone in the bathroom.

805
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,500
And I should mention, by the way,

806
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,690
this is a particular annoyance of mine,

807
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,880
have you noticed that wait times

808
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,320
for restrooms in public places

809
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,810
has increased substantially
in the last 10 years?

810
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,630
The reason for that is
not digestive, okay,

811
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,160
it's not the gut microbiome,

812
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,660
I mean it might be the gut microbiome,

813
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,493
but chances are

814
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:27,030
it's because people are on
their phones in the bathroom.

815
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,030
So you're doing yourself
and everybody else a favor

816
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,460
by staying off your phone in the restroom,

817
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,340
staying off your phone
while walking down the hall.

818
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,430
Try and give yourself some time
to deliberately decompress,

819
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,190
to let your mental states idle,

820
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,050
to not be focused on any one thing.

821
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,150
That period of idling

822
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,400
is essential for your ability to focus,

823
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,233
much in the same way

824
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,760
that rest between sets
of resistance training

825
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,560
or rest between exercise

826
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,230
is vital to being able
to focus and perform

827
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,780
during the actual sets or
during the actual bouts

828
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,190
of running or cycling

829
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,220
or whatever your particular
form of exercise might be.

830
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,350
So deliberate decompression is key.

831
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,780
And I know this is hard because
we're all being drawn in

832
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,170
by the incredible rich array

833
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,640
of sensory information available

834
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,500
on our phones and other devices,

835
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,390
but I can't emphasize this enough,

836
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,940
our ability to focus is not just related

837
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,820
to what happens during
the entry and movement

838
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,760
through those focused bouts
but after those focused bouts.

839
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,530
We really need to deliberately decompress.

840
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,300
And of course, the ultimate decompress,

841
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,830
the time in which we are not directing

842
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,840
our thinking interaction is during sleep.

843
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,250
And so it's no wonder,

844
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,230
or I should say it holds
together logically,

845
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,440
that that deep, long lasting duration

846
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,960
of not controlling where our mind is at

847
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,480
is in fact the ultimate
form of restoration,

848
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,310
even if we have very intense dreams.

849
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,730
So take that period after each
90 minute or less focus about,

850
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,840
right, remember those focus bouts

851
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,160
don't have to be full 90 minutes,

852
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,870
let's say you do 45 minutes of work,

853
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,703
you're just done with it,

854
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:55,320
set it down and go do
something for maybe five, 10,

855
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,907
maybe even 30 minutes that
is functional for your day,

856
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:00,960
right, not just walking around in circles

857
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,860
or staring up at the sky

858
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,690
although if you can do that, do that,

859
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,250
but most of us have other things to do,

860
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,900
but do things that are rather automatic

861
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,040
or reflexive for you,

862
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,440
and try not to do any focused reading,

863
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,260
try not to bring your vision
into a tight location,

864
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,410
such as your phone and try
and deliberately decompress,

865
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,700
because that will allow you

866
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,190
to drop into intense spouts of focus

867
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,620
again repeatedly and
repeatedly throughout the day.

868
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,140
I'm often asked how many ultradian cycles

869
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,760
one can perform throughout the day?

870
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,740
That depends on how well you've slept,

871
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,880
how well you are nourished,

872
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,350
which we'll talk about in a moment,

873
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,530
and how well trained up
your focus capacity is.

874
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,714
And here's the paradox,

875
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:39,540
if you are very trained at focusing,

876
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,610
if you're very good at
dropping into focus,

877
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,780
you're actually going to need

878
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,967
more deliberate decompression and defocus

879
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:47,400
and I recommend only doing about two,

880
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,090
maybe three deep work sessions per day.

881
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,120
So not one 90 minute session
than expecting yourself

882
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,920
to do to another one and
another one, another one,

883
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,350
but rather one deep
work 90 minute session,

884
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,090
and maybe another in the afternoon.

885
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,837
A lot of people get
surprised by this and say,

886
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,360
"Wait, how many people can afford

887
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,650
to just work three hours a day?"

888
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,090
I'm not saying just
work three hours a day.

889
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm really talking about
the hard mental work.

890
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,764
And again, somewhat paradoxically,

891
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,600
the more you can concentrate,

892
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
the more deeply you can concentrate,

893
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,860
the fewer deep work concentration bouts

894
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,330
you can actually perform each day.

895
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,460
This makes sense, however,

896
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,570
if you think about it in the context

897
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,620
of say resistance training.

898
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,380
If you are stronger and
stronger in the gym,

899
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,730
or you're an endurance athlete

900
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,540
and you can run ultra-marathons,
100 miles or so,

901
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,750
you are essentially cutting a deeper cut

902
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,000
into your recovery capacity

903
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,250
than somebody who's not
very skilled at those things

904
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,710
or can't perform as much intense work.

905
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,560
So the intensity of the
work scales directly

906
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,744
with how long you need
to rest after that work.

907
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:48,240
I at this stage of my life am pretty good

908
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,530
at dropping into

909
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,804
and maintaining focused
bouts of concentration

910
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,340
provided the landscape
of my life is right,

911
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,590
you know, I don't have some
burning stressful thing

912
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,020
that's essential or an
emergency that I'm tending to

913
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,330
and that I put my phone
away or turn it off,

914
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,900
I can do three 90 minute
focus bouts per day,

915
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,920
but that's about it.

916
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,900
And then in between those focus bouts,

917
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,270
I'm doing other things
that require less focus.

918
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,160
Some of you may be able to perform four.

919
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,180
What I highly recommend

920
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,675
is that you try doing at least one,

921
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:17,712
that is one 90 minute or less

922
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:21,480
about of focused
concentrated work per day,

923
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,070
and yes, that means the weekends too.

924
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,737
And on the weekends, I like to read a book

925
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:27,510
with my phone nowhere in
sight, not on a device,

926
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,330
that's what I do or I'll listen
to an audiobook sometimes

927
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,320
while taking a walk,

928
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,692
but really concentrating on
what I'm trying to learn,

929
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,910
what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing.

930
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,090
So again, a daily 90 minute
about is one to start with

931
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,800
and I would say after
about four weeks of that,

932
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,937
if you're able to stay concentrated

933
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,440
and work through the agitation,

934
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,590
then I would consider increasing
the number of focus bouts.

935
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,643
Again, this is not to say

936
00:33:47,643 --> 00:33:49,410
that you should go to your teacher

937
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,687
or your PhD advisor or your
parent or your friends and say,

938
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:55,110
"Listen, I can't really
concentrate or think about anything

939
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,730
for more than 90 minutes per day."

940
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:57,570
That's not what I'm saying.

941
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,890
These are deep focus bouts.

942
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,660
These are bouts of work,

943
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,300
or I should say mental
work or physical work

944
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,150
where you're really forcing
yourself to focus and refocus,

945
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,860
to sharpen the head of that arrowhead,

946
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,929
to redirect it to what you're
trying to concentrate on,

947
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,459
and it is indeed hard work.

948
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,600
I would even think about it

949
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,179
more or less like a workout of any kind.

950
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,919
Before we continue with
today's discussion,

951
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,510
we're going to take a brief pause

952
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,030
to acknowledge our
sponsor Athletic Greens,

953
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,770
also called AG1.

954
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,100
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012

955
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,929
so I'm delighted that
they've been a sponsor

956
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,489
of this podcast.

957
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:32,339
Athletic Greens contains
vitamins, minerals, probiotics,

958
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,790
digestive enzymes, and adaptogens,

959
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,087
so it's got a lot of things in there

960
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,827
and that's actually the
reason I started taking it

961
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,489
and the reason I still take
it once or twice a day.

962
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,959
It essentially covers all
of my nutritional bases

963
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,030
and the probiotics in
particular are important to me

964
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,380
because of the critical importance

965
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,969
of what's called the gut brain axis,

966
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,209
that is neurons and other
cell types in the gut,

967
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,760
in the digestive tract that
communicate with the brain

968
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,010
and the brain back to the digestive tract

969
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,400
in order to control things
like mood, immune function,

970
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,380
hormone function, and on and on.

971
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,820
Whenever somebody has asked me,

972
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,980
what's the one supplement
they should take,

973
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,630
I always answer Athletic Greens.

974
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,030
I gave that answer long
before I ever had this podcast

975
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,770
and it's the answer I still give now

976
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,560
for all the reasons that I
detailed just a moment ago.

977
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,940
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

978
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,820
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

979
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,930
to claim a special offer.

980
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,340
They'll give you five free travel packs

981
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,110
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

982
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,100
while you're on the road,

983
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,920
plus a year supply of vitamin D3+K2,

984
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,970
which are also very important

985
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,240
for a huge number of bodily
factors and brain factors

986
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,130
that impact your immediate
and long-term health.

987
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,770
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

988
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,330
to claim that special offer.

989
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,320
I'd like to call your attention

990
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,450
to a new and extremely useful tool

991
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,090
for learning and applying
science based protocols

992
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,460
for mental health, physical
health and performance.

993
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,390
It's called Virtusan,
v-i-r-t-u-s-a-n, and it's an app.

994
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,180
And inside the app, you'll
find what are called journeys.

995
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,550
Each journey is aimed at a specific goal,

996
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,730
such as improving your
sleep or tracking your sleep

997
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,910
or improving your ability
to focus and concentrate

998
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,590
or improving your nutrition
or specific exercise programs.

999
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,020
The Virtusan app makes
a lot of the protocols

1000
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,853
that you've seen here

1001
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:10,110
on the Huberman Lab Podcast and elsewhere

1002
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,020
very easy to understand
and access and practice.

1003
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,060
And in fact, it tracks your progress

1004
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,710
with each of these protocols.

1005
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,240
I and several other researchers

1006
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,560
have been directly involved

1007
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,020
in developing the specific
journeys and protocols

1008
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,790
that you'll find within the Virtusan app.

1009
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,150
In fact, a lot of it involves
direct video tutorials from me

1010
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,560
and others that you'll recognize

1011
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,540
from social media and from podcasts.

1012
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,700
Everything that you'll find
within the Virtusan app

1013
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,800
is geared towards giving
you the latest science

1014
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,170
in simple, straightforward protocols

1015
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,510
to allow you to improve your
mental health, physical health

1016
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,552
and performance.

1017
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:41,730
If you want check it out,

1018
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,250
you can go to the App
Store under Virtusan,

1019
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,070
again, that's spelled v-i-r-t-u-s-a-n,

1020
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,550
or you can go to virtusan.com/huberman.

1021
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,250
Again, that's virtusan.com/huberman.

1022
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,920
I mentioned the topic of
nutrition a little bit ago,

1023
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,080
and of course, nutrition
is a complicated topic.

1024
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,430
In fact, one of the quickest ways

1025
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,530
to get yourself into a battle online

1026
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,900
is to say something
definitive about nutrition.

1027
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,330
I just want to clearly state
my stance about nutrition.

1028
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,920
I fully support and applaud

1029
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,720
those of you that are
vegans for whatever reason,

1030
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,910
those of you that are pure
carnivore for whatever reason,

1031
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,040
and those of you that are
omnivores for whatever reason.

1032
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,390
I happen to be an omnivore.

1033
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,250
My goal is always to eat high quality,

1034
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,140
minimally or non-processed foods

1035
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,400
and to eat things in moderation.

1036
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,960
So I do eat some meat

1037
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,720
from sustainable sources
or from organic sources,

1038
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,900
I eat some starches and I eat
vegetables and I eat fruits,

1039
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,220
I try not to eat sugars

1040
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,780
and I don't really like
highly processed foods

1041
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,800
at this point in my life.

1042
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
That's me, that's what I do,

1043
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,340
but I'm certainly not dictating
what people should eat.

1044
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,960
I know certain people are ketogenic,

1045
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,050
and I can say that for
people who achieve ketosis

1046
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,280
and can get into ketosis,

1047
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,820
yes indeed, there is a mental
state associated with ketosis

1048
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,770
that will allow your brain to function

1049
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,060
and to think really clearly

1050
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,860
that many people find very attractive

1051
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,140
and keep them going
back over and over again

1052
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,430
to a ketogenic diet.

1053
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,130
I'm somebody who for instance
has not been in ketosis

1054
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,030
many times in my life,

1055
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,680
at least not deliberately so,

1056
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,350
but I actually will ingest
liquid ketones from time to time

1057
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,690
because of the further
cognitive enhancement

1058
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,310
and physical enhancement that I experience

1059
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,730
on top of nutrition that does
include some carbohydrates.

1060
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,100
So there are a lot of different
ways to approach all this,

1061
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,810
whether or not you're a vegan, omnivore,

1062
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,171
vegetarian, carnivore, et
cetera, the point is this,

1063
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,760
your ability to focus,

1064
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,650
and in fact, your ability of neurons

1065
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,470
to encode specific information
in your environment,

1066
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,140
that is to represent what's
out there in the world,

1067
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,080
is actually related to
your blood glucose level.

1068
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,720
Now here I'm setting aside the discussion

1069
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,870
of ketosis and ketogenic
diets for the moment,

1070
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,890
but there's a beautiful study

1071
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,450
that was published in Neuron not long ago

1072
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,500
that showed that the tuning,

1073
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,350
that is the precision with
which neurons in the brain

1074
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,390
will represent things in our environment

1075
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,730
is actually much greater

1076
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,040
when there is sufficient
glucose in the brain.

1077
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,070
Translated into English, this
means that when we are fasted

1078
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,020
or when our blood glucose is very low,

1079
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,840
we aren't able to perceive
and think about things

1080
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,040
as clearly.

1081
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,720
Now there's a twist to this, however.

1082
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,820
Many people who practice
intermittent fasting,

1083
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,653
and I should say

1084
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:02,430
I practice a sort of pseudo
intermittent fasting,

1085
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,630
I generally eat my meals

1086
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,850
between the hours of 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM

1087
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,890
although sometimes there's
some wiggle around that,

1088
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,270
occasionally have an early breakfast,

1089
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,710
I'm not super rigid about it,

1090
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,030
but I know there are a number of people

1091
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,260
who are doing longer fasts

1092
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,108
or they're eating in a six hour window.

1093
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:17,850
We did an entire episode about fasting,

1094
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,980
you can again find that
at hubermanlab.com,

1095
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,750
we'll likely have Satchin Panda,

1096
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,810
who's an expert in intermittent
fasting, on the podcast.

1097
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,250
Intermittent fasting

1098
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,608
has a lot of different potential benefits.

1099
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:29,610
For some people,

1100
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,470
it's a convenient way to
restrict their calories.

1101
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,660
For other people, it's a
convenient way to avoid eating,

1102
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,300
that is it's easier to not eat
than to eat a small portion

1103
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,870
so they opt for intermittent
fasting and so on and so forth.

1104
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,730
But one of the things
that you hear very often

1105
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,440
is that some people like being fasted

1106
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,740
because they like the clarity
of mind that it provides.

1107
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,060
Here's the situation.

1108
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,010
Neurons, unless you're
in a ketogenic diet,

1109
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,130
really thrive on glucose,
they love glucose.

1110
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,690
And as I mentioned before,

1111
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,520
your ability to think and perceive things

1112
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,870
is actually enhanced

1113
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,060
by having sufficient
glucose in your bloodstream.

1114
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,460
So why would it be that
some people experience

1115
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,100
a heightened state of mental
clarity when they are fasted?

1116
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,572
I've certainly experienced that before.

1117
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:07,500
Well, I should say

1118
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,540
that provided you're well hydrated enough

1119
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,490
and you have enough
electrolytes in your system,

1120
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,130
what tends to happen is
that when you ingest food,

1121
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,660
there's a shift in your nervous system

1122
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,700
towards so-called parasympathetic mode,

1123
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,200
that is the more relaxed,

1124
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,790
you've probably heard
it as rest and digest,

1125
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,623
although it does other things,

1126
00:40:21,623 --> 00:40:24,540
the more relaxed mode that can
indeed make us very sleepy.

1127
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,830
If we have too many carbohydrates,

1128
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,450
it actually can make us quite sleepy.

1129
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,730
However, if we have any food,

1130
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,140
if we have enough of it,

1131
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,760
that is if our gut is full,

1132
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,050
it diverts blood to our gut

1133
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,450
and we become sleepy and
we can't focus as well.

1134
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,400
So a lot of people really like fasting

1135
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,700
and the state of being fasted
for focus and concentration

1136
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,980
because they don't have as much

1137
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,930
of that parasympathetic activation,

1138
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,950
they're just not as sleepy.

1139
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,570
And in fact, under those conditions,

1140
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,330
half as much caffeine will
give you just as much lift

1141
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,490
as twice as much caffeine will give you

1142
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,720
on a full belly of pasta

1143
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,520
and that's just the way
that caffeine interacts

1144
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,360
with blood glucose.

1145
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,920
So what I'd like you to imagine

1146
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,310
is if you had a measure
of focus from zero to 10,

1147
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,420
these are arbitrary units,

1148
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,800
10 being maximally focused

1149
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,960
and zero being not focused at all,

1150
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,020
imagine a U-shaped function, right,

1151
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,850
where if you're very fasted,

1152
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,850
you're going to have high degree
of focus and concentration,

1153
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,340
but then if you ingest some
food and your belly is full,

1154
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,680
your focus and concentration is reduced.

1155
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,916
But having enough blood glucose

1156
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,360
and maybe even elevated blood glucose

1157
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,830
will increase cognitive function.

1158
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,060
So there are two ends of the spectrum.

1159
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,320
On one end of the spectrum,

1160
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,140
blood glucose is relatively
low and you're fasted

1161
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,680
and you can think and behave
in a very concentrated way

1162
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,300
and on the other end of the spectrum,

1163
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,160
you have a lot of blood
glucose, or I should say,

1164
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,150
sufficient blood glucose,

1165
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,460
you never want your blood
glucose to be too high,

1166
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,210
and that allows your neurons
to encode and perceive

1167
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,430
and basically allow you
to think really clearly.

1168
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,500
So you sort of have to
pick your condition.

1169
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,800
What do you want for your bouts
of focus and concentration?

1170
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,820
I actually do both.

1171
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,350
So what I do is, as I mentioned before,

1172
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,330
I eat my meal sometime around 11:00 AM,

1173
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,470
my first meal typically

1174
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,060
unless I'm very hungry when I wake up.

1175
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,600
And so I will do my workout
and one about of focused work.

1176
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,530
I always think of this as my
hard work early in the day

1177
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,940
and I do that fasted,

1178
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,220
I'll be consuming water with electrolytes,

1179
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,660
maybe LMNT or other electrolytes,

1180
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,960
maybe some caffeine as well
in the form of yerba mate

1181
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,340
or coffee, that's my first focus
about of 90 minutes or less,

1182
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,860
that is essentially done
fasted and then I'll eat

1183
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,720
and then I do notice after I eat,

1184
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
I actually have a diminished
capacity to focus.

1185
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,230
But then again in the afternoon,

1186
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,180
I will do another 90
minute about of focus,

1187
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,710
and I'll talk about
some of the tools I use

1188
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,110
to make sure that that
about of focus is optimal

1189
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,440
for getting the most amount
of focused work done,

1190
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,330
whether or not it's mental
work or physical work,

1191
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,337
although I tend to do my
physical work early in the day

1192
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:44,550
and my mental work both
early and late in the day.

1193
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,330
So to make this very simple
or as simple as I can for you

1194
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:52,050
being fasted is great for
focus and concentration

1195
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,140
provided you're not thinking
about food the entire time

1196
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,040
and being fed is terrific
for focus and concentration,

1197
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,540
it actually can improve neuronal function

1198
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,970
provided that you didn't
eat too much food.

1199
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,980
So one way to manage this

1200
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,240
is if you're going to have a lunch,

1201
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,370
to make sure that you don't
stuff yourself at lunch,

1202
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,730
that you're not overeating
and to not get quite so full

1203
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,680
that you put your nervous system

1204
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,180
into this parasympathetic mode

1205
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,250
and make it hard to
focus in the afternoon.

1206
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,600
I know a lot of people experience a dip

1207
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,340
or even a crash in energy in the afternoon

1208
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,900
that make it really hard to focus.

1209
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,360
For that reason, I'll just remind people

1210
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,282
of a tool I've talked
about many times before,

1211
00:43:25,282 --> 00:43:26,760
which is based on the biology

1212
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,590
of adenosine and caffeine, et cetera,

1213
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,110
which is to delay your
first caffeine intake

1214
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,660
to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.

1215
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,386
I know that can be painful
for certain people.

1216
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:36,870
I violate that rule,

1217
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,790
when I'm working out very
early in the morning.

1218
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,922
I'll drink my caffeine before my workout

1219
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:45,210
which often occurs within
30 to 60 minutes of waking.

1220
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,940
But in general, unless I'm
working out very early,

1221
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:52,500
I will ingest my caffeine 90
to 120 minutes after I wake up.

1222
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,880
So again, I want to emphasize

1223
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,160
that if you hear somebody out there say

1224
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,640
being fasted is optimal for
focus and concentration.

1225
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,220
Well, that is true in one context

1226
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,800
and perhaps ideal for a
certain part of the day.

1227
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,980
And other people will say,
no, neurons run on glucose,

1228
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,870
you need glucose in your bloodstream

1229
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,390
in order to get those neurons to be tuned,

1230
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,520
that is to respond with
electrical activity

1231
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,950
in the optimal way when
you're reading something

1232
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,210
or when you're trying to perform exercise.

1233
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:19,290
Well, that's also true.

1234
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,330
And of course, you can incorporate both.

1235
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,790
I, in fact as I just described,

1236
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,090
incorporate both fasted
states and fed states

1237
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,063
in order to optimize my
concentration and focus.

1238
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,210
And as a brief note about ketosis,

1239
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,770
for those of you that actually managed

1240
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,210
to transition into ketosis

1241
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,640
and are maintaining a ketogenic state,

1242
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,680
that, as I mentioned earlier,

1243
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,850
can enhance brain function,
concentration and focus

1244
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,460
because of the way in
which ketones can be used

1245
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,850
as a so-called optimal fuel for neurons.

1246
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,210
The ketogenic diet was
originally designed, if you will,

1247
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,470
for epilepsy,

1248
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,000
it has a whole relationship to epilepsy

1249
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,710
and controlling epileptic seizures,

1250
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,990
and it can in fact allow people

1251
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,330
to achieve focus,
concentrated brain states.

1252
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,370
So in the future, I'll do
an episode about ketosis

1253
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,590
and be sure to circle back
on how to optimize ketosis

1254
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,790
for focus and concentration.

1255
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,780
Although I have to believe

1256
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,130
that most of the people listening to this

1257
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,040
are probably not in ketosis
or following a ketogenic diet

1258
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,210
so that's why I mainly focused

1259
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,870
on fasted states and fed states.

1260
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,730
And just to make sure that I'm thorough,

1261
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,050
a fasted state to me

1262
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,230
would be a state in which you
haven't ingested any calories,

1263
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,090
but may have ingested caffeine

1264
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,160
or maybe even a small amount
of artificial sweetener

1265
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,510
or something like that,

1266
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,950
but really haven't ingested

1267
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,690
any significant number of calories

1268
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,870
in the previous four to
eight or maybe even 12 hours.

1269
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,700
And again, there's
tremendous variation here,

1270
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,410
depending on how long people have fasted,

1271
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,670
whether or not we're
talking about the state

1272
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,410
right after people wake up, et cetera.

1273
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,150
Again, if you're interested
in intermittent fasting,

1274
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,530
both for the sake of mental

1275
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,660
and physical health and performance,

1276
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,240
check out our episode on
fasting at hubermanlab.com.

1277
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,160
I also want to touch back on this idea

1278
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,482
of which foods can increase focus.

1279
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:58,410
You know, in the episode
on ADHD that I did,

1280
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,390
I touched on this quite a bit

1281
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,340
as it relates to elimination diets.

1282
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,200
There's a whole industry

1283
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,510
and a ton of interest for obvious reasons

1284
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,970
into what sorts of things kids and adults

1285
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,900
should and shouldn't eat

1286
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,030
in order to reduce symptoms of ADHD.

1287
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,660
I think that the sum total of
those data point to the fact

1288
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,310
that reducing simple sugar intake

1289
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,320
and certainly highly processed foods,

1290
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,020
so ice cream, candy, chips, et cetera,

1291
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,853
those sorts of things,

1292
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:25,170
really does seem to
improve symptoms of ADHD

1293
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,940
in both children and adults.

1294
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,950
But once you move past
that and you start to say,

1295
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,830
well, which foods can improve
concentration and focus?

1296
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,400
Well, foods that for instance
include a lot of tyrosine,

1297
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,870
which is a precursor to dopamine,

1298
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,170
and now you know why dopamine
is important in this context,

1299
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,720
are certainly going to increase
concentration and focus.

1300
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,790
So things like Parmesan cheese,

1301
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,020
certain meats, certain nuts,

1302
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,460
you can look up which foods

1303
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,930
contain high amounts of tyrosine.

1304
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,700
There are also some fruits and vegetables

1305
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,620
that include high amounts of tyrosine,

1306
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,260
but to be quite direct,

1307
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:59,130
it doesn't matter whether or
not you're ingesting foods

1308
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,740
that are rich in the precursor amino acids

1309
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,020
to dopamine, acetylcholine, et cetera,

1310
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,020
if you are consuming large
amounts of those foods.

1311
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,960
That is one can look and see for instance,

1312
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,470
that a steak includes
a lot of the precursors

1313
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,730
to acetylcholine.

1314
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,640
It has amino acid precursors
to dopamine as well

1315
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,530
and there are other foods
that will do that as well,

1316
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,560
but if I were to ingest
say two ribeye steaks,

1317
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,030
that's a lot of meat

1318
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,850
and it will direct a
lot of blood to my gut

1319
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,130
and it will cause me to be sleepy

1320
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,140
and that will create challenges of me

1321
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,990
being able to achieve states
of focus and concentration.

1322
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,570
So the simple way to put
this is if you eat too much

1323
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,670
or you eat a very large volume of food,

1324
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,690
you are going to diminish
your focus and concentration.

1325
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,040
The key is to eat enough

1326
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,560
that you're nourished for
the certain activities,

1327
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,930
mental and physical that
you need to perform,

1328
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,520
but if you're eating large meals,

1329
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,700
you are going to diminish
your concentration and focus

1330
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,533
period.

1331
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:57,150
I know many people are curious
as to whether or not caffeine

1332
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,710
can improve focus and
concentration, and indeed it can.

1333
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,980
There is an immense amount
of data supporting the idea

1334
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,814
that caffeine,

1335
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:08,250
provided its consumed in
the appropriate dosages,

1336
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,160
can improve mental performance
and physical performance,

1337
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,960
and it largely does that

1338
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,388
through improvements in
focus and concentration.

1339
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:18,570
The dosage of caffeine of course,

1340
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,300
is going to depend on how
caffeine adapted you are,

1341
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,490
how much caffeine tolerance you have.

1342
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,795
And that is going to vary tremendously

1343
00:48:25,795 --> 00:48:28,920
depending on whether or not
you ingest that caffeine

1344
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,410
with or without food,
as I mentioned earlier.

1345
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,600
But there is a kind of general range

1346
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,610
in which we can talk about caffeine

1347
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,830
as being useful for
focus and concentration.

1348
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,690
And the range is basically

1349
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,330
from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams.

1350
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,040
I want to caution everybody out there,

1351
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,470
if you're somebody who
suffers from anxiety

1352
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,700
or panic attacks,

1353
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,380
and you're not used to ingesting caffeine

1354
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,920
and you run out and ingest
400 milligrams of caffeine

1355
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,970
in the form of espresso or yerba mate

1356
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,400
or an energy drink or in pill form,

1357
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,410
that is going to be very
uncomfortable for you,

1358
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,880
you're going to be sweating profusely,

1359
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,140
your heart rate is going to increase,

1360
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,080
you're going to be quite panicked in fact

1361
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,460
or at least anxious.

1362
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,210
So be cautious with your
use and adopting of caffeine

1363
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,460
if you're not already caffeine adapted,

1364
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,780
but most people do quite well

1365
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,450
to ingest 100 to 200
milligrams of caffeine

1366
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,640
prior to doing some focused work.

1367
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,310
And again, I recommend
delaying your caffeine intake

1368
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,470
to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,

1369
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,330
unless you're using that caffeine

1370
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,170
to really jolt your
system before a workout.

1371
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,020
Caffeine can of course be
ingested in various forms,

1372
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,040
even pill form,

1373
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,870
but most people ingest
it in the form of coffee

1374
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,480
or my particular favorite
way to ingest caffeine

1375
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,890
is yerba mate.

1376
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,050
It is important and I should note

1377
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,360
that you should actively avoid

1378
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,010
the smoked versions of yerba mate

1379
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,780
as they contain a lot of carcinogenic,

1380
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,400
cancer promoting compounds.

1381
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,887
There's some great yerba
mate brands out there.

1382
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:52,470
The most cost effective way to consume it

1383
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,850
would be to use the loose leaf tea

1384
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,641
and to pour water over that.

1385
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:57,660
There's one particular brand that I like,

1386
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,090
I don't have any affiliation
to them whatsoever,

1387
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,040
but I've been using it
for years, it's Anna Park.

1388
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,490
It's an organic brand that is
sold, I buy mine on Amazon,

1389
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,380
you can find it elsewhere
on the internet as well.

1390
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,030
Again, I don't have any
affiliation to them,

1391
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,710
it's just very cost effective, very clean,

1392
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,570
it doesn't have the smoked flavor,

1393
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,490
at least the one that I buy
is not the smoked variety

1394
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,860
so none of the carcinogenic
compounds are in there

1395
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,190
at least that I'm aware of
and I like the way it tastes

1396
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,530
and it provides a very
even lift and stimulant

1397
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,620
that I think certainly works for me

1398
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,597
and that a number of people I know

1399
00:50:26,597 --> 00:50:29,430
that I have suggested to also enjoy.

1400
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:34,320
Yerba mate or caffeine also
have other additional benefits,

1401
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,010
in particular, the caffeine
in yerba mate and coffee

1402
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,120
and other sources of caffeine

1403
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,300
are known to increase
the density and efficacy,

1404
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,710
that is the number and the
function of dopamine receptors,

1405
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,350
and this has been shown
in humans several times.

1406
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,300
So by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,

1407
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,610
you're actually increasing
the ability of dopamine

1408
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:57,930
to have this effect of
increasing motivation and drive.

1409
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,390
I tend to ingest caffeine
only early in the day,

1410
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,980
I tend to cut off my caffeine intake

1411
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,660
somewhere around one or 2:00 PM

1412
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,820
to ensure that I can get
into a good night's sleep,

1413
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,230
but I realize that there
are people out there

1414
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,130
that ingest caffeine

1415
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,930
as late as two or three in the afternoon

1416
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,340
and can still sleep fine.

1417
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,570
I will caution those of you

1418
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,920
that think that you can drink caffeine

1419
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,063
in the evening or nighttime
and still fall asleep.

1420
00:51:16,063 --> 00:51:18,540
All of the research points to the fact

1421
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,010
that the architecture of your sleep

1422
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,660
and the depth of your sleep is disrupted.

1423
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,330
Even if you're able to
fall and stay asleep,

1424
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,010
the sleep you're getting
is simply not as good

1425
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:26,880
as the sleep you would get

1426
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,191
if you were to shut off
your caffeine intake

1427
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:31,230
at least eight hours before bedtime,

1428
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,960
and ideally more like 10 or
even 12 hours before bedtime.

1429
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,780
But of course, there are
practical constraints as well.

1430
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,010
Okay so caffeine is
increasing dopamine's function

1431
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,939
by changing the number and
efficacy of dopamine receptors,

1432
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:47,130
but of course, it also
increases our wakefulness,

1433
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,270
our alertness,

1434
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,210
and that is largely through
the neurochemical systems

1435
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,530
related to adenosine,

1436
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,660
which is a molecule that
builds up in our brain and body

1437
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,710
the longer we are awake,

1438
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,560
it's part of the sleepiness
system if you will,

1439
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,780
it makes us feel fatigued or tired,

1440
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,160
and caffeine also operates
on the epinephrine,

1441
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,480
the adrenaline system.

1442
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,070
In fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,

1443
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,840
we'll sometimes get the jitters.

1444
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,410
Those jitters are really the
sympathetic, as it's called,

1445
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,750
nervous system's bias toward movement,

1446
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,470
and our pupils will dilate,
they actually get broader.

1447
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,880
Now somewhat paradoxically,
when our pupils get bigger,

1448
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,980
the pupils of our eyes that is,

1449
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,840
our visual world actually narrows,

1450
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,370
it becomes more tunnel-like.

1451
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,300
A lot of people don't realize this.

1452
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,480
When our pupils are really
small, that means we are relaxed.

1453
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,360
So if you ever see someone

1454
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,940
with really tiny or pin size pupils,

1455
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,840
they're very relaxed.

1456
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,270
If their pupils are very
big, they're very dilated,

1457
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:42,000
well then they are very amped up,

1458
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,070
they are very, very alert.

1459
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,400
Caffeine increases alertness
by increasing epinephrine,

1460
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,907
adrenaline release both in
the brain and within the body.

1461
00:52:50,907 --> 00:52:53,190
And so that's another
way that it facilitates

1462
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,244
focus and concentration.

1463
00:52:55,244 --> 00:52:58,110
Now there are other ways
to increase epinephrine

1464
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,990
in the brain and body besides
caffeine or other stimulants,

1465
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:02,880
and in fact, that has been studied.

1466
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,050
There's an excellent study

1467
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:08,100
that was carried out not that
long ago on how stress itself

1468
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,190
can increase our ability
to focus and concentrate,

1469
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,690
that's right how stress itself

1470
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,580
can increase focus and concentration.

1471
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,870
You know, most people think of stress

1472
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,060
as impairing our ability to focus,

1473
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,290
but that's actually not true.

1474
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,230
When we are stressed, it
involves the deployment,

1475
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,630
the release of adrenaline, epinephrine,

1476
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,930
and that that adrenaline both
changes our visual field,

1477
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,700
in other words, it narrows our vision

1478
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,100
to a more tunnel-like focus,

1479
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,990
that is it makes the arrow

1480
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:37,410
in our metaphor of the arrow more sharp,

1481
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,927
and it improves our concentration.

1482
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:42,300
And this makes sense given
what we know about stress.

1483
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,652
When we're stressed,

1484
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:44,485
we tend to be stressed
about a specific thing,

1485
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:46,800
we start anticipating
or wondering or thinking

1486
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,850
about what's going to happen next?

1487
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:48,810
What led up to this?

1488
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,920
How is this going to impact me?

1489
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,360
How do I feel right now?

1490
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,160
It really narrows the context

1491
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,140
of our thinking and our behavior.

1492
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,120
So one of my favorite studies
that really illustrates

1493
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,450
how stress can improve
concentration and performance

1494
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,067
is one that was published
not that long ago

1495
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,560
and I will provide a link
to this in the show notes.

1496
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,880
It's a paper published

1497
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,820
in the "Journal of Experimental
Psychology" in 2020.

1498
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,017
The title of the paper
is, not surprisingly,

1499
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:14,070
"Acute stress improves
concentration performance",

1500
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,300
first author DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e.

1501
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,240
And this study involved
taking a number of subjects

1502
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,520
and stressing them out or not

1503
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,000
prior to a cognitive
or concentration task.

1504
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,650
And there are a lot of data in this paper,

1505
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,740
but I'm just going to hone in
on one specific set of data.

1506
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,270
And I should mention as I go there,

1507
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,820
that they measured things like
cortisol, a stress hormone,

1508
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,850
they measured anxiety, it
was a quite thorough study.

1509
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:42,000
And what they found was that
concentration performance

1510
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,330
improved manyfold, I should say, from,

1511
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,070
there was a greater than doubling

1512
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,460
of concentration and
performance in the stress group.

1513
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,620
And stress in this context was provided

1514
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,200
using a standard way of inducing stress.

1515
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,033
What they basically do

1516
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:58,050
is they bring subjects into the laboratory

1517
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,980
and they have to either do
something fairly mundane

1518
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,150
in the control group

1519
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,390
or they have to do a
simulated job interview,

1520
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,560
an arithmetic task,

1521
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,360
and they're being evaluated
as they're doing this.

1522
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,420
So this isn't intense psychosocial stress.

1523
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,160
They're not watching anything disturbing,

1524
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,990
they're not being traumatized
in any kind of way.

1525
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,390
This is fairly low levels of stress

1526
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,670
that raised their levels of epinephrine,

1527
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,560
and we know this from this study,

1528
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,230
and their levels of cortisol,
another stress hormone,

1529
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,230
modestly within their brain and blood.

1530
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,350
But that even modest increase
in these stress hormones

1531
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:34,590
and their reported
psychological levels of stress

1532
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,186
really enhanced their
focus and concentration.

1533
00:55:37,186 --> 00:55:40,650
This may come as surprising
'cause like many people think,

1534
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,810
gosh, stress really diminishes
cognitive performance,

1535
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,070
but that's absolutely wrong,

1536
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,470
stress improves cognitive performance.

1537
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,350
Now of course there are other
ways to increase stress levels

1538
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,580
and to do that in healthy ways

1539
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,740
to improve concentration and performance

1540
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,840
and one of the best ways to do that

1541
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,050
because it's so sure fire
and it's generally safe

1542
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,680
provided you do it safely
is deliberate cold exposure.

1543
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,410
This is something I've talked
about on the podcast before,

1544
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,270
but deliberate cold
exposure can be achieved

1545
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,330
by getting into a cold shower
for one to five minutes.

1546
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,200
If you're not used to it,

1547
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,970
you probably want to
start with one minute,

1548
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,710
or you can get into an ice bath,

1549
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,030
and nowadays there are
a number of different

1550
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,160
commercial sources of
circulating cold water

1551
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,830
or if you have access
to a body of cold water

1552
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,260
like a lake or a pool or an ocean.

1553
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,310
We know that getting into
cold water or under cold water

1554
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:30,210
greatly increases epinephrine
levels and dopamine levels

1555
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,320
in the brain and blood.

1556
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,910
There's a beautiful
study that was published

1557
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:35,010
in the European Journal of Physiology

1558
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,370
that showed that the increases
in dopamine are massive,

1559
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,960
near doubling or more

1560
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,960
of dopamine levels that are
very long lasting for hours,

1561
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,110
and epinephrine, and
indeed cortisol levels

1562
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,700
are also increased,

1563
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,830
and in ways that support

1564
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:53,607
not just immune system
function because they do that,

1565
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:55,350
and mood because it does that,

1566
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,990
but they can really improve
concentration and focus.

1567
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:01,200
I touched on this a little
bit in an episode about memory

1568
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,960
that there's an age old practice

1569
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,030
really dating back to medieval times

1570
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,550
of putting people into cold water

1571
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,490
right after they learn
something in order to spike,

1572
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:12,780
to increase their epinephrine

1573
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,820
as a way to consolidate those memories.

1574
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,380
For the sake of today's discussion,

1575
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,400
if you are interested

1576
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,190
in ways to improve
focus and concentration,

1577
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,040
you need to increase your epinephrine,

1578
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,930
your adrenaline levels.

1579
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,373
Cold water exposure

1580
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:29,538
is one of the most
efficient ways to do that.

1581
00:57:29,538 --> 00:57:31,620
This is not a biohack.

1582
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,120
I don't like the word hack,

1583
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,380
I know it's commonly used,

1584
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,720
but a hack is something
where you're using one thing

1585
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,880
for a different purpose than
it was originally intended for

1586
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,960
and here, I'm not referring

1587
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,040
to the shower or the cold bath,

1588
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,510
I'm referring to epinephrine.

1589
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,860
Epinephrine is a neurochemical

1590
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,520
that will place your vision
into more of a tunnel mode,

1591
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,540
which will allow you to focus

1592
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,480
on cognitive work or physical
work in a more specific way,

1593
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,070
you're not going to be as distractable,

1594
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,020
and it's very easy to achieve

1595
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,966
by getting into a cold shower
or a cold body of water

1596
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:00,030
for a brief period of time.

1597
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:04,770
People always ask how long to
get under or into cold water

1598
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,940
and how cold to make it.

1599
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,890
Here's the thing, it should
be uncomfortably cold,

1600
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,860
but safe to stay in for
one to five minutes.

1601
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,050
Okay so uncomfortably cold,
you really want to get out,

1602
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:13,883
but safe to stay in,

1603
00:58:13,883 --> 00:58:15,900
not so cold that it's going
to give you a heart attack

1604
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,670
and not so warm that it's comfortable

1605
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,070
that it doesn't create
that adrenaline release.

1606
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,240
Cold water exposure,

1607
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,500
I should say deliberate, cold water

1608
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,671
or non deliberate cold water exposure

1609
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:28,050
reliably increases epinephrine levels.

1610
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,230
It is incredibly useful
as a tool for this,

1611
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:35,850
and it is in fact, zero cost
or even negative zero cost.

1612
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,140
How could it be negative zero cost?

1613
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,210
Well, you can certainly
save on your heating bill

1614
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:41,610
by taking a cold shower so that's one way.

1615
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,160
And for those of you that
have access to devices

1616
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,140
or locations where you
can get into cold water,

1617
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,130
you can submerge,

1618
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,450
well then that can work.

1619
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,848
For those of you that don't,
maybe you take a cold bath,

1620
00:58:50,848 --> 00:58:53,190
you get in up to your neck,
that's going to be most efficient.

1621
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,660
For those of you that can't do that,

1622
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,740
you'll get under a cold shower.

1623
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,370
Again, it should be comfortably cold

1624
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,810
to the point where you want to get out,

1625
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:04,110
but that you can safely stay
in for one to five minutes.

1626
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,030
How long should you do
it before a workout?

1627
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,640
Well, if you get into really cold water,

1628
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,600
it's uncomfortably cold

1629
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,010
and get out after about three minutes,

1630
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,990
you're probably good to go,
dry off and get to work.

1631
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,500
Some of you might think
this is a little bit silly

1632
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,540
as a tool for focus and concentration,

1633
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,600
but if you look at the data on epinephrine

1634
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,120
and how powerfully it can increase focus,

1635
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,040
I think you'd be very impressed.

1636
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,500
I mean it certainly can
increase one's ability

1637
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,300
to attend to specific visual stimuli,

1638
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,700
so for reading or math work, et cetera,

1639
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,140
it's going to be very useful.

1640
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,490
And of course you don't
want to make it so cold

1641
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,800
that you're shivering and
chattering the whole time.

1642
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,510
And of course you could, if you like,

1643
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,310
combine this with 40 HZ binaural beats,

1644
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,143
there's no reason

1645
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:44,070
why you couldn't combine
the two protocols.

1646
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,860
But the point here is that a
lot of people would love to

1647
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,690
and I think ought to leverage

1648
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,330
the health promoting and powerful effects

1649
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,540
of increasing epinephrine
on focusing concentration

1650
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,000
and running out and getting
stressed by a life event

1651
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,190
or getting into an argument
or something like that

1652
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:01,470
simply as a way to increase
focus and concentration

1653
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,060
doesn't seem that adaptive to me.

1654
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,290
So deliberate cold exposure

1655
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,820
is a straightforward way to do that,

1656
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,290
it doesn't involve anyone else,

1657
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:08,610
I suppose you could do
it with somebody else,

1658
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,260
but it doesn't require anyone else.

1659
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,750
And again, there are zero low

1660
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,970
and even negative cost
ways to approach that.

1661
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,260
If you'd like to know how long

1662
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,350
the positive effects of epinephrine last

1663
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,570
toward improving focus and concentration,

1664
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,520
well, if we look to that
study from DeGroote et al,

1665
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,692
the acute stress improves
cognitive performance study,

1666
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:28,770
they measured concentration before

1667
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,895
and 30 minutes after
the stress was induced

1668
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,770
and there does appear to
be a quite long lasting,

1669
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,260
really up to an hour or more effect

1670
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,420
of increasing epinephrine.

1671
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,180
So how might you apply
these sorts of protocols

1672
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,550
early in the day or later in the day?

1673
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,790
Well, one suggestion or one
potential protocol would be

1674
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,590
if you're going to sit
down and do some work,

1675
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:51,390
if you're already feeling
alert and focused,

1676
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,710
no need to reach to this tool,

1677
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,110
but if you're feeling like
your focus and alertness

1678
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,730
isn't quite where you'd like it to be,

1679
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,010
you could take a three
minute very cold shower

1680
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,050
or submerge yourself in cold
water for three minutes,

1681
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,760
you might have a cup of coffee as well

1682
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,050
and then sit down and do that work,

1683
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,660
maybe even throw in the
40 HZ binaural beats.

1684
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,780
All of that would be layering
in the different systems,

1685
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,340
the different neurochemicals,

1686
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:15,060
such as acetylcholine,
epinephrine and dopamine,

1687
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,080
that are going to lend themselves

1688
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,320
to a really terrific 90
minute or less work about.

1689
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,170
Now I'd like to discuss some
of the purely behavioral tools

1690
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,210
that quality peer reviewed science say

1691
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,870
can improve focus and
concentration significantly.

1692
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,730
At the beginning of today's episode,

1693
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:32,430
I talked about the study
from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab

1694
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,220
where they explored a 13 minute meditation

1695
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,160
done every day for a
period of eight weeks.

1696
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,650
That meditation led to
significant improvements

1697
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,840
in focus and concentration ability,

1698
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,480
as well as other aspects
of cognitive performance.

1699
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,540
It also improved mood and reduced stress.

1700
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,300
So you might be wondering what
exactly is this meditation?

1701
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,950
The meditation is very simple

1702
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,200
and it's one that anyone can perform.

1703
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,390
What you would want to do is set a timer

1704
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:58,860
for about 13 minutes,

1705
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,810
I don't think it has to
be exactly 13 minutes,

1706
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,986
but since that's what they
included in the study,

1707
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:05,730
you would set a timer for 13 minutes.

1708
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:09,120
You would sit or lie
down, close your eyes,

1709
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,240
and you would simply
focus on your breathing.

1710
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,500
Most people are going to benefit

1711
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,900
from only doing that
breathing through their nose,

1712
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,090
but if you have some sort of obstruction

1713
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,710
or inability to breathe
just through your nose,

1714
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,760
you could probably also do it

1715
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,430
by breathing through your nose
and mouth or just your mouth.

1716
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,890
But ideally you would
do just nasal breathing

1717
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,180
for a period of 13 minutes,

1718
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,860
concentrating on that breathing,

1719
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,220
and concentrating, meaning
bringing your awareness,

1720
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,410
your so-called interoceptive awareness

1721
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:37,050
if you wanted to get
really technical about it,

1722
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,760
your interoceptive awareness

1723
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,240
to a point just about an
inch inside of your forehead.

1724
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,073
Now, of course,

1725
01:02:43,073 --> 01:02:44,954
that might sound kind
of gory to some of you,

1726
01:02:44,954 --> 01:02:47,880
you've never actually
been inside your forehead,

1727
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,220
but just about an inch
behind your forehead

1728
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,350
is where you would want to
place your concentration

1729
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,810
while also concentrating
on your breathing.

1730
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,970
Now here's the thing about meditation

1731
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,820
that all studies of meditation show,

1732
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:04,080
which is that unless you are
a very experienced meditator,

1733
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,030
your concentration, your focus

1734
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,760
will drift away from your breathing

1735
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,200
and away from that location
about an inch inside your head,

1736
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,011
inside your brain, about
just behind your forehead.

1737
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:20,940
That will happen maybe every
10 seconds, every 20 seconds,

1738
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,650
maybe even every five seconds,

1739
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,680
but an important part of
such a meditation practice

1740
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,630
to improve concentration and focus

1741
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,775
is that you are continually refocusing

1742
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:32,700
back to that specific location

1743
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,115
and refocusing back on your breath.

1744
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:37,920
This is something that again,
is not often discussed.

1745
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,540
People think that if you do a meditation

1746
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,400
and you're supposed to
concentrate on your breath,

1747
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,450
that if your mind drifts

1748
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,340
that somehow you failed
in that meditation,

1749
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,170
but actually that's not the case.

1750
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:49,650
A huge component of improving your ability

1751
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,740
to focus and concentrate
by way of neuroplasticity,

1752
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,860
rewiring of the circuits
for focus and concentration,

1753
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,520
is the repeated return to a state of focus

1754
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,210
from a state of non-focus
or diminished focus.

1755
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,239
So think about it like trying
to drive down the freeway

1756
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:09,510
and staying between the
lane lines, excuse me.

1757
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,590
And every once in a while,

1758
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,050
because there's a bit
of drift on the vehicle,

1759
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,490
maybe the wheels aren't aligned correctly

1760
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,320
or there's something else
wrong with the chassis

1761
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,340
or the steering device,

1762
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,080
it starts to drift right a little bit,

1763
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,670
then you hit the rumble strip to go rrrr,

1764
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,380
and then you pull back to the center.

1765
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,890
That's really what a focused
meditation practice is about

1766
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,350
as opposed to expecting yourself

1767
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,350
to stay between the mental
lane lines, so to speak.

1768
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,450
So if you're somebody who's
going to do a practice

1769
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:34,770
of the sort that I described,

1770
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,350
13 minute meditation practice every day,

1771
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:39,360
you'd want to sit or lie
down, close your eyes,

1772
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,740
start to concentrate on your breath,

1773
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,300
focus your attention

1774
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,270
on a location about an
inch behind your forehead,

1775
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:48,120
and then fully expect that at some point,

1776
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,830
you'll be thinking about something else,

1777
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:52,830
and that's a cue to focus
back to that location

1778
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,270
just about an inch behind your forehead

1779
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,220
and back to your breath.

1780
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,780
By doing that repeatedly over and over,

1781
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,400
what you're really training up

1782
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,160
is the network within your brain

1783
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,560
that indeed includes
that prefrontal cortex

1784
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,600
that you're focusing on as
well as some other structures,

1785
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,240
the inferior temporal cortex,
indeed the hippocampus,

1786
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,890
a structure associated with memory,

1787
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,230
and other components of the neural circuit

1788
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,880
that are involved in directing

1789
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,100
our mental focus and concentration.

1790
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,440
Again, I can't emphasize the importance

1791
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,890
of this practice being one
of focusing and refocusing.

1792
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,170
In fact, I would prefer
to call such a practice,

1793
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:29,610
a refocus focused meditation,
or a constantly refocusing,

1794
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,950
or maybe you all can come up
with a better name for it,

1795
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,870
I'm certainly not that
good at naming things,

1796
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,030
but this sort of meditation practice

1797
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,863
has been shown

1798
01:05:36,863 --> 01:05:39,727
in the study by the Suzuki
lab and other studies

1799
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,720
to really improve people's ability

1800
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,300
to focus and remain focused,

1801
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:49,140
so much so that in the beautiful
book, "Altered States,"

1802
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,450
they describe a number of
different meditation practices,

1803
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:54,750
some a little bit longer than
the one that I described,

1804
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,030
one that's 17 minutes,
another one that's 30 minutes,

1805
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,010
some people will meditate
as long as 60 minutes a day,

1806
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:01,080
although that's quite a
long time, in my opinion.

1807
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,840
The point here isn't how long you focus

1808
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,870
or somehow trying to achieve total focus

1809
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,720
for the entire 13 minute or 17 minute

1810
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,390
or 60 minute about of meditation.

1811
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:13,740
While that would be wonderful

1812
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,810
and I think many people aspire to do that,

1813
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,310
that's a lot of hard mental work.

1814
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,710
I think for most people out
there, including myself,

1815
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,180
a relatively short meditation
practice of about 13 minutes

1816
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,401
in which you fully expect

1817
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:28,740
your focus and concentration to drift,

1818
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,630
but that you are continually refocusing

1819
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,520
is going to be the most effective,

1820
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,320
yes, indeed, the most effective

1821
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,740
at teaching yourself to
focus and stay concentrated.

1822
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,630
In fact, I invite you to interpret

1823
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,930
every time that you
focus off that location

1824
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:44,850
about one inch behind your forehead,

1825
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:46,350
as an opportunity to refocus

1826
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:49,290
and think about the
refocusing as the trigger

1827
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:51,000
for teaching your neural circuits

1828
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,610
how to focus for extended periods of time.

1829
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,773
And as a bonus to that sort
of meditation practice,

1830
01:06:55,773 --> 01:06:57,930
the study from Wendy Suzuki's lab

1831
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,140
also showed that people
experience improvements in sleep

1832
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,580
and improvements in memory,

1833
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,040
so not just improvements in
mood and reduction in stress

1834
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,440
and improvements in
focus and concentration,

1835
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,120
but all these other positive benefits

1836
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,240
from just doing that 13 minute
a day meditation practice.

1837
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,070
It's one that I've started to adopt

1838
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,477
and have felt tremendous benefit from

1839
01:07:15,477 --> 01:07:18,180
and that I encourage many
of you to try as well.

1840
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,260
The one cautionary note

1841
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,180
is the one that I mentioned at
the beginning of the episode,

1842
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:25,950
which is because the refocus
as I'll call it, meditation,

1843
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,500
does involve a significant
amount of effort

1844
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,080
and engagement of these
prefrontal cortical circuits,

1845
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,040
it is disruptive to sleep if
performed too closely to sleep.

1846
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,660
So if you are going to do that practice,

1847
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,400
I recommend that you not do it

1848
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,800
within the four hours
prior to your bedtime.

1849
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,633
Earlier I mentioned

1850
01:07:41,633 --> 01:07:43,682
that I would talk about
ways to improve focus

1851
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:45,450
if you are sleep deprived.

1852
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,760
This is something that
I'm all too familiar with.

1853
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,250
I put a lot of effort
into optimizing my sleep,

1854
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,840
that's something that
with each passing year,

1855
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,370
I put more and more effort into,

1856
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,930
again, because sleep is so vital

1857
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,310
for mental health, physical health

1858
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,080
and performance of all kinds,

1859
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,840
but certainly in my role as a student,

1860
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,930
in my role as a professor
and in my role in life,

1861
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:05,850
I've had numerous times

1862
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:07,920
in which I simply did not get enough sleep

1863
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,980
or my sleep was terrible
for whatever reason,

1864
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,530
and yet I still had work
demands and social demands,

1865
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,363
et cetera.

1866
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,069
One practice that is very effective

1867
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:18,779
at allowing you to focus

1868
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:20,969
better than you would otherwise

1869
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:23,010
under conditions of sleep deprivation

1870
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:26,279
is so called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.

1871
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:29,099
This is also referred to
sometimes as yoga nidra.

1872
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,109
Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.

1873
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:35,189
Yoga nidra is a practice of
lying down for about 10 to 30

1874
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:37,259
sometimes even as long as 60 minutes,

1875
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,720
you listen to a script,
it's an audio script,

1876
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,390
that takes you through a
progressive deep relaxation,

1877
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,770
it involves a body scan,

1878
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,240
some long exhale breathing.

1879
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,600
It is very restorative in the
sense that one tends to emerge

1880
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,620
from yoga nidra or NSDR
feeling greatly refreshed

1881
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:54,899
compared to how you felt prior to it.

1882
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:57,269
There is also terrific neuroimaging data

1883
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,850
from laboratories in Denmark

1884
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,279
showing that there's a
restoration of dopamine levels

1885
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:06,479
in the so-called basal ganglia
after NSDR AKA yoga nidra.

1886
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,209
Whether or not you call
it yoga nidra or NSDR,

1887
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,850
which is what I refer to
it as, non-sleep deep rest,

1888
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,390
you can find these scripts at
zero cost in multiple places.

1889
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,990
You can find there are
certain apps that are NSDR

1890
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,040
or yoga nidra apps.

1891
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,106
There is a NSDR protocol

1892
01:09:22,106 --> 01:09:25,560
that was put out there by
Madefor which is on YouTube

1893
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,149
that you can access for free.

1894
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:31,049
There is a NSDR or I should
say a number of NSDR protocols

1895
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,850
through the Virtusan app.

1896
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,710
There are, again, number
of different places

1897
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:37,710
that one can access NSDR protocols.

1898
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:42,240
I do NSDR for 10 to 30 minutes
per day every single day,

1899
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,520
not just on days where I'm sleep deprived.

1900
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,840
If I happen to be sleep deprived,

1901
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,290
I would extend that NSDR
to 30 or 60 minutes.

1902
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:50,760
And when you do that NSDR

1903
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,399
will depend on when you
have time for that NSDR.

1904
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:54,330
When I haven't slept well,

1905
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,340
what I'll try and do is find a quiet place

1906
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:59,927
where I can do NSDR for
30 or ideally 60 minutes.

1907
01:09:59,927 --> 01:10:02,580
Sometimes I will fall back
asleep during that NSDR,

1908
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,740
that's fine if you do that,

1909
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,484
but most people will stay
awake during the NSDR,

1910
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:10,260
and then I'll emerge from
that and go about my day.

1911
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,490
If in the afternoon,

1912
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:13,320
I'm very fatigued
because of lack of sleep,

1913
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,520
I might do another NSDR
of 10 to 30 or 60 minutes,

1914
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,840
and then another work about.

1915
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,420
Again, NSDR is something I do every day.

1916
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,240
I talked a lot about this in
the episodes related to sleep,

1917
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,560
because it can help you get better

1918
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,020
at falling and staying asleep at night

1919
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,990
in addition to feeling restorative

1920
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,700
in that immediate timeframe of the day

1921
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,960
in which you do NSDR,

1922
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,970
so it's immensely
beneficial at various times

1923
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,530
and for various purposes.

1924
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,060
But here within the context

1925
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,530
of trying to concentrate and focus

1926
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,300
when you're sleep deprived,

1927
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:46,920
NSDR, AKA yoga nidra is an
immensely beneficial practice.

1928
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,410
There's growing amounts of quality science

1929
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,770
pointing to the neurochemical
replenishing effects,

1930
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,450
as I mentioned before, dopamine,

1931
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,330
but also the potential for NSDR

1932
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:59,280
to replace sleep that you've lost.

1933
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,220
I would never want anyone
to try and use NSDR

1934
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,120
as a total replacement for sleep,

1935
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,910
but under conditions in which
you cannot control your sleep,

1936
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:08,640
NSDR is going to be the
best way that I am aware of

1937
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,670
to restore your ability
to focus and concentrate

1938
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:13,080
for whatever purpose.

1939
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,850
And if you emerge from your NSDR

1940
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,930
and then drink some caffeine,

1941
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,340
you'll notice an even greater capacity

1942
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,190
for focus and concentration

1943
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,710
for all the reasons directly
related to caffeine.

1944
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,710
So again, NSDR is a general tool

1945
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,827
for enhancing your ability to sleep

1946
01:11:27,827 --> 01:11:29,760
and it's a tool that you can use

1947
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,880
in order to compensate for,
at least to some degree,

1948
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,740
compensate for lost sleep

1949
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,660
when you need to focus and concentrate.

1950
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,840
One thing that really
contrasts NSDR and yoga nidra

1951
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,700
with the sort of focused meditation

1952
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,990
that I talked about a few minutes ago,

1953
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,760
the 13 minute meditation,

1954
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,650
is that during the 13 minute meditation,

1955
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,930
you're actively trying
to refocus and focus,

1956
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,670
whereas during NSDR and yoga nidra,

1957
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:52,770
you're actually trying to defocus.

1958
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,810
So you can think of the
13 minute meditation

1959
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,730
for refocusing and focusing

1960
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:00,450
as directly tapping into and mediating

1961
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,940
improvements in the circuitry
for focus and concentration

1962
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,970
whereas you can think
of NSDR and yoga nidra

1963
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,790
as modulating your brain and body state

1964
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:12,210
to allow you to focus
and concentrate better.

1965
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,040
Now another tool that you can use

1966
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,110
to directly tap in

1967
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:17,250
to the circuits for
focus and concentration

1968
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:22,020
and to greatly accelerate
neuroplasticity, the improvements,

1969
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,790
or I should say the
changes in those circuits

1970
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,160
that will allow you to
focus and concentrate better

1971
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,240
is hypnosis.

1972
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,640
A lot of people hear hypnosis
and they think stage hypnosis,

1973
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,020
you know, people squawking like chickens

1974
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,610
and doing things against their will,

1975
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:35,940
but actually hypnosis is a atypical

1976
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,470
but highly accessible brain state

1977
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:40,072
that's been studied with a lot of rigor

1978
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:42,630
at Stanford University School of Medicine

1979
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,340
by my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,

1980
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,530
he's been a guest on
this podcast previously.

1981
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,210
Hypnosis is a unique brain state

1982
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,060
because it's one in which
you are deeply focused

1983
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,620
and yet deeply relaxed.

1984
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,140
So to just sort of set up
the array of practices here

1985
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:56,880
so you can think about them logically,

1986
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,530
the focus refocus meditation

1987
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:02,580
is based on and focused
on focus, no pun intended.

1988
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,780
NSDR and yoga nidra are
aimed at deep relaxation.

1989
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,380
Hypnosis is this atypical,
very powerful brain state

1990
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,260
in which you combine high levels of focus

1991
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,310
and deep relaxation.

1992
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,890
Now it's a little bit of a tough one

1993
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,510
to just take oneself into,

1994
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:20,010
but fortunately, there's a tool

1995
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,200
based on a lot of quality
peer-reviewed research

1996
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,670
from the Spiegel lab and other labs

1997
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:26,640
and that is the Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i.

1998
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,240
The Reveri app is available for no cost,

1999
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,073
at least for a period of time

2000
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,450
and then I think they place
certain elements of it

2001
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:34,620
behind a pay wall,

2002
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,080
but you can try at zero cost,

2003
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,130
it's available for Apple,

2004
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:40,650
soon I think also to be
available for Android,

2005
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,320
and they have specific hypnosis protocols

2006
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,997
that you listen to, and these
are very brief protocols,

2007
01:13:45,997 --> 01:13:47,970
follow the instructions,

2008
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,740
you're listening to a
particular audio script

2009
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,450
of David Spiegel himself,

2010
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,010
and some progressive breathing

2011
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,600
and actually some eye movements

2012
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,820
that are directly linked
to the neural circuits

2013
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,760
that allow for these highly
focused, deeply relaxed states.

2014
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,160
And there are components
within the Reveri app

2015
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,090
specifically geared

2016
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:06,000
towards improving focus and concentration.

2017
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,200
So again,

2018
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,940
there's meditation for focus,

2019
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,970
there's deliberate
decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,

2020
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,530
which take you into deep relaxation,

2021
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:17,610
and then hypnosis is this very
special, very directed state

2022
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:20,880
of highly focused and highly relaxed,

2023
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,470
or I should say deeply relaxed,

2024
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:24,660
that allow access to the neural circuits

2025
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,370
for focus and concentration

2026
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:29,160
and allow you to tune those
up and to improve those

2027
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,040
very significantly in a
very brief amount of time.

2028
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,900
And again, some of those hypnosis scripts

2029
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,100
are as short as eight minutes,

2030
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,870
some are as long as 13 minutes.

2031
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:40,140
So what we're really talking
about here are zero cost tools

2032
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,540
that directly tap into
the neural circuits,

2033
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,130
the components within your brain,

2034
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:47,520
that allow for deep relaxation,
allow for deep focus,

2035
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,030
and improve your ability to
focus and concentrate over time

2036
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:53,010
simply by repeating these.

2037
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:56,700
How often do you need to
repeat the Reveri hypnosis

2038
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,950
for focus and concentration
before you see benefits?

2039
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:00,919
Well, that will vary
from person to person.

2040
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:03,990
I tend to use it once
every third or fourth day

2041
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,264
and have experienced
tremendous benefits from it.

2042
01:15:06,264 --> 01:15:08,070
I don't think I'm unique in that sense,

2043
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,860
they have a lot of data
to support this Reveri app

2044
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,898
and the protocols within it.

2045
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:15,210
How long do you have to do NSDR

2046
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,680
before you experience those benefits?

2047
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,330
There, I would say the
first time and every time,

2048
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,860
because it's so deeply relaxing

2049
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,990
that you emerge from it
feeling quite restored

2050
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:23,653
relative to how you went into it.

2051
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:27,000
And as I mentioned earlier
in the study on meditation,

2052
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,900
it took about eight weeks

2053
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,480
to see the effects that
they observed in that study,

2054
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,460
but they didn't observe
shorter time points.

2055
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,030
So I highly encourage
people to explore meditation

2056
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,440
geared towards focus and refocus,

2057
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,590
also NSDR, nonsleep deep
rest, AKA yoga nidra,

2058
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:41,610
and the Reveri app,

2059
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:44,242
Specifically the hypnosis
within the Reveri app,

2060
01:15:44,242 --> 01:15:47,340
that's geared towards improving
focus and concentration.

2061
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,740
All of these have terrific
science to support them,

2062
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,110
this is not woo science or hacks

2063
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,880
or just something that
people came up with.

2064
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,470
This is all grounded in work

2065
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:58,170
from some of the best
universities in the world,

2066
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,580
from excellent groups

2067
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,440
who've looked at underlying
neural mechanisms

2068
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,150
and measured things with a lot of rigor,

2069
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,140
et cetera, et cetera.

2070
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,400
These tools are available to you,

2071
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,530
I highly recommend that you use them.

2072
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:08,370
And if you're interested

2073
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:10,470
in the optimal time of day to do these,

2074
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:14,400
we already mentioned that
the focus refocus meditation

2075
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,440
shouldn't be done too close to sleep,

2076
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,580
the Reveri hypnosis app can
be done at any time really,

2077
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,960
in fact, there's a component

2078
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,670
of falling back of sleep in there,

2079
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:25,410
in other words, a hypnosis
specifically geared

2080
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,960
toward helping people teach
themselves to fall back asleep

2081
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,430
when they wake up in
the middle of the night.

2082
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,600
NSDR, I always say,

2083
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,640
can be done first thing in
the morning, in the afternoon

2084
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:33,540
or any time of day,

2085
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,373
and in fact,

2086
01:16:34,373 --> 01:16:35,520
I'll sometimes do that in
the middle of the night

2087
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,100
if I happen to wake up and
need to get back to sleep.

2088
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,340
So really these tools can be
applied most any time of day,

2089
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,810
except for that one caveat

2090
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,580
about the focus refocus meditation

2091
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,530
not being done too close to sleep.

2092
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,480
Now there's another
set of behavioral tools

2093
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,420
that can really help enhance
one's ability to focus

2094
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,614
and those are visual based tools.

2095
01:16:53,614 --> 01:16:55,830
In fact, the tools I'm about to describe

2096
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,770
are actually being employed
in a number of schools

2097
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:01,680
in China and elsewhere in
order to teach children

2098
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,743
to focus better and for
longer periods of time.

2099
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:10,590
The key principle here is that
much of our cognitive focus,

2100
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:13,110
our ability to think about
something in a very specific way

2101
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,550
and stay focused on it,

2102
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:18,090
to read or to follow
a line of conversation

2103
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:20,250
or math or music, et cetera,

2104
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:24,030
is going to be directed
by our visual system.

2105
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,520
Our visual system has two
forms of attention and focus.

2106
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,430
One is overt focus, which
is very straightforward.

2107
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:30,780
If I'm looking at the tip of my pen,

2108
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,800
for those of who are listening right now,

2109
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,840
I'm looking at the tip of
my pen, that's overt focus,

2110
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,610
I'm focusing on it with my eyes,

2111
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:38,220
and of course, the rest of
my brain then will follow

2112
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,377
and start to analyze the
details of what I'm seeing

2113
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:42,630
and the contours of the pen, et cetera.

2114
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,670
It seems sort of obvious
when you first hear it,

2115
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,220
but our cognitive focus tends to follow

2116
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:49,530
our overt visual focus.

2117
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:51,780
That's also why they
put blinders on horses.

2118
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,960
That's also why sometimes
wearing a hoodie or a hat

2119
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,301
or limiting your visual field in some way

2120
01:17:57,301 --> 01:18:00,140
can help you enhance your cognitive focus,

2121
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,650
it can help limit distraction.

2122
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,870
You're just not seeing as much.

2123
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:05,700
It's also why when we ingest caffeine

2124
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,590
or any kind of stimulant
or we are stressed

2125
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,910
and our pupils dilate

2126
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:10,560
and our vision becomes more tunnel-like,

2127
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,420
less panoramic, but more tunnel-like,

2128
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,220
you know they say a soda
straw view of the world

2129
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,794
or you're looking through a tunnel,

2130
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:18,150
your focus, your visual focus

2131
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,920
is actually driving your cognitive focus.

2132
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,100
Your cognitive focus is
narrower than it would be

2133
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,960
if you were seeing the
whole scene that you're in.

2134
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,400
So when you hear this, it sounds obvious,

2135
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,620
but for many people,
including many scientists,

2136
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,420
it's just not obvious that
this would be the case.

2137
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,890
However, that is the case,

2138
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,800
your visual focus drives
your cognitive focus.

2139
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,480
So what is a practice

2140
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,570
that has been studied
in various laboratories

2141
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:41,190
and that's being employed
in various schools?

2142
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:46,190
Is to have children or adults
visually focus on one location

2143
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,570
for a given period of time.

2144
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,560
How long?

2145
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,290
Anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes,

2146
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,123
and believe it or not,

2147
01:18:53,123 --> 01:18:53,956
three minutes is a long time

2148
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:56,666
to maintain visual focus at one location.

2149
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:58,140
If you were to try that right now,

2150
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,150
you'd probably find it
to be a bit of a strain,

2151
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,800
but if you want to try it, you can.

2152
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,100
Keep in mind, you yes,
are allowed to blink,

2153
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,700
but also keep in mind that
meditation refocusing practice

2154
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,290
that we talked about earlier,

2155
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:13,560
that the refocusing is the key component

2156
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,841
of teaching yourself or your brain,

2157
01:19:15,841 --> 01:19:17,430
you are your brain, your brain is you,

2158
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:19,860
but to teach yourself how to focus better.

2159
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:23,190
So if you're going to
incorporate this practice,

2160
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,350
what you would want to
do is pick a location,

2161
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,460
it could be on a wall,

2162
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,230
it could be on your
computer in front of you,

2163
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,130
although I would encourage it

2164
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:31,020
to not be the contents
of your computer screen,

2165
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,670
you might just want to blank your screen,

2166
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:33,870
you might want to put a piece of paper

2167
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,660
with a crosshatch there,
any sort of visual target,

2168
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,100
or you can imagine a visual target

2169
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,500
and then focus your visual
attention on that target

2170
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,020
and try to breathe normally,
try and stay relaxed,

2171
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,430
and certainly allow yourself to blink

2172
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,870
so that your eyes don't try out.

2173
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:49,230
This is not a test of how long
you can go without blinking.

2174
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:51,900
By focusing on that particular location

2175
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,450
and by forcing yourself to
refocus on that location

2176
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:58,770
anytime your gaze, your vision
drifts from that location,

2177
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:02,130
you are encouraging the circuits for focus

2178
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,350
to get better at focusing
for longer and longer

2179
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,210
and at refocusing when your focus

2180
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:08,040
drifts off of that location.

2181
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,600
This is incorporating neural circuits,

2182
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,040
including the prefrontal cortex,

2183
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,570
things like the frontal eye fields.

2184
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:14,748
For those of you curious
about the underlying biology,

2185
01:20:14,748 --> 01:20:18,000
this practice is
recruiting certain elements

2186
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,500
of your so-called prefrontal cortex,

2187
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,480
also the frontal eye fields,

2188
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,150
which are locations not far
from the prefrontal cortex,

2189
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,640
that are involved in
deliberately directing your gaze

2190
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,190
to particular locations in space,

2191
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,090
not outer space,

2192
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,820
although you could do this by
focusing on stars I suppose,

2193
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,100
but in visual space.

2194
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,480
Now I mentioned before

2195
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,870
that this is overt visual
focus and attention,

2196
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,030
you are overtly looking at that location,

2197
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,400
but one also very powerful practice

2198
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,060
for improving focus and concentration

2199
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,610
is to use covert focus.

2200
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:53,190
Covert focus is where my gaze,

2201
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:56,310
my eyes are focused on one
location, such as my pen,

2202
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:58,770
but my focus is actually directed

2203
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,500
elsewhere in the room
or location that I'm in.

2204
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,580
My mind and to some extent
my peripheral vision

2205
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:08,130
is focused in this case on
the door just to my left

2206
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,360
in the room that I'm in.

2207
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,740
That takes a little bit more effort.

2208
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,750
This is something that
all old world primates,

2209
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,630
of which we are old world
primates, are able to do.

2210
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,030
And it probably evolved
as part of the mechanism

2211
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:21,870
by which animals could
evaluate their scene,

2212
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:25,800
evaluate predators,
evaluate other primates

2213
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,620
while not necessarily
staring at them directly

2214
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,330
so they can obtain information,

2215
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:32,880
we can obtain information
without having to direct our gaze

2216
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,230
specifically to one location.

2217
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:37,140
Maybe we can obtain information
from multiple locations,

2218
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,790
indeed, we can.

2219
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:41,460
Without getting too far
down the rabbit hole

2220
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,640
of how vision and cognition relate,

2221
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,897
because we've done episodes
on that previously,

2222
01:21:46,897 --> 01:21:51,720
and simply focusing on the
tools that can be incorporated

2223
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,140
to improve focus and concentration,
here's what I recommend.

2224
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:00,060
Set yourself a low bar
at first and set a timer

2225
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,570
and try to focus on one
location for 30 seconds

2226
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,130
and that's it for that day.

2227
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,170
The next day, you might add five seconds,

2228
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,300
and then the next day,
five seconds after that.

2229
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,190
If you miss a day, no big deal,

2230
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:14,520
simply do the practice for
the same amount of time

2231
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,680
that you did the last time
that you did the practice,

2232
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,800
and then gradually try and
increase the amount of time

2233
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,100
that you can focus on one
visual location overtly

2234
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,261
by looking directly at that location.

2235
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:28,020
If you like, and if you
feel you have the ability,

2236
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,870
you can try and do this through
covert attention and focus

2237
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:32,760
by looking straight forward for instance,

2238
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,560
and attending to something
in the corner of the room

2239
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,780
and trying to do that for 30 seconds,

2240
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,460
you'll find that that's
quite a bit harder,

2241
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,560
and then extending that by five seconds

2242
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,360
every time you do the practice.

2243
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,280
This is something that I
don't think you necessarily

2244
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,350
have to build up to being
able to do for a full hour

2245
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,760
in order to extract the benefits.

2246
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,520
In fact, the best way to
think about this practice

2247
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,400
is as a means to get into a focused state.

2248
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,640
If you remember back
about an hour or so ago,

2249
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,040
I was talking about how focused states

2250
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,510
are not a drop all the way in
and then exit type phenomenon.

2251
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,190
We don't just drop into a focused state

2252
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:07,170
the same way we don't drop
into the peak performance

2253
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:08,850
of a workout, we warm up.

2254
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:12,450
So what I recommend is having a 30 second

2255
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:17,450
to three minute period at the
beginning of a about to focus

2256
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,590
where you're going to
do work or physical work

2257
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:23,490
and anchoring your vision to one location

2258
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,810
somewhere in the room

2259
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,850
or if you want to do it
covertly, you can do that,

2260
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:28,500
setting a timer and trying to do that

2261
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,720
for anywhere from 30
seconds to three minutes.

2262
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:34,980
What you're doing when
you exercise that practice

2263
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:38,160
is you are ramping up neural activity

2264
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,690
within the neural circuits

2265
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,910
that create focus and concentration.

2266
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:44,520
Then, I would stop
looking at that location

2267
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,720
or that covert location

2268
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,520
and then I would move to the
work that you're trying to do,

2269
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,710
either mental work or physical work.

2270
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:52,470
And if about halfway
through your 90 minute about

2271
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:55,200
or at some point in your 90
minute about of work or exercise,

2272
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,090
you feel that your
concentration is drifting

2273
01:23:57,090 --> 01:23:58,380
rather than look at your phone

2274
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,080
and scroll through the
thousands of contexts

2275
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,390
that exists within social
media or your phone,

2276
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:05,790
try just picking a
location again on the wall,

2277
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,680
focusing back on that location,

2278
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,780
using that as a ramp up

2279
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,910
to then direct your focus back towards,

2280
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,743
if your weight training,

2281
01:24:12,743 --> 01:24:14,130
sets and reps that you
might be performing,

2282
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,000
if you're running,

2283
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
you might do this, or
cycling you might do this

2284
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,710
by focusing on a particular location

2285
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:22,543
and really homing in on
that location physically.

2286
01:24:22,543 --> 01:24:25,380
And this is a practice that a
lot of athletes use in fact,

2287
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:28,500
and if you're say doing
musical practice or math,

2288
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,210
well then, you'd want
to focus on something

2289
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,520
other than the task that
you're trying to perform.

2290
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,500
But again, using visual focus

2291
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,160
as a way to ramp up and
increase your overall ability

2292
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,540
to focus and concentrate,

2293
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,460
and then applying that to whatever it is

2294
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,500
that you're trying to learn or perform.

2295
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,090
Next, I'd like to talk about compounds

2296
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:47,192
that can improve concentration and focus,

2297
01:24:47,192 --> 01:24:50,130
and these are most often
consumed as supplements,

2298
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:51,720
although some of them, I should mention,

2299
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,030
can also be derived from food.

2300
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,363
Again, I just want to remind you

2301
01:24:55,363 --> 01:24:57,990
that there are things,
in this case compounds,

2302
01:24:57,990 --> 01:25:00,660
that can modulate a biological mechanism,

2303
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,420
that is can modulate
focus and concentration,

2304
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:06,750
and there are compounds that can mediate,

2305
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,723
can directly contribute to
concentration and focus.

2306
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:12,600
One of the key compounds

2307
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,880
that supports concentration and focus

2308
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,390
because it generally supports
mood, concentration and focus

2309
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:20,820
and brain function in general

2310
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,340
are the omega-3 essential fatty acids.

2311
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,920
I've talked about the
omega-3 essential fatty acids

2312
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,840
in a variety of contexts,
in particular depression,

2313
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,287
but also ADHD, there are
interesting data on that,

2314
01:25:31,287 --> 01:25:32,441
and it's really clear

2315
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:36,564
that getting somewhere between
one and three grams of EPA,

2316
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:37,824
that is one to three grams

2317
01:25:37,824 --> 01:25:42,824
of EPA essential fatty acid
per day can improve outcomes,

2318
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,740
that is can improve mood and
can improve cognitive function.

2319
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:47,579
And while there's some debate

2320
01:25:47,579 --> 01:25:50,670
about whether or not it can
improve cardiac function,

2321
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,740
it's very clear, at least to me,

2322
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,870
that ingesting one to three grams

2323
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:57,990
of EPA essential fatty
acid per day is beneficial.

2324
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,930
But again, in the context
of focus and concentration,

2325
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:04,830
it's in modulating the neural
circuits and brain function

2326
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:07,140
that are going to support
focus and concentration.

2327
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,750
It's not as if taking one to three grams

2328
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:12,090
of EPA essential fatty acid per day

2329
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:14,580
is going to tap directly into

2330
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:17,013
only the circuits for
focus and concentration.

2331
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,730
That said, and as discussed on the episode

2332
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:23,580
of the Huberman Lab Podcast
with Dr. Rhonda Patrick,

2333
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:26,824
and on the episode on ADHD that I did,

2334
01:26:26,824 --> 01:26:28,590
and on the episode on
depression that I did,

2335
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,350
I make it a point to
ingest one to three grams

2336
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,570
of EPAs per day.

2337
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,760
You can get those EPAs

2338
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,000
from other sources besides
supplements, of course,

2339
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,220
but supplements are going to
be the easiest way to do that.

2340
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,630
You could do that through liquid form,

2341
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,220
fish oil, cod liver oil,

2342
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,220
some people who are vegan opt
for other sources of EPAs,

2343
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,810
you can find those out there certainly.

2344
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,670
Some people even use prescription EPAs

2345
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:53,100
to get the dosage really high.

2346
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,710
Dr. Ronda Patrick talked about
this in the episode with me,

2347
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,150
that's actually something that she does.

2348
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,440
I don't take the prescription form,

2349
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,390
I get them through pill form

2350
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:03,600
through our supplement
affiliate, which is Momentous,

2351
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,940
but there are a number of
different quality sources

2352
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,424
of EPAs out there.

2353
01:27:07,424 --> 01:27:09,900
And some of those quality
sources also include things

2354
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,630
like fatty fish, algae,
and things of that sort.

2355
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:14,880
So I'll leave it to you as to
whether or not you supplement

2356
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,290
with omega-3 fatty acids

2357
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:17,940
in order to get that one
to three grams per day

2358
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,440
or whether or not you do it through food,

2359
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,172
but I would encourage you to
try and reach that threshold

2360
01:27:22,172 --> 01:27:25,410
because there are a number
of known positive effects

2361
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:27,660
for mood and brain function generally.

2362
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:31,020
The other thing that can
positively modulate brain function

2363
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:35,100
and that actually works as a
fuel for neurons to function

2364
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,720
and can improve cognitive performance,

2365
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,880
and particularly within
the brain circuits,

2366
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,170
such as the prefrontal cortex,

2367
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:43,290
that are involved in concentration
and focus is creatine.

2368
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,870
I know many people are familiar
with creatine monohydrate

2369
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,420
for its effects on muscle growth

2370
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,100
and strength and performance,

2371
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,590
but it's quite clear that the
bulk of scientific studies

2372
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:55,680
have examined the role of
creatine in the clinical context

2373
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,500
and as its role in improving
cognitive performance.

2374
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,660
So my read of the literature
has led to a practice

2375
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:03,030
in which I ingest five grams per day

2376
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,650
of creatine monohydrate,

2377
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:07,470
the sort of standard
form that's available in,

2378
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:09,390
this is generally available as a powder,

2379
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:10,223
that's certainly how I take it.

2380
01:28:10,223 --> 01:28:11,940
I'll take the creatine powder,

2381
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,310
I'll mix it with water or
with my Athletic Greens

2382
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:16,080
or some sort of electrolyte drink,

2383
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,930
whatever liquid happens to be
convenient to ingest that in,

2384
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:20,820
the time of day doesn't
really seem to be important.

2385
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:21,990
Some people are strong believers

2386
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:25,140
in consuming creatine post-workout.

2387
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,460
While that might be beneficial,

2388
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:29,730
I simply take it in the
morning or post-workout,

2389
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:32,310
it sort of depends on when
I remember to take it,

2390
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:34,740
but that five grams of creatine per day,

2391
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:37,260
in my case, really isn't
geared towards muscle growth

2392
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,760
or strength or performance

2393
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,350
as much as it's geared toward

2394
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:43,620
tapping into the creatine
phosphate system within the brain

2395
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,920
and specifically the benefits of creatine

2396
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,740
for prefrontal cortical
networks, again, modulating,

2397
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,760
not directly mediating,

2398
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,280
but modulating and generally supporting

2399
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,830
the brain networks that
are going to allow me

2400
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,230
to generate focus and concentration.

2401
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:01,950
So much like sleep, much
like omega-3 fatty acids,

2402
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,020
creatine monohydrate five grams a day

2403
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,180
seems to generally support brain function,

2404
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,750
which will generally support
concentration and focus.

2405
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,310
Now in terms of compounds

2406
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:14,640
that more specifically mediate
concentration and focus,

2407
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,740
we have to go back to
that arrow metaphor model

2408
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,750
that we talked about at the
beginning of the episode,

2409
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:22,950
that included epinephrine,
adrenaline, acetylcholine,

2410
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:24,990
which acts as this attentional spotlight,

2411
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:28,290
in fact, acetylcholine and
elevated levels of acetylcholine

2412
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,030
have been shown over and over again

2413
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:33,120
through beautiful work from
Mike Merzenich's lab at UCSF

2414
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,090
and the Kilgard Lab down in Houston,

2415
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:37,320
and a number of other labs,

2416
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,050
including Norm Weinberger's
lab at UC Irvine,

2417
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:41,310
again and again,

2418
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:46,255
to improve or even directly
gate neuroplasticity

2419
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:49,410
by increasing focus directly.

2420
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,430
That's a lot of word soup,

2421
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:51,750
but basically what happens is

2422
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,430
if acetylcholine transmission

2423
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,070
is increased even
transiently within the brain,

2424
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:57,630
there's a greater opportunity

2425
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,550
for neuroplasticity to take place.

2426
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,890
And the reason there's
a greater opportunity

2427
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:05,160
for neuroplasticity, AKA
learning to take place,

2428
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:08,070
is by way of the increased focus

2429
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,010
that spiking acetylcholine can provide.

2430
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,843
As I mentioned earlier,

2431
01:30:11,843 --> 01:30:14,040
there are a number of different
foods which contain choline,

2432
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,310
you can look those up online,

2433
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:18,840
choline acting as an amino acid
precursor to acetylcholine,

2434
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,610
but of course, there are
compounds, there are supplements

2435
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:23,400
that can further and more
acutely increase acetylcholine,

2436
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,080
and indeed, I use these myself.

2437
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,650
The most effective one
I've found is Alpha-GPC.

2438
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,710
Alpha-GPC consumed at dosages

2439
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,590
of 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams

2440
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:37,410
prior to a work about
or prior to a workout

2441
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:40,620
greatly increase one's ability
to focus and concentrate,

2442
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,000
at least that's been my experience,

2443
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,280
and there are some good data in humans.

2444
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,230
So how would I use Alpha-GPC?

2445
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:49,980
I would use Alpha-GPC by taking
it about 10 to 20 minutes

2446
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,590
prior to any time I want to focus

2447
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:54,720
or concentrate very deeply.

2448
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:57,870
I've taken as much as 600
milligrams at one time,

2449
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,090
although I find that 300
milligrams is enough for me,

2450
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:02,700
and I tend to be quite
sensitive to supplements

2451
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,050
and caffeine in general,

2452
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:07,470
so I'll sometimes take
it alongside yerba mate

2453
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:10,800
or with yerba mate or with
coffee prior to a workout

2454
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,810
or prior to a about of work

2455
01:31:12,810 --> 01:31:15,270
in which I'm focusing on mental work.

2456
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,620
So it could be reading, writing,

2457
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,330
could be math, could be data analysis,

2458
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,163
could be anything

2459
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:21,000
where I need a lot of
focus and concentration.

2460
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,620
Now a number of people have contacted me

2461
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:26,880
about a recent study
suggesting that Alpha-GPC

2462
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,680
when taken chronically over many years

2463
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,160
could increase one's
vulnerability to stroke.

2464
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,408
I've looked at those data
and my read of the data

2465
01:31:35,408 --> 01:31:37,620
is that they're not very conclusive,

2466
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:40,693
although anytime you
see something like that,

2467
01:31:40,693 --> 01:31:42,393
a study that's pointing to the fact

2468
01:31:42,393 --> 01:31:43,590
that a given compound

2469
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,780
might increase the propensity for stroke,

2470
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,370
you obviously want to be concerned.

2471
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:50,670
So we have to ask ourselves
how, by what mechanism that is,

2472
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:54,750
could Alpha-GPC be increasing
the susceptibility to stroke?

2473
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:57,960
And it seems to be related
to increases in TMAO,

2474
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:01,209
which is a marker related to
the cardiovascular system.

2475
01:32:01,209 --> 01:32:06,180
And one known way to
offset increases in TMAO

2476
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:08,490
that are associated either with Alpha-GPC

2477
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:11,550
or increases due to other things,

2478
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:13,890
so ingestion of particular food compounds

2479
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,690
actually can increase TMAO,

2480
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:20,160
is to offset that by taking
600 milligrams of garlic.

2481
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,894
Now I've been taking Alpha-GPC

2482
01:32:21,894 --> 01:32:23,940
pretty consistently for a number of years.

2483
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,260
I do not take it every day.

2484
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,360
I would say I take it
about four days per week,

2485
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,420
again, prior to workouts
or bouts of cognitive work.

2486
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,030
I have not seen my TMAO spike

2487
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:36,420
and I've evaluated that
by way of blood tests,

2488
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,390
but nonetheless, I take
600 milligrams of garlic

2489
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:42,480
in capsule form anytime I eat anyway

2490
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,640
and I do that for general
cardiovascular function

2491
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,660
and there's some interesting data

2492
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,660
on immune system function,
et cetera for garlic.

2493
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:52,620
So I've been consuming 600
milligram capsules of garlic

2494
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,730
for some period of time.

2495
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:56,580
Some days, I'll ingest just
one 600 milligram capsule,

2496
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,900
other times, I'll take two,

2497
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,943
but based on this recent study
and the concerns about TMAO,

2498
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:03,570
I make it a point

2499
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:07,500
to always ingest a 600
milligram capsule of garlic

2500
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,090
anytime I take Alpha-GPC,

2501
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:11,670
which again for me is
about four days per week.

2502
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,051
So in our model of attention and focus,

2503
01:33:14,051 --> 01:33:16,950
you can now clearly see
why taking Alpha-GPC,

2504
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:19,170
which increases acetylcholine transmission

2505
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:21,570
would be beneficial for
concentration and focus

2506
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:24,360
and why taking it with a double espresso

2507
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,700
or why taking it with yerba mate

2508
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:29,790
would further increase
concentration and focus

2509
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:31,156
because as I mentioned earlier,

2510
01:33:31,156 --> 01:33:33,918
caffeine is going to increase epinephrine.

2511
01:33:33,918 --> 01:33:36,330
It's also going to increase the density

2512
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:37,980
of dopamine receptors

2513
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:40,140
and the Alpha-GPC is going
to increase acetylcholine,

2514
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,640
this spotlighting for cognition,

2515
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,550
this ability to really
amplify the activity

2516
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:45,930
of specific neural networks,

2517
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:47,610
which is largely what's happening

2518
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:49,260
when you're trying to focus

2519
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,660
and pay attention to
something specifically.

2520
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,160
So if one wants to increase

2521
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,460
the amount of dopamine
transmission in the brain and body

2522
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,400
for sake of increasing
concentration and focus,

2523
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,410
one of the most efficient ways to do that

2524
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:03,720
is by ingestion of the
amino acid L-tyrosine.

2525
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,810
Again, L-tyrosine can be
derived from food sources,

2526
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:07,710
I invite you to look up

2527
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,090
those various food sources on the web,

2528
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:10,770
simply go to a web browser and put in

2529
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,420
foods that contain a lot of L-tyrosine

2530
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:14,996
and you'll get a rich array
of choices to select from.

2531
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:19,470
But in my case, I use
L-tyrosine in capsule form.

2532
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,734
I will take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,

2533
01:34:21,734 --> 01:34:25,170
300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
and a cup of coffee.

2534
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:27,210
I'm careful to do this early in the day,

2535
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,920
certainly not after two or 3:00 PM

2536
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,020
because I don't want
to diminish my ability

2537
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,626
to fall and stay asleep that night.

2538
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:34,740
I'll do this early in
the day before a workout

2539
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:38,444
or before a about of
concentrated mental work.

2540
01:34:38,444 --> 01:34:41,730
Again, I tend to do this
about four days per week,

2541
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:45,311
so certainly not every
time I sit down to do work.

2542
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:47,730
And I should also mention

2543
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:49,650
that I still tend to do
the behavioral tools.

2544
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,780
I'll tend to use five
minutes of binaural beats

2545
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,682
or binaural beats
throughout the work session,

2546
01:34:53,682 --> 01:34:56,498
sometimes do a ice bath
or a cold shower before.

2547
01:34:56,498 --> 01:34:58,320
I don't want to give the impression

2548
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,740
that I combine every tool
that I've talked about today

2549
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,940
for a given workout.

2550
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:05,850
I mean, that would be pretty
wild to take a cold shower,

2551
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:08,190
pop an L-tyrosine, take an Alpha-GPC,

2552
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:10,350
drink two espresso,
listen to binaural beats.

2553
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:13,440
That to me seems like
a very inefficient way

2554
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,334
to go about life.

2555
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:18,930
In fact, I make it a
point to try and use tools

2556
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:21,420
to increase my ability
to concentrate and focus,

2557
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:24,060
but not to combine more
than two or three of them

2558
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:24,893
at any one time.

2559
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:25,800
And when I say two or three,

2560
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,667
what I mean is I will use
supplements like Alpha-GPC,

2561
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:31,800
L-Tyrosine and caffeine together
before certain work bouts,

2562
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,720
I might use the visual practice

2563
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,490
of focusing on a given
location for a minute

2564
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:37,002
before I begin that work about,

2565
01:35:37,002 --> 01:35:38,940
I might combine those.

2566
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:41,730
Then another time I
might take a cold shower

2567
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:43,110
prior to doing some work.

2568
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,810
Other days, I confess,
I've slept very well

2569
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:49,530
or my enthusiasm about what
I'm about to work on is such

2570
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,480
that I don't require any of these tools.

2571
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,820
Again, there's no requirement,

2572
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,800
there's no pressure to
use any of these tools,

2573
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,375
behavioral, supplement based or otherwise.

2574
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:02,010
It's simply a matter of using the tools

2575
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:02,970
that are going to allow you

2576
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:04,470
to achieve the states you want to achieve

2577
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:07,860
and to improve your ability
to go into those states

2578
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:09,210
without any help at all.

2579
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:10,620
And this is what I find

2580
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,540
particularly attractive about supplements.

2581
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,070
It's not so much that they put you

2582
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:16,290
into the ideal state for that work

2583
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:18,150
and then you accomplish that work

2584
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:20,044
and then you always rely
on those supplements.

2585
01:36:20,044 --> 01:36:22,260
I prefer to look at supplements

2586
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,910
of the sort that I just described

2587
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:27,561
as a route into a deeper trench
of focus and concentration

2588
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:30,780
that I use as a tool to teach myself

2589
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,400
to focus and concentrate more deeply,

2590
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,470
such that I don't need those tools

2591
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:37,403
every single time I try
and focus and concentrate.

2592
01:36:37,403 --> 01:36:39,390
I think this is an important point

2593
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:41,850
because I think that many
people think of supplements

2594
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:46,850
as a crutch or a way of
simply getting into a state

2595
01:36:46,877 --> 01:36:50,850
for which no other tool
will suffice or replace.

2596
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,560
But in that context,

2597
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,200
I want to remind you of the
larger context of pharmacology,

2598
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,000
which is the vast landscape

2599
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,580
of prescription pharmacology for ADHD,

2600
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,860
for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

2601
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:05,370
Now I covered that
landscape in intense detail

2602
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:07,754
on the episode on ADHD and focus.

2603
01:37:07,754 --> 01:37:11,450
And just to summarize, there is of course,

2604
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:16,050
Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,
Modafinil, Armodafinil,

2605
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:17,031
a number of different compounds,

2606
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:21,120
all of which generally
increase dopamine transmission

2607
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,710
in the brain, so increasing dopamine,

2608
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:25,260
and all of which generally
increase epinephrine,

2609
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:27,544
adrenaline transmission
in the brain and body.

2610
01:37:27,544 --> 01:37:30,360
And many of those compounds

2611
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,520
have been of tremendous benefit

2612
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,490
to children and even some
adults who suffer from ADHD.

2613
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:38,910
So properly prescribed at
the appropriate dosage,

2614
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:41,910
those compounds can really help people

2615
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:44,309
with clinically diagnosed ADHD.

2616
01:37:44,309 --> 01:37:48,270
The way they help those people
is a bit surprising, however.

2617
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,820
You might think, well they
turn on the brain chemicals

2618
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,080
that allow those people
to concentrate and focus.

2619
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,245
That's true,

2620
01:37:54,245 --> 01:37:56,610
but they also have the benefit

2621
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:00,510
of teaching those brain
circuits how to engage.

2622
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:04,170
And that's one of the reasons
why somewhat paradoxically

2623
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:07,470
giving a stimulant like
Ritalin or Adderall

2624
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:09,960
to a kid that legitimately needs it,

2625
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,690
obviously, you don't want to
do this without the oversight

2626
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:15,810
and careful evaluation of a psychiatrist,

2627
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:19,094
but giving that to a
kid who has severe ADHD,

2628
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:22,230
you would think would make
them more rambunctious,

2629
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,810
less able to focus and
more distractible overall.

2630
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:28,137
After all, Ritalin,
Modafinil, Armodafinil,

2631
01:38:28,137 --> 01:38:29,490
all these things are stimulants.

2632
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:30,420
So you take a kid

2633
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,300
who has attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder

2634
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,190
and give them these drugs

2635
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:37,470
that increase transmission
of dopamine and epinephrine

2636
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:38,760
and you think, wow,
it's going to make them

2637
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,560
even more distractible and hyperactive

2638
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,210
and indeed, it has the opposite effect.

2639
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:44,055
It doesn't necessarily
make them feel calm,

2640
01:38:44,055 --> 01:38:47,460
but it makes them feel
that they can focus,

2641
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,470
they really can anchor their attention.

2642
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,231
And the idea is that it's
teaching those neural circuits

2643
01:38:52,231 --> 01:38:55,320
or those neural circuits
rather are teaching themselves

2644
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,720
to engage and to focus and concentrate.

2645
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,580
And the ideal situation is one in which

2646
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:02,460
the total dosage of those
compounds, those drugs,

2647
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:03,720
can be reduced over time

2648
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,880
as those circuits learn to come online

2649
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,230
through purely behavioral tools.

2650
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:09,690
Now oftentimes, there's a
maintenance of those drugs

2651
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:10,890
over long periods of time,

2652
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:12,720
although there is a
common practice nowadays

2653
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,029
of trying to diminish the dosage overall.

2654
01:39:15,029 --> 01:39:18,030
That's in the context of ADHD
and prescription medication

2655
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:19,706
and I acknowledge that a lot,

2656
01:39:19,706 --> 01:39:24,706
indeed 80% or more of college
students say the statistics

2657
01:39:25,643 --> 01:39:28,440
are using prescription drugs

2658
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,270
when they are not in fact

2659
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:32,040
prescribed those prescription drugs.

2660
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,570
So basically what I'm saying

2661
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:35,100
is there are a lot of people using drugs

2662
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,290
designed for ADHD and narcolepsy

2663
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:38,763
because those drugs

2664
01:39:38,763 --> 01:39:41,940
will effectively increase
focus and concentration,

2665
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,490
but I strongly discourage

2666
01:39:44,490 --> 01:39:46,980
the use of powerful prescription drugs

2667
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:48,210
that have not been prescribed to you.

2668
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:49,080
First of all, it's illegal.

2669
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,820
Second of all, it's quite dangerous

2670
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:53,790
to hit the accelerator
of those neural circuits

2671
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:55,230
with such vigor

2672
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:57,240
because it can increase dependency

2673
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,860
and they can have a number
of other side effects

2674
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:01,050
outside the context of
clinically diagnosed

2675
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:04,385
and prescribed ADHD medication.

2676
01:40:04,385 --> 01:40:07,350
But in the context of supplementation,

2677
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:12,350
the increase in dopamine,
acetylcholine and epinephrine

2678
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:15,120
that one can achieve from say
500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,

2679
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:20,120
300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
and a cup of coffee

2680
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,350
is going to be substantially less

2681
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,060
than one would see for prescription drugs.

2682
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,043
So you're getting a modest effect

2683
01:40:26,043 --> 01:40:29,880
that can similarly teach
those brain circuits

2684
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,030
for focus and concentration
how to engage better.

2685
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:35,820
But as a general backdrop to all of this,

2686
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:38,400
I always say and I'll
say it again and again

2687
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,930
probably until the day I die,

2688
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:41,340
which hopefully is a long time from now,

2689
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,950
but regardless, it'll be the same message,

2690
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:46,923
I always believe that behavioral
tools should come first,

2691
01:40:46,923 --> 01:40:48,660
behavioral tools should come first.

2692
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,250
Then focus on nutrition.

2693
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:52,500
In fact, I would say
behavioral and nutrition tools,

2694
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,635
and of course, get excellent sleep.

2695
01:40:54,635 --> 01:40:58,866
Then focus on supplementation and then,

2696
01:40:58,866 --> 01:41:01,830
and only if those are failing

2697
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:03,450
to bring your brain and body

2698
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:04,590
to the state you need to be in

2699
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:07,419
to perform well in school
and work and life, et cetera

2700
01:41:07,419 --> 01:41:12,240
do I recommend that people
lean on prescription drugs.

2701
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,290
Now there's a caveat to that,

2702
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:16,521
which is in under conditions
like severe eating disorders,

2703
01:41:16,521 --> 01:41:20,105
obsessive compulsive
disorder, bipolar disorder,

2704
01:41:20,105 --> 01:41:25,105
depression where people are
truly at risk of suicide

2705
01:41:25,530 --> 01:41:27,480
or severe mental health effects

2706
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,130
or behavioral health effects

2707
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:31,920
and they're really at,
their lives are at risk

2708
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,033
and their overall mood
and wellbeing is at risk,

2709
01:41:34,033 --> 01:41:37,050
it's often the case that
people cannot access

2710
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:39,060
the brain states required

2711
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:41,250
to shift themselves purely
with behavioral tools,

2712
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,180
nutrition, et cetera.

2713
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:44,910
So again, for the typical person

2714
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:45,840
who's not suffering

2715
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,521
from one of the psychiatric disorders

2716
01:41:47,521 --> 01:41:50,325
that I mentioned before or
other psychiatric disorders,

2717
01:41:50,325 --> 01:41:52,550
schizophrenia, et cetera,

2718
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:56,760
I strongly encourage you to
look to behavioral tools first,

2719
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,610
nutrition, then supplementation,

2720
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:02,910
then and only if there's a remaining need,

2721
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:04,358
to prescription drugs.

2722
01:42:04,358 --> 01:42:06,240
This contrasts very much

2723
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,460
with the typical scenario
I hear about these days

2724
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,890
where college students
or other people will say,

2725
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:12,641
oh yeah, I hear that there's this drug,

2726
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:15,797
Ritalin or Vyvanse that can
immediately put me into a state

2727
01:42:15,797 --> 01:42:17,880
of heightened focus and concentration.

2728
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,680
Now listen, if you have ADHD,

2729
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,840
by all means, talk to a physician,

2730
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,430
talk to a great psychiatrist

2731
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:25,290
and figure out whether or
not that's right for you.

2732
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:26,520
But if you don't,

2733
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,167
again, behavioral tools,
nutrition, supplementation,

2734
01:42:29,167 --> 01:42:32,910
and in particular, those behavioral tools

2735
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:35,130
are going to be the ones
that are going to allow you

2736
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,660
to teach your neural circuits

2737
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:38,130
how to focus and concentrate better,

2738
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:40,230
and I cannot overstate
the importance of that,

2739
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,400
that the behavioral tools,

2740
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,374
and to some extent the supplementation

2741
01:42:43,374 --> 01:42:45,360
combined with behavioral tools

2742
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:48,630
really allow you to train
up your neural circuits

2743
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:50,687
so that you can focus and concentrate

2744
01:42:50,687 --> 01:42:53,550
to the depth and the
degree and the duration

2745
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:56,430
that's going to best serve
your mental and physical goals.

2746
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:57,282
Now there's one other compound

2747
01:42:57,282 --> 01:43:00,418
that I've used from time to
time and that I continue to use

2748
01:43:00,418 --> 01:43:03,327
in order to increase
focus and concentration

2749
01:43:03,327 --> 01:43:06,120
and I will use this in combination

2750
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,010
with the other supplements
I talked about before

2751
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:09,780
and that's phenylethylamine.

2752
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:12,780
Phenylethylamine is in the
dopamine synthesis pathway,

2753
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,610
so it increases dopamine transmission

2754
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:16,560
and tends to function a
little bit differently

2755
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,442
than L-tyrosine.

2756
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:20,850
So every once in a while,
I'll swap out L-tyrosine

2757
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:23,850
and put in 500 milligrams
of phenylethylamine

2758
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:27,210
or sometimes, if I really want
to push a little bit harder

2759
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:28,356
on the dopamine system,

2760
01:43:28,356 --> 01:43:32,190
and I'm going to be doing a
long about of intense work,

2761
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:34,827
I will take the 300
milligrams of Alpha-GPC,

2762
01:43:34,827 --> 01:43:37,350
the 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,

2763
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:39,236
I'll generally take
that with some caffeine,

2764
01:43:39,236 --> 01:43:40,770
and I should mention,

2765
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:43,560
I don't go past about 100 or
200 milligrams of caffeine

2766
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,360
'cause I don't really
like feeling too jittery,

2767
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,290
that's not really my goal,

2768
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:48,360
it's the goal to be alert,

2769
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,360
but not so alert that I really
can't focus on anything,

2770
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,480
I'm not interested in having
an anxiety attack after all,

2771
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,790
but I'll sometimes either swap in

2772
01:43:56,790 --> 01:43:59,874
or I will add that 500
milligrams of phenylethylamine.

2773
01:43:59,874 --> 01:44:02,963
Phenylethylamine is in the PEA pathway.

2774
01:44:02,963 --> 01:44:04,110
I've talked about this

2775
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:07,140
in a previous podcast on
dopamine motivation and drive,

2776
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:10,530
and it's a very short-lived compound.

2777
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:12,066
So what I'll tend to do is take it

2778
01:44:12,066 --> 01:44:13,950
once at the beginning of the workout

2779
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:15,930
and sometimes in the
middle of the workout,

2780
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:18,120
I'll take another 500 milligram capsule.

2781
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,170
But what I just described

2782
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:21,180
with combining all of those compounds,

2783
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:25,332
Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,
phenylethylamine and caffeine,

2784
01:44:25,332 --> 01:44:28,290
that's a fairly rare occurrence
that I'll combine all four

2785
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:29,610
and really only under conditions

2786
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:32,940
in which I have to do an
intensely challenging about

2787
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,830
of mental or physical work.

2788
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:36,630
I would say the frequency
at which I combine

2789
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:38,190
all four of those things

2790
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:40,860
is probably about once every two weeks,

2791
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:43,140
and typically more like once a month,

2792
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:46,290
again being careful to do that
in the early part of the day,

2793
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:48,390
certainly before the noon hour,

2794
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:50,970
so that I am in no way
going to disrupt my sleep.

2795
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:53,130
I realize that many of you
are probably wondering about

2796
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:54,540
or hoping that I'll discuss things

2797
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,150
like lions mane or the racetams

2798
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:59,520
or some of the other compounds

2799
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,440
that are known to powerfully modulate

2800
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,353
the dopamine, epinephrine
and acetylcholine systems.

2801
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,120
To be quite direct,

2802
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:08,010
there are far too many of these compounds

2803
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,780
to review in a single episode,

2804
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:13,560
and they all generally tap
into the same set of processes.

2805
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:16,530
Again, epinephrine, that
shaft of the arrowhead

2806
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:17,766
that we're thinking of as focus,

2807
01:45:17,766 --> 01:45:20,520
acetylcholine, which is
the arrowhead itself,

2808
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,990
and then dopamine,

2809
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:24,630
which is the sort of
propeller behind the arrow

2810
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:26,910
that allows it to
continually drive forward

2811
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:29,553
through a about of
mental or physical work.

2812
01:45:30,450 --> 01:45:31,710
There is a wonderful site.

2813
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:34,260
I've mentioned it several
times before on this podcast.

2814
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,540
That is examine.com.

2815
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:39,120
That wonderful site that is examine.com

2816
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:42,450
has recently been updated,
they've changed their format.

2817
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:43,950
It was terrific before,

2818
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:46,710
it provided links to relevant studies,

2819
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:48,210
it talked about specific compounds,

2820
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:49,770
it talked about the magnitude of effect,

2821
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:51,300
it talked about the human effect matrix,

2822
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,680
it really focused on human studies

2823
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:55,380
with links to those studies and on and on.

2824
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:58,980
The new revamped version of
examine.com is even better,

2825
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:00,690
it's really next, next level.

2826
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:03,450
I really applaud them for
doing such a terrific job

2827
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:04,710
in organizing the information.

2828
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:07,650
There are a lot of interesting
pages that you can read there

2829
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:08,790
about different compounds.

2830
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:11,370
So you can put in any
compound, ginko biloba,

2831
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:14,130
phosphatidylserine, Alpha-GPC,

2832
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:16,170
and you're going to get a
rich array of information

2833
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:17,490
about those compounds.

2834
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:19,890
And if you were to put
in a specific goal state,

2835
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:24,890
that is focus or concentration
or sleep or hormones,

2836
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:26,190
like testosterone, et cetera,

2837
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:28,530
you're going to get a rich array

2838
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:30,900
of compounds and supplements

2839
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:33,030
as well as links to the
studies on those compounds

2840
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:34,920
and some details about
those particular studies.

2841
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,720
It's an absolutely phenomenal site.

2842
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,300
It's one that I rely on
and that I know thousands,

2843
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:40,888
if not millions of other people rely on

2844
01:46:40,888 --> 01:46:42,780
and I encourage you to check it out.

2845
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:45,990
Again, the URL is examine.com.

2846
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:48,477
So today we've talked about
a number of different tools

2847
01:46:48,477 --> 01:46:50,250
and to some extent, some mechanisms

2848
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,710
involved in concentration and focus,

2849
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:54,690
and really the goal
has been to provide you

2850
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:56,310
an understanding of the
neurochemical systems

2851
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:58,199
and a little bit about the neurocircuits

2852
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:03,030
that can allow you to achieve
states of attention and focus.

2853
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:04,470
In contrast to previous episodes

2854
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:05,670
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2855
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:07,150
where I've covered these topics

2856
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:10,380
in tremendous depth as
it relates to mechanism

2857
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:11,520
and also focused on tools,

2858
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,580
today, I largely focused on tools.

2859
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:16,740
So we talked about behavioral tools,

2860
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:20,970
like a meditation that's
13 minutes long done daily

2861
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:23,130
specifically to improve
your ability to focus,

2862
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:25,490
and in fact, there are data
to support that it will.

2863
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:28,500
We talked about hypnosis, we
talked about visual focus,

2864
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,700
overt and covert,

2865
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,380
we talked about various supplements,

2866
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:35,070
such as Alpha-GPC,
phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,

2867
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:36,270
supplements that I use

2868
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:38,280
to directly modulate the neural circuits

2869
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,900
for concentration and focus.

2870
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,420
We also talked about
creatine and the omega-3s.

2871
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,770
We talked about the importance of sleep,

2872
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:45,151
which modulates our ability

2873
01:47:45,151 --> 01:47:48,270
to function mentally
and physically overall,

2874
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:50,460
so optimize that sleep.

2875
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,890
And we talked about a
number of other protocols

2876
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:54,120
that you can incorporate.

2877
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,830
My hope in giving you all this information

2878
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:57,960
in one single location
is that you'll be able

2879
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,640
to pick and choose

2880
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,490
which of these protocols you
would like to incorporate

2881
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:05,940
into your attempts to improve
your focus and concentration.

2882
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:07,320
Again, I don't recommend

2883
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:10,120
doing all of these protocols all at once.

2884
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,630
What I recommend is
picking a handful of them,

2885
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,880
maybe one or two, maybe three or four,

2886
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,719
and trying them in different combinations

2887
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:19,230
at different times of day
and for different purposes,

2888
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:21,000
for mental work, for
physical work, et cetera,

2889
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,800
and find what is best for you.

2890
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,541
Once again, the goal
is to teach your brain,

2891
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:30,180
that is to increase neuroplasticity
in the neural circuits

2892
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,800
that allow you not just to focus,

2893
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,840
but to refocus your attention.

2894
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,037
And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

2895
01:48:36,037 --> 01:48:39,300
that it's also critical
to be able to defocus.

2896
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:42,671
I highly encourage people to
take a period of time each day

2897
01:48:42,671 --> 01:48:44,850
to daydream, to walk down the hall

2898
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:46,620
without looking at your phone,

2899
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:49,950
to not have to incorporate
more sensory information,

2900
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:52,710
to not place increasing
demands on yourself to focus,

2901
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:55,800
and see and realize how having a period

2902
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,740
of deliberate decompression and defocusing

2903
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,320
can allow your brain
to focus so much better

2904
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,080
when you do decide to return to a about

2905
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,170
of focus, concentrated
work or physical work.

2906
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:09,600
So I want to thank you for
joining me for this discussion

2907
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,780
about tools for focus and concentration.

2924
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:50,460
During today's episode and
on many previous episodes

2925
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:53,160
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we discuss supplements.

2926
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,290
while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

2927
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:57,480
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

2928
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,550
for things like sleep and enhancing focus

2929
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,740
and hormone augmentation and so forth.

2930
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:03,720
As mentioned at the
beginning of today's episode,

2931
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,770
the Huberman Lab Podcast

2932
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:06,540
is now partnered with
Momentous supplements

2933
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,940
because they are of the
very highest quality,

2934
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:10,200
they ship internationally,

2935
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,450
and they have single
ingredient formulations

2936
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:14,370
in dosages that will allow you

2937
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:15,840
to construct the best,

2938
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,670
most biologically and cost effective

2939
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:19,950
supplementation protocol for your needs.

2940
01:50:19,950 --> 01:50:21,510
If you're interested in the supplements

2941
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:23,460
covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2942
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:26,220
you can go to livemomentous,
spelled o-u-s,

2943
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:29,010
so livemomentous.com/huberman.

2944
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:31,140
If you're not already
following us on social media,

2945
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:32,610
we are hubermanlab on Twitter,

2946
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:34,710
and we are also hubermanlab on Instagram.

2947
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:37,740
Both places, I talk about science
and science related tools,

2948
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:40,740
some of which overlap with
the contents and topics

2949
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,240
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2950
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,250
much of which is unique from the contents

2951
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:45,600
and it's certainly the format covered

2952
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,710
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2953
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:48,540
Again, that's hubermanlab on Instagram

2954
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,190
and hubermanlab on Twitter.

2955
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:52,470
The Huberman Lab Podcast has a newsletter

2956
01:50:52,470 --> 01:50:55,590
in which we provide summaries
and essential protocols

2957
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:57,840
from the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.

2958
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,790
You can access it totally free of charge

2959
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,309
by going to hubermanlab.com,

2960
01:51:01,309 --> 01:51:03,810
go to the menu and click on newsletter,

2961
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:04,920
provide your email.

2962
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:06,900
We do not share your email with anybody

2963
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,610
and you'll receive our monthly newsletter.

2964
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:10,950
There are also examples of
previous newsletters there

2965
01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:12,510
that you can download as PDFs

2966
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,490
right away without even having to sign up.

2967
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:15,390
So thank you once again

2968
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:16,950
for joining me for today's discussion

2969
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:19,590
all about the mechanisms
and especially the tools

2970
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,691
for enhancing concentration and focus,

2971
01:51:21,691 --> 01:51:23,996
and last but certainly not least,

2972
01:51:23,996 --> 01:51:26,962
thank you for your interest in science.

2973
01:51:26,962 --> 01:51:29,629
