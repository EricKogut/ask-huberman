00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,350
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,417
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:10,890
- My name is Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,258
and I'm a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:15,980
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,200
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,268
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:21,740
It is however part of my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,760
to bring zero-cost to consumer
information about science

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,890
and science-related tools
to the general public.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,015
In keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:32,320
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,532
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

15
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:37,656
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

16
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:40,456
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

17
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:42,600
to help you better understand your body

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,500
and inform your health goals.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,040
I'm a big believer in
getting blood test taken,

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,095
because it's simply the only
way to get in-depth data

21
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,711
about your metabolic factors, hormones,

22
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,050
all the things that inform your immediate

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,448
and long-term health.

24
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:58,987
Nowadays, there are
also excellent DNA tests

25
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,770
that can further inform you

26
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,200
about your immediate and long-term health.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,740
Now the problem with most
blood tests out there

28
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,190
is that you get information
back, you get a lot of numbers,

29
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,110
and they'll tell you whether or not

30
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,663
your numbers are in normal
range or high or low,

31
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:12,990
but they don't inform you

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,729
what steps to take as a consequence.

33
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,270
In addition, they can
often be very confusing,

34
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,650
what all the factors are
and what they really mean.

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,320
InsideTracker has a
dashboard and a platform

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,490
that makes interpreting all
that information really easy.

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,120
It also points you in the direction

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,650
of certain lifestyle factors,
exercise, nutrition et cetera,

39
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,660
that you might want to change

40
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,555
in order to bring the numbers
into the ranges that you want.

41
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:36,130
So InsideTracker is something

42
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,750
that I've been doing for some time now,

43
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,890
and it's really helped
me inform the choices.

44
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,190
For instance, I've swapped out

45
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,050
some of the foods that
I was eating regularly.

46
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,800
I found out I was actually too high

47
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,270
in certain vitamins and minerals,

48
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,670
I was too low in others.

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,130
It's really helped me adjust my diet

50
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,770
and my exercise regimes.

51
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,040
And it really gives me the confidence

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,460
that I'm on the path to long-term health.

53
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,000
So if you want to try InsideTracker,

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,290
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,630
to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

56
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,730
Use the code Huberman at checkout,

57
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,350
that's insidetracker.com/huberman

58
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,190
to get 25% off any of InsidTracker's plans

59
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,690
and use the code Huberman at checkout.

60
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,115
Our next sponsor is ExpressVPN.

61
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:19,010
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

62
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,460
that keeps your data safe

63
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,240
and secure and private.

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,450
It does that by routing
your internet activity

65
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,600
through their servers and encrypting it

66
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,875
so that no one can see or sell your data.

67
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,010
I started using ExpressVPN

68
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,450
because my bank account got hacked.

69
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,070
I still don't know
exactly how it happened,

70
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,170
but it was an absolute mess.

71
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,050
I lost money,

72
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,320
I lost a lot of time.

73
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,613
I wouldn't want to have
it happen to anybody.

74
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,880
When that happened,

75
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,374
I talked to my friends
in the tech community

76
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,400
and they told me that even though

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,610
you think your internet
connection is secure

78
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,987
oftentimes it's not.

79
00:02:49,987 --> 00:02:51,900
So I tend to use internet connections

80
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,940
on planes, in hotels, in
cafes, but also at home.

81
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,094
And I was told that even at home,

82
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,340
your data may not be
as secure as you think.

83
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,730
And so with ExpressVPN, your
data is absolutely secure,

84
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,650
so are your online activities.

85
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,550
The great thing is

86
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,710
you don't even notice that it's operating,

87
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,830
it's running in the background.

88
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,010
You just turn it on and it
goes without you realizing

89
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,480
that your data is being protected,

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,904
it doesn't interfere with any
of your online activities.

91
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:19,731
So I use ExpressVPN when I travel,

92
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,270
anytime I'm outside the
house, when I'm at work

93
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,790
and when I'm at home.

94
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,096
If you want to try ExpressVPN,

95
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:29,580
you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman.

96
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,044
And if you do that, you'll
get an extra three months free

97
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,490
on one of their one-year packages.

98
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,730
That's expressvpn.com/huberman

99
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,359
to get three months free
on a one-year package.

100
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,430
The final sponsor of today's
podcast is Magic Spoon.

101
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,150
Magic Spoon is a zero-sugar,

102
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,319
grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.

103
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,280
As I've mentioned before on the podcast,

104
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,230
I'm neither ketogenic, nor am
I all-meat, nor am I vegan.

105
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,960
The way I eat is that
early in the day I fast,

106
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,210
and then sometime around
noon I eat my first meal,

107
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,760
and that meal is always low carbohydrate,

108
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,810
and then throughout the day,

109
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,230
I maintain a low carbohydrate diet.

110
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,780
The fasting and low carbohydrate
diet during the daytime

111
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,760
optimizes alertness and wakefulness,

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
I want to be awake and be able to work.

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,830
And then at night is when
I eat my carbohydrates,

114
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,200
'cause it facilitates
the transition to sleep.

115
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,793
So for me, Magic Spoon is a
terrific snack in the afternoon.

116
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:24,200
I'll sometimes even have it with lunch.

117
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,180
And the reason I like it

118
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,930
is because it tastes really delicious,

119
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,680
and it's compatible with the keto-friendly

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,224
or keto-like meals that
I eat throughout the day.

121
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,693
They come in a variety of flavors,

122
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:37,590
cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.

123
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,170
I particularly like the frosted

124
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,350
because it tastes like
donuts, in my opinion,

125
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,940
and I love donuts.

126
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,773
As a consequence,

127
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,486
I love Magic Spoon cereal.

128
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,680
I can consume it.

129
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,430
It tastes like a pastry and
it has zero grams of sugar,

130
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,263
and it's compatible

131
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:54,120
with this nutritional
regimen I mentioned earlier.

132
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,530
If you want to try Magic Spoon,

133
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,390
you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman

134
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,704
to grab a variety pack.

135
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:04,210
Use the code Huberman at checkout
and get $5 off your order.

136
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,670
That's magicspoon.com/huberman,

137
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,760
and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

138
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,086
This month, we're talking all
about the science of emotions

139
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:15,002
and tools related to
the science of emotions.

140
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:18,239
We've talked about the science
of stress and resiliency,

141
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,620
tools to access more calm,

142
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,120
tools raise your stress threshold,
to become more resilient.

143
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,420
We've talked about motivation

144
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,074
and the role of the dopamine system.

145
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:29,290
I'd like to make a couple of announcements

146
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,786
about some new resources.

147
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:33,525
The first one is that
we have now captioned

148
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,448
all the Huberman Lab episodes

149
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,434
in English and in Spanish.

150
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,770
We were able to do that,

151
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,706
thanks to your support of
our sponsors and on Patreon.

152
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,370
So now, all of the podcasts

153
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,347
have a captioning feature on YouTube,

154
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,707
and those were done by experts.

155
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:51,335
So while there might be
the occasional error,

156
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,746
for the most part, they're very precise.

157
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:54,920
We've done that

158
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,792
so that people that prefer to
consume the content in Spanish

159
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,030
or that like to read the content

160
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,350
from the English subtitles can do so.

161
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,450
And we're going to continue

162
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,040
to expand the number of
languages that are captioned

163
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,270
for the Huberman Lab Podcast.

164
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,828
So we want to thank you for that resource.

165
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,900
It's now available for all episodes.

166
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,190
In addition, in previous episodes

167
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,550
I've talked about NSDR
or non-sleep depressed.

168
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,410
NSDRs come in in a variety
of different forms,

169
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,690
there's self-hypnosis.

170
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,530
I've pointed you to some
resources for that previously.

171
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,220
There's yoga nidra.

172
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,990
NSDR is really about
achieving calm quickly,

173
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,270
and doing that in a self-directed
way, for many reasons,

174
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,290
in order to access sleep more readily,

175
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,710
in order to de-stress very deeply,

176
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,374
in order to replace
sleep that you've lost.

177
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:45,310
It also seems to aid neuroplasticity.

178
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,170
It can enhance

179
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,070
the rearrangements of
connections in the brain

180
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,060
that occur during learning,

181
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,559
there's scientific support for that.

182
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:56,559
There's a link in today's
episode caption to a new site.

183
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:58,094
This is a YouTube video

184
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,850
that was brought free of cost

185
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,440
by the folks over at Madefor,

186
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,990
a company that's been a sponsor
of the podcast previously.

187
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,302
So this is an NSDR script

188
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,908
that doesn't contain any of the intentions

189
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:14,060
or some of the more typical
language of yoga nidra,

190
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,536
instead it's focused purely
on the breathing protocols,

191
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,020
as well as includes a sort of body scan

192
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,853
where you direct

193
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:22,970
your attention to different
locations around your body.

194
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,162
It has all the core elements
of non-sleep deep rest,

195
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,902
but is distinct from yoga nidra.

196
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,280
I just offer this to you as a resource.

197
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,370
If you'd like to use it,

198
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,120
it's about 30 minutes long,
and should be very effective

199
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,350
in bringing you into
deep states of relaxation

200
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,100
for all the reasons I mentioned before.

201
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,900
So let's talk about emotions.

202
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,470
Emotions are a fascinating

203
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,913
and vital aspect of our life experience.

204
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,960
It's fair to say that emotions

205
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,960
make up most of what we think
of as our experience of life,

206
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,026
even the things we do,

207
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:55,077
our behaviors and the places we go,

208
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:57,639
and the people we end up
encountering in our life,

209
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,450
all of that really funnels
into our emotional perception

210
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,181
of what those things mean,
whether or not they made us happy

211
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:10,181
or sad or depressed or
lonely, or were all inspiring.

212
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,630
Now one thing that is absolutely true

213
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,820
is that everyone's perception of emotion

214
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,033
is slightly different.

215
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:20,280
Meaning, your idea of happy
is very likely different

216
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,626
than my idea of what a
state of happiness is.

217
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:27,720
And we know this also for
color vision, for instance,

218
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,098
even though the cells
in your eye and my eye

219
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:33,640
that perceive the color red are identical

220
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,599
right down to the genes that they express,

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,177
we can be certain based
on experimental evidence,

222
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,186
and what are called
psychophysical studies,

223
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:45,540
that your idea of the most intense red

224
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,570
is going to be very different

225
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,840
than my idea of the most intense red

226
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,050
if we were given a selection
of 10 different reds

227
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,700
and asked which one is most intense,

228
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,980
which one looks most red,

229
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,200
and that seems crazy,

230
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,790
you would think that
something as simple as color

231
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,962
would be universal, and yet it's not.

232
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:03,135
And so we need to agree at the outset

233
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:07,450
that emotions are complicated
and yet they are tractable.

234
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,650
They can be understood.

235
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,990
And today we're going to talk about

236
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,421
a lot of tools to
understand what emotions are

237
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:16,750
for you to understand what
your emotional states mean

238
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,250
and what they don't mean.

239
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,620
And in doing that, that will
allow you to place value

240
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,453
on whether or not

241
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:25,740
you should hold an emotional
state as true or not true,

242
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,170
whether or not it has
meaning or it doesn't,

243
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,040
as well as whether or not
the emotions of others

244
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,032
are important to you in a given context.

245
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:35,390
We're going to talk a
lot about development.

246
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,330
In fact, we're going to center

247
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,891
a lot of our discussion today
around infancy and puberty.

248
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,840
We're also going to talk about tools

249
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,798
for enhancing one's emotional range

250
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:48,490
and for navigating difficult
emotional situations.

251
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,060
I'm not a clinical psychologist,

252
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,896
I'm not a therapist,

253
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,627
but I do have some
background in psychology.

254
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,090
And today I'm going to be drawing

255
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,200
from the psychology greats, not me,

256
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,230
but from the greats of
psychology who studied emotion,

257
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,884
who studied emotional development,

258
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,420
and linking that to the
neuroscience of emotion.

259
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,720
Because nowadays we understand
a lot about the chemicals

260
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,670
and the hormones and the neural circuits

261
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,260
in the brain and body
that underlie emotion.

262
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,240
So while there's no

263
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,358
one single universally
true theory of emotion,

264
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:20,660
at the intersection of many
of the existing theories,

265
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,970
there are really some ground truth.

266
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,893
So today we're going to
visit those ground truths.

267
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:26,440
We're going to talk about the
tools that emerge from them.

268
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,310
And we're going to talk about

269
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,730
some absolutely wild and wacky experiments

270
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,520
that people are doing out there right now,

271
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,650
that I don't necessarily recommend you do,

272
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,460
of inhaling different types of hormones

273
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,420
and trying to get attached more quickly.

274
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,253
You're actually going to do

275
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:40,180
some experiential stuff today if you like.

276
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,910
There's some things that
you can do in real time

277
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,987
while listening to the podcast,

278
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,180
in order to tap into

279
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,190
some of the mechanisms
that I'll be referring to.

280
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,780
So today's going to be very interactive

281
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,740
in a way that previous
podcast episodes have not.

282
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,319
If we want to understand emotions,

283
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,356
we have to look at where
emotions first develop.

284
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,180
In fact, this is a critical central theme

285
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,019
if you want to understand
brain science and psychology.

286
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,447
There's a rule in neuroanatomy.

287
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:09,200
Because if you look at 50
different brains of humans

288
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,120
or you compare the brains
of dogs and humans,

289
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,540
there are a lot of differences.

290
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,430
Certain things are the same

291
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,870
but certain things are different.

292
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,840
And the rule that every
good neuroanatomist knows

293
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,430
is that if you want to understand

294
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,036
what a part of the brain does,

295
00:11:22,036 --> 00:11:23,910
you have to address two questions.

296
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,946
First, you have to know what connections

297
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,670
does that brain area make?

298
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,640
What is it connected to?

299
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,650
Where does it get inputs from
and where does it send inputs?

300
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,830
So for instance, if there's
an area of the brain

301
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,863
that gets direct input from
the neurons in the nose,

302
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,150
you can be pretty certain

303
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,170
that it has some role in analyzing smell

304
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,530
in measuring something about odors

305
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,223
or analyzing something about odors.

306
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:50,790
Now if it also gets input from the eye,

307
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,720
you can also conclude that it gets input

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,084
from the visual system that it cares about

309
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,080
light and photons.

310
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,019
This is sort of obvious.

311
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,246
And yet you need to
know that connectivity,

312
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:03,330
and you need to know what's called

313
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,630
the developmental origin
of that structure.

314
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,224
You need to know where it
was early in development,

315
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:11,630
because things move around
a lot as the brain develops.

316
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,490
The brain, of course

317
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,354
is this more or less squishy thing

318
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:16,010
floating around in some liquid

319
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,830
that stuffed inside your skull.

320
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,130
And as a consequence,
things move around a lot.

321
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,680
They are not always in the same place

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,336
in two different species

323
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:26,137
or two individuals of the same species.

324
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:28,530
So you have to know
where they started out,

325
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,800
because where they started out

326
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,351
informs what they do as well.

327
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,049
And when we're talking about emotions,

328
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:36,060
we cannot point to one area of the brain.

329
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
We can't say that's the area of the brain

330
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,496
that's responsible for emotions.

331
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:41,758
There is this so-called limbic system

332
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:45,640
that has been linked to
emotions in various ways.

333
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,056
We're going to talk about that today.

334
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:49,685
But the limbic system
is just one component

335
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,450
of the inputs to create emotions.

336
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,100
It's not the place for emotions.

337
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,398
You can't go in and lesion
one location in the brain

338
00:12:57,398 --> 00:13:02,398
and eliminate emotions entirely,
just doesn't work that way.

339
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,684
So, first of all, we have to ask,

340
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,210
what are the circuits for emotion?

341
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,800
What are the brain areas for emotion?

342
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,080
And nowadays there's a
lot of debate about this.

343
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,823
For years, it was thought
that there might be circuits,

344
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:15,570
meaning connections in the brain

345
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,270
that generate the feeling of being happy

346
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,410
or circuits that generate

347
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,349
the feeling of being sad, et cetera.

348
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,360
That's been challenged.

349
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,700
In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett

350
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,400
has been the person who's
really challenged this head-on,

351
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,600
and has very good evidence

352
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,640
for the fact that such
circuits probably don't exist.

353
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,286
And yet I think there's good evidence

354
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,350
for circuits in the brain,

355
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,462
such as limbic circuits and other circuits

356
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:40,070
that shift our overall states

357
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,360
or our overall level of
alertness or calmness,

358
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,193
or whether they're not,

359
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,740
they bias us toward
viewing the outside world

360
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,980
or paying more attention

361
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,119
to what's going on inside our bodies.

362
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,840
If none of this makes sense right now,

363
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,370
I promise it will make sense soon.

364
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,010
But the important thing to understand

365
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,372
is that emotions do arise
in the brain and body.

366
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,221
They arise because there
are specific connections

367
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:03,907
between specific areas
in the brain and body.

368
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:07,670
And if we want to understand
how emotions work,

369
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,089
we have to look how emotions are built.

370
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:15,089
And they are built during
infancy, adolescence, and puberty,

371
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,510
and then it continues into adulthood.

372
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,440
But the groundwork is laid
down early in development

373
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,340
when we are small children.

374
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,210
So let's think about

375
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,625
what happens to a baby
that comes into the world.

376
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,440
A baby comes into the world.

377
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,460
You were born into this world

378
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,901
without really any understanding
of the things around you.

379
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:36,700
Now, there are two ways that
you can interact with the world

380
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,850
and you're always doing them more or less

381
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,065
to some degree at the same time.

382
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:43,790
Those are interoception,

383
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,360
paying attention what's
going on inside you,

384
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,730
what you feel internally,

385
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,740
and exteroception,

386
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,420
paying attention to what's
going on outside you.

387
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,750
Hold that in mind, please.

388
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,650
Because the fact that
you're both interocepting

389
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,930
and exterocepting is true
for your entire life,

390
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,230
and it sets the foundation
for understanding emotions.

391
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,556
It's absolutely critical.

392
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,633
As an infant,

393
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,280
you didn't have any
knowledge of what you needed.

394
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,760
You didn't understand hunger,

395
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,180
you didn't understand toys

396
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,280
when you first came into the world,

397
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,758
you didn't understand cold
or heat or any of that.

398
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:20,609
When you needed something, you
experienced that as anxiety.

399
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:23,160
You would feel an increase in alertness

400
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,018
if you had to use the bathroom.

401
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:27,320
you would feel an increase in alertness

402
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,209
if you were hungry,

403
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:29,930
and you would vocalize,

404
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,410
you would cry out, you would act agitated.

405
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,900
You might cue, you might do
a number of different things,

406
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,572
but all you knew was what
you were feeling internally.

407
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,100
And then your caregiver,

408
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,580
whoever that might've been
would respond to that.

409
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,873
So you would feel some agitation,

410
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,270
a caregiver would come
and make a decision,

411
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,130
Oh, you need food, and give you milk,

412
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,750
or change your diaper
or wrap you in a blanket

413
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,696
if you were cold,

414
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,620
but they didn't know if you were cold,

415
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,700
they could just assume that you were cold.

416
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,790
So this is actually really
important to understand

417
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,060
that a baby, when you were a
baby, and when I was a baby,

418
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,590
we didn't have any sense
of the outside world

419
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,590
except that it responded to our
acts of anxiety essentially.

420
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,330
Now this isn't Freudian theory,

421
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,030
There are components of it

422
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,520
that are embedded in Freudian theory,

423
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,290
but all developmental
psychologists agree that

424
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,694
babies lack the ability

425
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:23,153
to make cognitive sense
of the outside world,

426
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:26,230
but in this feeling of anxiety

427
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,330
and registering one's own internal state,

428
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,380
and then crying out to the outside world,

429
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,851
either through crying
or subtle vocalizations,

430
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:35,641
or even just cuing, making some noise,

431
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:39,350
we start to develop a relationship
with the outside world

432
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,830
in which our internal states,

433
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,642
our shifts and anxiety
start to drive requests,

434
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:48,870
and people come and respond
to those requests, hopefully.

435
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,730
And the reason I say hopefully

436
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,703
is that we've all heard

437
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:54,750
presumably about these cases of neglect.

438
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,340
There are a lot of cases
where if you neglect a baby,

439
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,930
you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,

440
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,630
development doesn't go well,

441
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,980
and we'll touch on some of those.

442
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,560
But those are really extreme cases.

443
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,160
They're sort of like the
parallel to experiments

444
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,059
that are often done in the
laboratory with animals,

445
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,440
where you've probably heard
of these enriched environments

446
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,640
where they'll give mice a bunch of toys,

447
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,632
and they'll give them

448
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,119
some different foods
every once in a while,

449
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,809
and they'll house them
together with other mice.

450
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,109
And then what you find
is that the animals,

451
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,349
they will say, "Oh, their brain is thicker

452
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,479
and their neurons have more
branches to them and all that."

453
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,047
But that's really comparing
deprivation with normalcy.

454
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,409
What we want to center on today instead

455
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:35,547
is what happens when things go well,

456
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:38,820
and why things might not go well

457
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,590
in certain circumstances is interesting.

458
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,020
But to me, not as interesting

459
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,240
as what healthy emotional
development looks like.

460
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,470
And if you haven't achieved
healthy emotional development,

461
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,900
what can be done as an intervention

462
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,320
at later times in order to rescue that?

463
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,959
So the baby, you as a baby,

464
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,482
you're flopping around there in your crib,

465
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:59,040
you're getting care where you need it

466
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,471
and when you need it, presumably,

467
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:05,471
and this gets to the basis
of what emotions are about,

468
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,533
which are emotions are
really about forming bonds

469
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,558
and being able to predict
things in the world.

470
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,174
That's really what emotions are about.

471
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:18,180
Whether or not the baby
feels angry or happy or sad,

472
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,600
we don't know, we can
guess, but we don't know.

473
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,700
In fact, most of the time we
don't even know how we feel,

474
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,030
let alone how other people feel,

475
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,170
and that's true for adults.

476
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,609
So if I asked you how you feel right now,

477
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,640
I don't know that you could tell me

478
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,387
in any kind of rich
language that I would say,

479
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,150
"Oh I really understand."

480
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,070
If you said you were very, very depressed

481
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,040
or very, very happy,

482
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,710
I'd have some sense because
of how extreme that is,

483
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,190
but I don't know that I would really know,

484
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,230
and I don't think you know
how I feel right now either.

485
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,601
I could be furious right now

486
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:45,860
or I could be very happy,

487
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,906
you don't have any idea.

488
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,951
And of course, we have these
things called expressions,

489
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:50,560
our pupils dilate.

490
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,690
There are various cues of how people feel.

491
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,752
We're going to talk about those cues,

492
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,124
but you really don't know.

493
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,640
And at this point I
actually just want to pause

494
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,985
and mention a really interesting tool

495
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,680
that is trying to address this question

496
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,788
of what are emotions and
what do they consist of,

497
00:19:04,788 --> 00:19:06,900
that you can use if you like.

498
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,733
This is an app,

499
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:08,566
I didn't develop it,

500
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:09,708
I don't have any relationship to them,

501
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,923
but the app was developed
by people at Yale,

502
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,375
by groups at Yale who do research,

503
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,000
and it's called Mood Meter.

504
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,460
And it's actually quite interesting.

505
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,320
I think it's either free or it's 0.99.

506
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,180
Again, no business relationship to them.

507
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,150
But what they're trying
to do is put more nuance,

508
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,090
more subtlety on our words,

509
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,980
and our language for emotions,

510
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,740
and be able to allow you

511
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,170
to predict how you're going
to feel in the future.

512
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,560
And it's actually quite interesting.

513
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,610
I'm on the app right now, and
I know you can't see this,

514
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,960
but it's called Mood Meter.

515
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,285
And you can find on Apple or Android.

516
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,181
And you go into and it asks you,

517
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:50,380
it says to me, "Hi, Andrew,
how are you right now?

518
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,390
And I click the little
tab that says I feel.

519
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,560
And I can either pick high
energy and unpleasant,

520
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,450
high energy and pleasant,
low energy unpleasant

521
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,880
or low energy pleasant.

522
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,800
And I would say right now I
feel high energy pleasant.

523
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,370
So I just revealed to you how I feel.

524
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,454
So I click on that,

525
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:11,540
and then it gives you a gallery of colors,

526
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,153
and you just move your
finger to the location

527
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,860
where you think it matches most.

528
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,592
And as you do that, little words pop up.

529
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,950
I know some people are
listening to this on audio only.

530
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,980
So it say motivated, cheerful, inspired.

531
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,668
I would say, I'm feeling
right now, cheerful.

532
00:20:24,668 --> 00:20:27,780
So you click that and then you
just go to the next window,

533
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,017
and it just says, what are you doing?

534
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,930
And this feels like play to me,

535
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,150
but I'm going to call it work.

536
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,540
And then that's it.

537
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,560
And then what it does

538
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,300
is it basically starts
to collect data on you.

539
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,450
You're giving it information.

540
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,455
And it starts to link
that to other features

541
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:43,487
that you allowed access to if you like,

542
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:46,110
and it starts helping
you be able to predict

543
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,320
how you're going to feel
different times a day.

544
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,455
It's actually quite
accurate in certain ways,

545
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:51,442
quite interesting.

546
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:55,100
And it points to a couple of
really interesting features,

547
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,280
which is that we don't
really have enough language

548
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,229
to describe all the emotional states,

549
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:02,627
and yet there's some core truths

550
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,700
to what makes up an emotion.

551
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,790
And I want to review that
twice during today's podcast,

552
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,240
because this can really help people,

553
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,710
kids and adults understand better

554
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,080
what they're feeling and why,

555
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,537
and when best to engage
in certain activities,

556
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:22,370
and thankfully, when best to
avoid certain activities too.

557
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,363
So the way this works is the following.

558
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,038
You need to ask yourself at any point,

559
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,900
you could do this right now if you like,

560
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,420
what's your level of autonomic arousal?

561
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,750
Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,

562
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,890
the range of alert to calm.

563
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,890
So if you're in a panic right now,

564
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,300
you are like 10 out of
10 on the arousal scale.

565
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,337
If you're asleep,

566
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:49,185
you're probably not
comprehending what I'm saying,

567
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:51,080
although maybe a little bit.

568
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,480
But let's say you're very drowsy,

569
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,424
you might be at a one or a two.

570
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:57,210
So you always have to ask,

571
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,440
where are you on the arousal scale?

572
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,571
And then there's this other
axis, this other question,

573
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:06,310
which is what we call valence.

574
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,760
Now valence is a value.

575
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,370
Do you feel good or bad?

576
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,650
I would say I feel pretty good right now.

577
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,970
On a scale of one to 10,

578
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,021
I'm like, I dunno, I feel like a seven.

579
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,525
Got good night's sleep last night,

580
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,438
had a good walk with
Costello this morning,

581
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,370
I'm fed, I'm hydrated.

582
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,203
I feel good,

583
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,036
So I'm like a seven.

584
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:24,325
So I'm alert and I feel pretty good.

585
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,510
And then there's a third thing,

586
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,090
which is how much we are interocepting

587
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,138
and how much we are exterocepting.

588
00:22:32,138 --> 00:22:35,141
So how much our attention
is focused internally

589
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:39,089
on what we're feeling and how
much it's focused externally.

590
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,303
And this is always going
to be in a dynamic balance.

591
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:46,050
So for instance, if you're
really, really stressed,

592
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,090
oftentimes that puts you in a position

593
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,270
to be really in touch with
what's going on in your body.

594
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,100
If you start having a lot of somatic,

595
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,480
a lot of bodily sensations,

596
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,062
like your heart is beating so
fast that you can't ignore it,

597
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:59,490
then you're really strongly interoceptive.

598
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,040
But also sometimes you're really stressed

599
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,330
because someone's stressing you out

600
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,528
or somebody sends you a text message

601
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:05,650
or makes a comment about

602
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,720
a YouTube thing you posted or something,

603
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,070
and you're really triggered by it.

604
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,020
That never happens to me.

605
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,390
But if it does happen to you,
then you're exterocepting.

606
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,430
So these three things,

607
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,797
how alert or sleepy you are, that's one,

608
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,640
how good or bad you feel, that's two,

609
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,473
and then whether or not

610
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:23,490
most of your attention
is directed outward,

611
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,720
or whether or not it's directed inward.

612
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,770
And much of what we call emotions

613
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,200
are made up by those three things.

614
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,140
And so let's return now to development,

615
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,150
but tuck that away and just
kind of think about it,

616
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,613
alert versus asleep, good versus bad,

617
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:41,430
and focused internally
or focused externally.

618
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,527
Because when I looked at

619
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:47,070
all the theories of emotion
that were out there,

620
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,802
there were a lot of
different components to them,

621
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,390
but they all seem to center back

622
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,090
to these same three features

623
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,560
in some way or to some degree or another.

624
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,220
And it can be very powerful to understand

625
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,499
and look at your emotions
through that lens.

626
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,630
So let's return to the infant.

627
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,146
There's the baby in the crib.

628
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,069
It's mostly interocepting.

629
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:10,270
As caregivers bring it
what it needs, you hope,

630
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,080
milk, diaper changes, et cetera,

631
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,210
a warm blanket if it's cold,

632
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,290
pull off the blanket

633
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,220
when the baby's fussing and it's too warm,

634
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,798
'cause babies get too warm also,

635
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:21,923
it starts to exterocept.

636
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,680
Excuse me, I misspoke,

637
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,513
I want to be very clear,

638
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:27,800
it starts to exterocept.

639
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,380
The baby starts to look
into the outside world

640
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,420
and start making predictions.

641
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,198
It starts wondering how much
it needs to cry or predicting,

642
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:40,210
"Well, if I cry like a little bit,

643
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,632
then mom comes over and I get my milk.

644
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:48,200
Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't
come over and give me milk,

645
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,732
so I need to really scream
at the top of my head."

646
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:55,510
So babies are starting to
evaluate and do all this,

647
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,858
but they're not doing it consciously.

648
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:59,350
They're doing this strategically

649
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,958
in order to relieve anxiety.

650
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:05,300
And I won't propose that that's
what we do into adulthood.

651
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,550
But a lot of what we do in adulthood

652
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,980
is when we feel something,
we start exterocepting.

653
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,813
Some people are much better

654
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:13,530
at just sitting as a container
and just interocepting

655
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,523
and paying attention to what
they're feeling internally.

656
00:25:15,523 --> 00:25:18,295
But most people do a little
bit of a balance of both.

657
00:25:18,295 --> 00:25:19,420
We don't feel good,

658
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,260
so we look for an item or food

659
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,400
that might make us feel better.

660
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,080
We're feeling anxious
heading into the dentist

661
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,913
or something like that,

662
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:26,746
so we text somebody.

663
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:28,450
We do this almost reflexively,

664
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,678
it's not always conscious.

665
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:33,564
So infants do this, and
we continue to do this.

666
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:35,500
We start to now balance our interoceptive

667
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,762
and exteroceptive focus,

668
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:42,170
looking inward and looking outward.

669
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,350
And as we do that,

670
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,770
we're starting to figure
out what gets our needs met.

671
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,510
Remember, emotions are
really there to form bonds

672
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,800
and to make predictions.

673
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,880
And so our needs are going to
be met to some degree or not.

674
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,950
Sometimes sadly there is neglect.

675
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,480
Sometimes people don't show up for us

676
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,830
the way that we would like.

677
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,424
And in general, our responses to that

678
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:04,590
have to do with whether or not

679
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,140
we predict whether or
not they would or not.

680
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,450
When we expect something
and it doesn't happen,

681
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,400
It's a big let down.

682
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,950
That was the discussion
about dopamine last episode.

683
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,620
So the many theories of emotion,
the triune brain theory,

684
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,480
that you have a primitive
and involved brain,

685
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,488
something that's a little bit
on shaky ground these days.

686
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:22,370
The idea that Darwin proposed,

687
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,476
that there are these universal
expressions of emotions.

688
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:27,820
The work of Helen Fisher on love,

689
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,520
that you have circuits in the brain

690
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,320
for lost circuits in the brain,

691
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,229
for love and circuits in the
brain for long-term bonds,

692
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:36,877
as well as the work of
Lisa Feldman Barrett,

693
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:39,410
saying that emotions are contextual,

694
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,803
that they have a social component.

695
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:43,810
And I'll be talking more about this,

696
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,092
but the work of Allan Schore,

697
00:26:45,092 --> 00:26:49,430
a clinical psychologist
and researcher at UCLA,

698
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,830
about right brain, left brain,

699
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,420
and its role in emotional development.

700
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,940
All of them have strong elements

701
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,660
of this idea of paying attention

702
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,932
to what's going on inward and outward.

703
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:04,622
As a young creature, an
infant and young toddler,

704
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,620
you were mainly focused inward,

705
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,040
and you started to understand
what was going on outward

706
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,500
as a way of predicting what
would bring you relief,

707
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,200
what would remove your anxiety.

708
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,310
And that's where the fundamental
rules of your experience,

709
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,367
your emotional experience were laid down.

710
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:22,130
And I realized that's a lot of information

711
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,032
and it's somewhat of an academic talk,

712
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,686
but there were two tools in there

713
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,090
that I just want to highlight,

714
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,390
one is the Mood Meter app.

715
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,500
If you're interested in, it
can give you some insight

716
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,860
into the different kinds
of nuance within emotions

717
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,978
and allow you to actually
predict emotional states,

718
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:37,247
if you want to try that

719
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:39,090
and you might find that interesting.

720
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,470
The other one is this idea that

721
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,094
there are three axes two emotion,

722
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,369
three continuum that interact,

723
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:46,658
the level of alertness and calmness,

724
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:48,244
how good or bad you feel,

725
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,750
and whether or not you're mainly
focused inward or outward,

726
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,483
because those are going
to form a useful tool kit

727
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,790
for the information going forward.

728
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,983
So now let's talk about
what kind of baby you were,

729
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:03,145
because that actually informs
your emotionality now.

730
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:04,680
These are classic.

731
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,106
They're actually famous experiments

732
00:28:06,106 --> 00:28:08,300
done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.

733
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,630
Anyone that study psychology

734
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,900
or has taken a psychology class

735
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,121
might have learned about this.

736
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:14,907
This is this classic experiment

737
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:19,745
of what was called the strange
situation task in which,

738
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:22,920
and I'm describing it very
coarsely here, I realize.

739
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,033
But a mother and child
come into the laboratory.

740
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:29,823
Yes, this is now also
been done with fathers.

741
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:35,830
The baby and the mother or
father play together for a bit,

742
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,844
and then the mother leaves.

743
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:40,680
The mother leaves for some period of time

744
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,246
and then comes back.

745
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:45,730
And the research is devoted

746
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,750
to understanding the response of the child

747
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,650
when the caretaker,

748
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,610
the mother or the father
returns, most all children,

749
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,550
not every child, but
most children will cry

750
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,340
when their primary caretaker leaves.

751
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,060
They don't like that.

752
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,750
And there are good reasons for that.

753
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,480
They formed a bond and an attachment.

754
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,313
And we will talk about

755
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:09,849
some of the deeper chemical
reasons for those bonds.

756
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,930
However, the experiment is focused

757
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,200
on the return of the caregiver.

758
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,570
Because Bowlby and Ainsworth,

759
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,835
and many of their scientific
offspring and colleagues

760
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:25,835
identified at least four
patterns that babies display

761
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,460
when their caretaker returns,

762
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,830
and they group these
into group a, b, c, d,

763
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,730
so much so that the kids
were referred to as a babies,

764
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,860
b babies, c babies or d babies.

765
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,150
You may know which one you were.

766
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,050
But the categories are really interesting.

767
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,112
The first babies are the a babies.

768
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,320
So these were kids

769
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,254
that would get upset when
their caretaker would leave.

770
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,051
But when their caretaker would return,

771
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:55,310
the infant would respond with happiness,

772
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,670
with what looked like delight.

773
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,910
They would go to the caretaker.

774
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:58,743
They seemed happy.

775
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:02,473
If they had been fussy before
or sad, they felt relieved.

776
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,034
These are referred to
as secure attached kids.

777
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:10,130
So they have a healthy
response to separation,

778
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,134
and they have a healthy response

779
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:14,396
to re-engaging with the caretaker.

780
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,345
The b babies as they're called

781
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:21,119
were less likely to seek
comfort from their caregiver

782
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,650
when the caregiver would return.

783
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,984
So they would sometimes
continue to play with their toys

784
00:30:25,984 --> 00:30:29,740
or if they had an adult in the room

785
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,447
while the parent was gone,
they would stay with them.

786
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,245
It was sometimes complicated and nuanced,

787
00:30:34,245 --> 00:30:37,503
but these were referred
to as avoidant babies.

788
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,190
Don't run away with any conclusions

789
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,013
about the language here just yet.

790
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:45,373
It's not clear that avoidant
babies become avoidant adults,

791
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:47,500
but bear with me.

792
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,114
The c babies would respond to
the return of the caregiver

793
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:54,930
with acts of annoyance.

794
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,635
They seemed kind of angry.

795
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,640
So it wasn't that they ignored them,

796
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,340
they seem kind of angry.

797
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,900
And those were referred
to as ambivalent babies,

798
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,290
not to be confused with a babies.

799
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,878
These are the c babies,
were the ambivalent babies.

800
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:08,800
So the infant's reaction

801
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,765
to the returning caregiver
were inconsistent.

802
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:15,310
It seemed like they wanted
to bond with them again

803
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,499
but that they seem kind of annoyed.

804
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,348
I think we've all felt this way before

805
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:21,130
with people that we care very much about,

806
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,500
especially people we care very much about.

807
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,430
And then the third category, the d babies,

808
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,900
were the disorganized babies,
that's what they call them.

809
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,511
They weren't disorganized
and that they were messy,

810
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:32,771
the child avoided
interactions with everyone

811
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,686
and acted fearful when
the caregiver returned,

812
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,210
and their behavior didn't really change

813
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,070
whether or not the
caregiver was there or not.

814
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,750
And that fourth category was
actually added rather late

815
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,024
in the course of this research.

816
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:47,780
I should mention these
experiments have been repeated

817
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,823
with a huge variety of different contexts.

818
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:52,950
There was work done by Mary Main

819
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,393
at UC Berkeley and many others,

820
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:58,900
looking at all sorts of
variations on this theme.

821
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,240
But over time, it made it clear

822
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,930
that certain babies
are able to feel secure

823
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,110
upon re-engaging with their
caregiver and others don't,

824
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,030
or they're confused about it.

825
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,240
So we probably don't know

826
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,458
whether or not you were
an a, b or c, d baby,

827
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,260
unless you were in these experiments

828
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,070
and somehow you had that knowledge.

829
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,408
But this work, this classic work

830
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,772
opened up a huge set
of important questions

831
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:30,200
that relate to what is the reestablishment

832
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,580
of the bond really about.

833
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,230
I mean, what's actually
being figured out here

834
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,500
is not whether or not there
are four categories of babies,

835
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,580
that's interesting,

836
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,370
but it presumably is more interesting

837
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,150
to focus on what is it that
defines a really good bond,

838
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,730
a secure attachment, or
an insecure attachment

839
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,258
or an avoidant attachment.

840
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:54,258
And the four things are
gaze. literally eye contact,

841
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,950
and doesn't have to be
direct beaming eye contact

842
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,950
with no blinks like people
have accused me of before.

843
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,170
It can just be gaze,
people look at each other,

844
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,540
you see couples, they look at each other,

845
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,510
they don't always stare each
other long periods of time,

846
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,463
sometimes they do.

847
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,653
Vocalizations, so what
we say and how we say it.

848
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,210
Affect or emotion,

849
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,177
so the way that we express
it, crying, smiling

850
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:22,000
et cetera, and touch, those four things.

851
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,540
And you probably could
add a fifth dimension

852
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,320
once language and written
language develops,

853
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,740
which is written word,

854
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,780
exchange of letters,

855
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,670
exchange of texts,

856
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,490
exchange of things of that
sort, emails, are another way

857
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,400
in which people can bond.

858
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,355
But gaze, vocalization, affect
and touch are really the core

859
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:44,453
of this thing that we call
social bonds and emotionality.

860
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:46,180
Now that's important.

861
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,290
We know for instance

862
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,240
that there are brain areas
like the fusiform face area

863
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,334
which is deep in the brain

864
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:54,970
that is responsible for
the processing of faces.

865
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,060
Children's recognition of
their parents' faces and voices

866
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,842
is extremely accurate and strong.

867
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:05,730
Likewise, parents recognition
of their child's vocalizations

868
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,750
not just voices, but cries are remarkable.

869
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,210
If you've ever had the
experience of being at a party

870
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,510
with somebody who has small children

871
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,342
and you're talking to them,

872
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,749
and all of a sudden they
hear something but you don't,

873
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,070
it's as if they've got wolf hearing,

874
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,679
and all of a sudden, they go
running into the other room.

875
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,389
And indeed the kid is like, I don't know,

876
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,869
some kid is beating up their kid

877
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,590
or their kid's beating up some other kid,

878
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,739
or the kid injure themselves

879
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,269
or feels emotionally injured.

880
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,626
This perception of voices.

881
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:32,600
There's very good evidence

882
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,190
to support the fact that we are tuned

883
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,770
to the frequencies of voices

884
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,790
and vocalizations of
people that we care about.

885
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,927
It's not just true in rodents

886
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:41,650
and in birds and other mammals,

887
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,340
it's definitely true in humans as well.

888
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,170
And babies are very tuned in

889
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,969
to the sound of their mother's voice,

890
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,888
even, yes, while they're in the womb.

891
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:52,969
There's this whole world of
what's called mother-ease,

892
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:56,879
which is the particular
style of speech that mothers

893
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,250
and other caretakers now
we know use with children.

894
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,295
So those are the core elements.

895
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:04,390
How you look at somebody
and how they look at you,

896
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,344
what you say, what they say,
what they seem to be feeling,

897
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:11,210
and how that makes you
feel, smiles, frowns.

898
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,772
If you know someone really
well, you can read inflections,

899
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:15,970
like even little subtle things like,

900
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,460
mm, they don't really believe me,

901
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,690
or, oh they're really excited by this,

902
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,957
or, oh, now I know what they're thinking.

903
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,430
That kind of processing,

904
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,580
some people are better at it than others,

905
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,010
but everyone's better at doing that

906
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,850
with people that we recognize and know.

907
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,946
In fact, couples come to know
each other exceedingly well,

908
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:38,680
so much so that it can both benefit

909
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,440
and injure their relationship

910
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,750
to constantly be making these perceptions.

911
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,583
But there's a range.

912
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,040
Some people are more tuned
into this than others.

913
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,614
And that probably has roots

914
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:50,820
in the sorts of attachments
that you form early on.

915
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,620
So Bowlby and colleagues
develop these a, b, c, d thing.

916
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,435
And it has a lot to do
with face processing

917
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:00,580
and gaze and vocalizations and touch,

918
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,820
all of those happen on
return with the mother,

919
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,980
but they weren't parsing those,

920
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,670
they weren't looking at them individually.

921
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,113
So this raises a really
interesting question, which is,

922
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,730
what is it when we feel something?

923
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,810
Is it because of something

924
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,300
that happened spontaneously
in us, it's a memory,

925
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,530
or it's something that we
realize, we saw on the internet

926
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,670
or we got news about somebody?

927
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,280
Nowadays people get so much information

928
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,113
about the people they know,

929
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:26,970
both the people they like and dislike

930
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,540
by way of viewing online activities.

931
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,760
So they're exterocepting,

932
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,770
and then it's impacting
your internal state.

933
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,100
And it's clear

934
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,051
from most all of the
theories of emotional health,

935
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:41,124
that an ability to recognize

936
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,110
when your own internal state

937
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,298
is being driven primarily
by external events,

938
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:50,663
as important for being able
to emotionally regulate.

939
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:52,430
People who are constantly

940
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,162
being yanked around by the
external happenings in the world,

941
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:57,236
you would say are emotionally labile,

942
00:36:57,236 --> 00:37:00,186
they are not in control of their emotions,

943
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,501
even if they're calm all the time,

944
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:04,460
if that calmness only arrives

945
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,160
because they're in a placid environment

946
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,430
and then you put a cracker
in that environment

947
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,760
and they freak out, well,
then they're not really calm.

948
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,930
Their calm in so far

949
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,300
as there isn't something
disturbing in the environment.

950
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,240
So how much the outside environment

951
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,724
disrupts your internal environment

952
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:20,840
has everything to do

953
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,340
with this balance of interoception
and an exteroception.

954
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,760
And it very likely has roots

955
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,610
in whether or not you were secure attached

956
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,840
or insecure attached,

957
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,220
disorganized or ambivalent as a baby.

958
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,340
And of course, you can't
travel back in time and know,

959
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,450
but there are some hints

960
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,357
as to what kind of
emotionality each of us has

961
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,630
by examining two periods of development,

962
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,660
one is adolescence and puberty
and the other is adulthood.

963
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,479
So while we can't travel back in time,

964
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,728
there is an exercise that you can do

965
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,804
to address at least in this moment,

966
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,765
whether or not you have
a bias for exteroception

967
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:58,280
or a bias for interoception,

968
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,215
whether or not you are better
at least in this moment,

969
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:02,390
at paying attention

970
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,110
to what's going on
internally or externally.

971
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,328
And of course, this will
vary with circumstance.

972
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:10,370
I think we all know people
that, maybe it's you,

973
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,828
you go to a party and you get there,

974
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:14,720
and everyone seems to be talking

975
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,778
and having a really good time,

976
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:17,378
and you're wondering whether or not

977
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,370
you have any food in your teeth

978
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,850
or whether or not there's
something on your face

979
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,740
or whether or not your hair is right

980
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,903
or whether or not you said
something the wrong way,

981
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,410
whether or not you're turning red.

982
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,498
People also experience this
a lot with public speaking.

983
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:33,990
It's not just about learning
to clamp your level of stress,

984
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,030
it's also about how much
you're exterocepting,

985
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,240
how much you're out of
your head, they call it.

986
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,812
But how much you're focused
on the events around you

987
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:43,930
versus the events inside you.

988
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,798
Actually, it's interesting

989
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:49,201
when you talk to people who
are very effective athletes

990
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,965
or they have very high
stress high consequence jobs,

991
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:55,210
they talk about this notion
of getting out of your head.

992
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,580
You only have so much
attentional resource,

993
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,910
and it can be split between two things,

994
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,887
you'll see that in a moment.

995
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,950
They can be anchored to one thing.

996
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,763
It can be fully focused on
what's going on internally

997
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:08,260
or it can be fully focused on
what's going on externally.

998
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,550
And if you want to be
effective in the world,

999
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,836
effective being in quotes,

1000
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:16,049
it is useful when in very
dynamic environments,

1001
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,812
especially social environments,

1002
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:21,090
to have a lot of your
attention focused outward

1003
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,530
as opposed to trying to pay attention

1004
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,050
to whether or not you're
saying things correctly

1005
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,380
or the tambour of your own voice,

1006
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,780
that is more or less destructive

1007
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,030
for the ability to engage socially.

1008
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:34,688
So here's the exercise.

1009
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:35,900
You can do this.

1010
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,275
Please don't do this if you're driving.

1011
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:41,320
But let's just try and illustrate

1012
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,153
or allow you

1013
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:45,780
to experience this interoceptive,
exteroceptive balance,

1014
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,330
and the extent to which you can move

1015
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,075
interoception and
exteroception deliberately.

1016
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:54,453
If you close your eyes right now

1017
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:59,453
and concentrate on the contact
of any portion of your body

1018
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,840
with say the chair or your car seat,

1019
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,673
although please, again,

1020
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:03,701
don't do this while you're driving,

1021
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,470
anywhere that you are,

1022
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,314
even if you're just standing
up or you're in the kitchen,

1023
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:08,526
you're laying on the couch,

1024
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:11,610
and trying to bring as
much of your attention

1025
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,880
to that point of contact as possible.

1026
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,713
And then from there,

1027
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:19,100
you're going to move your
attention even more deeply

1028
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,400
into say the sensation of
what's going on in your gut.

1029
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,233
Are you full?

1030
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,066
Are you empty?

1031
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:24,899
Are you hungry?

1032
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:26,000
Are you not?

1033
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,780
Is your heart beating, at what rate?

1034
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,260
What's the cadence of your breathing?

1035
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,539
Basically bringing your
focus and attention

1036
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:34,830
to everything at the surface
of your skin and inward.

1037
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,750
So I'm going to do a rare thing
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1038
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,930
I'm going to introduce about
five to eight seconds of silence

1039
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,383
in order to allow you
to do that a little bit.

1040
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,570
Now this is an exercise

1041
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,870
that you can continue afterward

1042
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,050
if you want to extend
how long you do this.

1043
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,400
But now try and do something that,

1044
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,270
for most people actually
is a little bit harder,

1045
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,331
which is to purely exterocept,

1046
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,904
put your eyes or your ears, or both

1047
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:14,610
on anything in your
immediate space, one thing.

1048
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,045
And I would restrict that
thing to something small enough

1049
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:20,700
that at least in your field of view

1050
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,090
it would occupy 20% of your field of view.

1051
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,510
So it doesn't have to be a pinpoint

1052
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,130
unless the pin is right in front of you

1053
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,610
and you're holding it real close.

1054
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,010
I would say, look across the
room, pick a panel on the wall

1055
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:34,640
or a leg of a table or something,

1056
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,473
and try and bring

1057
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:38,483
as much of your attention
to that as possible.

1058
00:41:38,483 --> 00:41:42,260
And again, I'll take about
five seconds of silence

1059
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,210
to allow you to exterocept.

1060
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,990
So what you probably found is that

1061
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,920
you were able to do that,

1062
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,640
but that some degree of
interoception is maintained.

1063
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,930
It's hard to place 100% of your attention

1064
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,105
on something externally,

1065
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,017
unless it's really exciting, really novel.

1066
00:42:05,017 --> 00:42:06,895
If you've ever watched
a really great movie,

1067
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:09,628
presumably you're exterocepting

1068
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,660
more than you're interoceptive

1069
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,058
until something exciting happens

1070
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:14,240
and then you feel something.

1071
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,418
You're actually tethering

1072
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:18,280
your emotional experience
to something external.

1073
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,160
And now you can also do this dynamically.

1074
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,960
You can decide to focus
internally and externally.

1075
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,960
You can decide to split
it 50%, 50% or 70/30.

1076
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,845
You can develop a heightened
ability to do this.

1077
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,270
And the power of doing that

1078
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,390
is actually that when
you are in environments

1079
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,100
where you feel like you're
focused too much internally

1080
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,369
and you'd like to be
focused more externally,

1081
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,230
you can actually do that deliberately.

1082
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,220
But as you notice, it takes work,

1083
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,730
it involves taking your
attentional spotlight,

1084
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,792
and what we call the
aperture of your attention,

1085
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:57,455
and narrowing that
aperture to either the self

1086
00:42:57,455 --> 00:43:00,229
or something externally
or splitting the two.

1087
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:03,010
And yet there are practices

1088
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,890
that have been developed that center on

1089
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,262
moving interoception and exteroception

1090
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:13,470
from one being more heavily
weighted than the other,

1091
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,480
more focused outward

1092
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,040
or more focused inward.

1093
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,280
And it's dynamic.

1094
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,470
And the circuits in the brain

1095
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,767
that underlie intero and exteroception

1096
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,160
aren't exactly known,

1097
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,440
but they are anchored in
the areas of the brain

1098
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,450
that are involved in attention,

1099
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,690
like the frontal eye fields

1100
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,830
and areas that when you
third-person yourself,

1101
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,670
when you can see yourself doing something,

1102
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,520
like if you put your hand
out in your environment

1103
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,696
and you focus on your hand,

1104
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,370
you know that that's your hand

1105
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,730
as opposed to some random object.

1106
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,460
There are areas of the brain
that are involved in that,

1107
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,020
in recognizing location of self

1108
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,720
relative to the rest of your body.

1109
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:50,560
These exercises are really
what are at the core

1110
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,820
of these development of emotional bonds.

1111
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,610
Because as we mentioned
before, these four things,

1112
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,191
the gaze, vocalization, touch and affect,

1113
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:02,170
those are happening very dynamically.

1114
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,600
So if somebody winks at you,

1115
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,950
you're paying attention to their wink,

1116
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,958
but then you also notice how you feel.

1117
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,290
Then they might say something,

1118
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,300
then you might say something,
this is very dynamic.

1119
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,520
So if it seems overwhelming

1120
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,870
to try and interocept an exterocept

1121
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,030
and then shift the balance,

1122
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,170
you do that all the time.

1123
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,713
Your brain and nervous system
are fantastic at doing this.

1124
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:21,810
Now, some people have a very hard time

1125
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:25,105
breaking out of a very
strongly interoceptive mode.

1126
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:26,528
Some people have a harder time

1127
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:30,320
breaking out of their exteroceptive mode.

1128
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,802
It's very interesting note

1129
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:35,110
the extent to which we have biases

1130
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,920
in how interoceptive or
exteroceptive we are.

1131
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,266
Remember those three axes
that we talked about earlier,

1132
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:42,490
you have valence, good or bad,

1133
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,900
you have alertness, alert or calm,

1134
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,502
and you have interoceptive
or exteroceptive bias.

1135
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:51,970
And it's going to differ across the day,

1136
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,900
it's going to differ across the lifetime.

1137
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,160
It's certainly going to differ

1138
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,550
according to whatever it
is that you're engaged in.

1139
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,600
But early in development,

1140
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,951
you start off with this
interoceptive bias.

1141
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:06,010
You are starting to develop
expectations, predictions

1142
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,177
about how the outside
world is going to work.

1143
00:45:08,177 --> 00:45:12,130
And you are trying to
figure out the reliability

1144
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,768
of outside events in people.

1145
00:45:13,768 --> 00:45:16,165
And where things are reliable,

1146
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:18,773
when people are reliable,

1147
00:45:18,773 --> 00:45:22,190
we are able to give up
more of our interoception.

1148
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,890
There's literally trust
that our interoceptive needs

1149
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,610
our internal needs will be met

1150
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,931
through bonds and actions of others.

1151
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:32,035
This starts to veer toward

1152
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:34,540
the discussion about neglect and trauma.

1153
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,610
We are going to devote entire episodes,

1154
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,930
probably an entire month
to trauma and PTSD.

1155
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,830
But those have roots in what
we're talking about now.

1156
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,340
And it's important to internalize

1157
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,720
and understand what
we're talking about now

1158
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,820
in order to get the most out
of those future conversations.

1159
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,070
So if all of this seems like

1160
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,511
a lot of information and very complicated,

1161
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:57,073
I just invite you to pay
attention from time to time

1162
00:45:57,073 --> 00:46:00,323
how much you happen to be
interocepting or exterocepting,

1163
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:03,947
because emotions and the
intensity of those emotions

1164
00:46:03,947 --> 00:46:06,160
will grow or shrink

1165
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,930
depending on how much we're interocepting.

1166
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,122
If we are feeling extremely sad,

1167
00:46:10,122 --> 00:46:15,122
and there is an outside
event that made us sad,

1168
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,910
chances are there's going to be a balance,

1169
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,713
but that the extreme
grief, the extreme sadness

1170
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:23,688
is going to lead us to
mostly interoceptive.

1171
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:27,220
Whereas when we're
feeling extremely happy,

1172
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,114
the same is true.

1173
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:30,650
Something great happens in the world,

1174
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,710
and we're just going to feel it.

1175
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,080
Most of our perception,

1176
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,830
most of our awareness is going
to be on our internal state.

1177
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,520
So we are always tethered
to the outside world

1178
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,815
to some degree or another.

1179
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:42,160
That was true when you were an infant,

1180
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,110
and it was true when
you were an adolescent,

1181
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,359
and it's true as an adult.

1182
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:48,587
So now I want to just pause,

1183
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:51,030
just shelve the discussion

1184
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,270
about interoception,
exteroception for a moment.

1185
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,266
And I want to talk about

1186
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:57,688
what is arguably the second most, if not,

1187
00:46:57,688 --> 00:47:01,537
equally important aspect
of your development

1188
00:47:01,537 --> 00:47:04,153
as it relates to emotionality

1189
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:07,030
and as it relates to
this, what I call trust,

1190
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,630
but this ability to predict

1191
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,540
whether or not things in the outside world

1192
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,270
are reliable or not reliable

1193
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:14,387
in terms of their ability

1194
00:47:14,387 --> 00:47:17,150
to help you meet your interoceptive needs.

1195
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,880
And that period is puberty.

1196
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,430
So up until now, we've been
talking mainly about psychology,

1197
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,530
not a lot of biology,
not a lot of mechanism.

1198
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,980
And now we're going to transition

1199
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,500
into talking about mechanism,

1200
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,270
hormones, receptors, et cetera.

1201
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,477
Puberty is a absolute biological event.

1202
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:39,016
It has a beginning, and it
has a specific definition,

1203
00:47:39,016 --> 00:47:42,401
which is the transition
into reproductive maturity.

1204
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,220
So there are a lot of hormonal changes.

1205
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,980
Yes, there are also a
lot of brain changes.

1206
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,190
And most people don't realize it,

1207
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,450
but the brain changes occur first.

1208
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,020
The brain turns on the hormone systems

1209
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,883
that allow puberty to occur.

1210
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,470
Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays

1211
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,164
than it did in the past.

1212
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:03,650
The current numbers
that I was able to find

1213
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,960
is that in females and girls,

1214
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,610
the transition is starting around age 10,

1215
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,970
whereas in boys, it's about age 12,

1216
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:12,845
that's going to differ

1217
00:48:12,845 --> 00:48:14,900
by way of a number of different factors.

1218
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,350
Those are averages.

1219
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,620
So it depends on where
you are in the world,

1220
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,210
depends on all sorts of things.

1221
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,833
One of the primary triggers for puberty

1222
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,921
is actually body fat.

1223
00:48:24,921 --> 00:48:26,622
This is interesting.

1224
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:31,622
The peptide hormone, leptin,
some people call it a peptide,

1225
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,270
some people call it a hormone,

1226
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,920
but it meets both definitions

1227
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,510
depending on how you look
at it, is made by fat.

1228
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,810
So leptin had a lot of
popularity in the '90s,

1229
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:46,182
because it was discovered
as being produced by fat,

1230
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:48,480
and it was seen in animal studies

1231
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,350
that it could promote leanness.

1232
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,350
It actually communicates to the brain

1233
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,860
that there's enough body fat

1234
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,956
in order to allow the metabolic factors

1235
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:59,760
and processes to occur
to liberate more fat.

1236
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,100
This is why people have trouble

1237
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,740
losing that last five pounds.

1238
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,810
It's because leptin levels are very low.

1239
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,840
This was actually the basis

1240
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,040
for the whole cheat day, refeed thing,

1241
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,040
that the idea was if you
eat a lot for one day a week

1242
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,035
while dieting hard,

1243
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:15,250
that you can signal to the brain

1244
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,311
that there's enough leptin.

1245
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:18,130
I don't know if that's the reason

1246
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,330
or whether or not the cheat days

1247
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,880
just provided some psychological
relief, probably both.

1248
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,880
But in any case, leptin
is made by body fat.

1249
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,290
And when there's enough leptin,

1250
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,630
it signals the brain to trigger puberty.

1251
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,400
There was a paper
published in the mid '90s

1252
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,295
in the Journal Science, excellent journal,

1253
00:49:35,295 --> 00:49:39,912
showing that leptin could be
injected into younger females

1254
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:44,420
that would not have yet gone into puberty.

1255
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,920
And you could accelerate the
onset of puberty with leptin.

1256
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,860
So more body fat, the
earlier puberty, that's true.

1257
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,450
Leptin is also involved

1258
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,280
in various growth effects
in the body generally.

1259
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,572
And it's interesting, very obese children

1260
00:49:57,572 --> 00:50:00,820
don't necessarily undergo puberty earlier.

1261
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,190
Sometimes they do, but they
do tend to be larger boned.

1262
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,780
Their bones actually grow more quickly,

1263
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,530
and they tend to have higher bone density

1264
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,930
because leptin is also
involved in bone density.

1265
00:50:11,824 --> 00:50:14,048
The whole issue of onset of puberty

1266
00:50:14,048 --> 00:50:17,580
also has some really
interesting social effects.

1267
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,830
And I want to really highlight

1268
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,780
that most of these effects,
also called pheromone effects.

1269
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,700
Remember a hormone

1270
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,680
is a substance secreted from
one area of the body, travels,

1271
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,330
and impacts tissues and
cells elsewhere in the body.

1272
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,420
A pheromone is a chemical

1273
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,900
that's released by one member of a species

1274
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,630
that goes and acts on

1275
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,820
and impacts other members of that species

1276
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,499
or even other species.

1277
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:42,340
So for instance, rodents are very good

1278
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,750
at detecting the urine

1279
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,450
and the scent markings of large carnivores

1280
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,450
that want to eat them.

1281
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,653
So that's a pheromone interaction.

1282
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,970
Whether or not they're
pheromonal effects in humans

1283
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,200
is very debated.

1284
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,480
I did a post on this on
Instagram a little while ago

1285
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,680
about some pheromone effects
that were reported in humans.

1286
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,097
And I had a couple of
people come at me saying,

1287
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:06,630
"Look, it's never really
been shown in humans

1288
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,290
that there's a pheromonal vomer,"

1289
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,770
what's called the vomeronasal organ.

1290
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,600
There's something called Jacobson's organ.

1291
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,662
It's rudimentary.

1292
00:51:12,662 --> 00:51:16,610
Some people have it, some people
don't, very controversial.

1293
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,570
So I want to point out

1294
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,860
that human pheromone
effects are controversial.

1295
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,798
Although I think there's, in my opinion,

1296
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:24,110
there's ample evidence for them,

1297
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,662
synchronization of menstrual cycles.

1298
00:51:25,662 --> 00:51:27,709
Many people report,

1299
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,970
then people say there's some studies

1300
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,162
that show that it's not true.

1301
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:35,140
Then there've been some
data showing very impressive

1302
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,525
pheromonal effects of female partners

1303
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:43,750
being able to detect the odor
of their significant others

1304
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,820
on t-shirts that were
washed several times.

1305
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,250
So they can't consciously perceive it,

1306
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,480
but they say this one smells like them,

1307
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,030
this one smells like my partner.

1308
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:55,176
And indeed, the match
was way above chance.

1309
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:58,610
So there does seem to be
weak pheromonal effects

1310
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,540
at least in my opinion
when I look at the data,

1311
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,270
but much more needs to be done.

1312
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,270
So one of the more
interesting pheromone effects

1313
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:08,415
that impacts puberty, at
least in animal models

1314
00:52:08,415 --> 00:52:11,310
is the so-called Vandenbergh
effect, which is,

1315
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,847
if you take a pre-pubertal female,

1316
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:17,786
so a female that has not
undergone sexual maturation,

1317
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:21,410
and you introduce a novel male

1318
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,400
that is not the father or
a brother, not a sibling,

1319
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,099
she will undergo puberty
almost immediately.

1320
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:30,640
So this is really striking.

1321
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,473
For years,

1322
00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:33,550
this was thought not to
occur in primate species,

1323
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,522
but there was a paper published last year

1324
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:38,840
in Current Biology, Cell Press
journal, excellent journal,

1325
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,161
showing that mandrills, a
particular type of primate,

1326
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:45,336
they exhibit this Vandenbergh effect.

1327
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:49,940
There are also all sorts
of other pheromone effects.

1328
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,310
There's the most infamous one

1329
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,313
is called the Bruce effect,

1330
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:56,814
where the introduction of a novel male

1331
00:52:56,814 --> 00:53:01,814
to a pregnant female animal
causes spontaneous miscarriage.

1332
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:07,040
And that effect seems
to be protected against

1333
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,823
by the presence of the father.

1334
00:53:10,046 --> 00:53:12,090
This interpretation of this,

1335
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,270
and I want to really highlight

1336
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,972
that these are animal studies,

1337
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:18,970
but the way this works

1338
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,731
is that if a pregnant female

1339
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:25,662
is in the company of the
male that impregnated her,

1340
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:29,030
then her young are protected

1341
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,780
by his scent presence or
his pheromone presence.

1342
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,149
But if he's gone and
a novel male shows up,

1343
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:39,543
there's a tendency for her
to spontaneously miscarry,

1344
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:43,840
and essentially for the fetus to be lost.

1345
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,500
Now, whether or not this occurs in humans

1346
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,890
is still very controversial,
but nonetheless,

1347
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,960
these pheromone effects exist.

1348
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,360
And that one is called the Bruce effect,

1349
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,850
named after Hilda Bruce,

1350
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,761
who is the scientist that discovered it.

1351
00:53:58,761 --> 00:54:00,250
The one that's relevant

1352
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,010
to the puberty discussion
is the Vandenbergh effect,

1353
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,860
which I mentioned a few minutes ago,

1354
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,358
which is a novel male showing up,

1355
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,050
has to be a sexually competent male,

1356
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,488
so he has to have already
passed through puberty,

1357
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:17,460
and his presence triggers
activation of puberty

1358
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,180
in a female that otherwise

1359
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,710
would have remained
pre-pubertal for longer.

1360
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,615
Again, whether or not this
happens in humans is unclear.

1361
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:29,615
Well, what can we be sure about
when we think about puberty?

1362
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,050
Puberty is triggered by a
number of different factors.

1363
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,390
There are changes in GABA
expression in the brain,

1364
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,720
an inhibitory transmitter.

1365
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,954
One of the more interesting molecules

1366
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:40,939
that triggers puberty in all individuals

1367
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:43,610
is something called kisspeptin,

1368
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:48,610
K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kisspeptin.

1369
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,950
Kisspeptin is made by the brain.

1370
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,917
And it stimulates

1371
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:55,905
large amounts of all different hormone

1372
00:54:55,905 --> 00:55:00,905
called GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone to be released.

1373
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,481
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

1374
00:55:02,481 --> 00:55:04,404
then causes the release of another hormone

1375
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:07,818
called luteinizing hormone or LH,

1376
00:55:07,818 --> 00:55:09,719
which travels in the bloodstream

1377
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:13,406
and stimulates the ovaries of
females to produce estrogen

1378
00:55:13,406 --> 00:55:17,683
and the testes of males
to produce testosterone.

1379
00:55:17,683 --> 00:55:20,523
Kisspeptin has other effects as well.

1380
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,780
But those are some of the main ones

1381
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,790
as they relate to puberty.

1382
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,670
This is interesting,
because at this point,

1383
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,320
the testes in males

1384
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
start churning out tons of testosterone

1385
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,680
in order to trigger

1386
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,700
the development of secondary
sexual characteristics,

1387
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,410
body hair and all the others,
deepening of voice, et cetera.

1388
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,250
And in females, estrogen is
doing various other things,

1389
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,557
breast development, et cetera.

1390
00:55:45,557 --> 00:55:48,379
Normally, in an adult,

1391
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:50,709
somebody who has passed puberty,

1392
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:53,960
a big increase in
gonadotropin releasing hormone

1393
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,910
and luteinizing hormone would
eventually be shut down,

1394
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,180
because the way that the brain works,

1395
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,030
the hypothalamus and the pituitary

1396
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,710
are actually measuring how
much hormone is in the blood.

1397
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,540
And if testosterone or estrogen

1398
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,580
or any other hormone goes too high,

1399
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,468
they shut down

1400
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:10,930
the release of things
like luteinizing hormone.

1401
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,150
It's called a negative feedback loop.

1402
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,100
Basically is like a
thermostat in the house.

1403
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,210
It's more complicated than that,

1404
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,410
but once levels get too
high in the blood stream,

1405
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,430
it shuts down.

1406
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,160
But kisspeptin is able to drive

1407
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,620
very high levels of these
hormones in an ongoing way

1408
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,350
so that puberty can
commence and can continue.

1409
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,046
And incidentally,
kisspeptin has now become

1410
00:56:31,046 --> 00:56:36,046
yet another of the panoply of hormones

1411
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,290
and peptides and cocktails
that athletes take

1412
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:42,199
in order to try and stimulate
natural hormone production,

1413
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:44,040
essentially to create their own

1414
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,773
performance-enhancing drugs endogenously.

1415
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:48,930
No judgment there, but that's a fact,

1416
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,210
there's a lot of kisspeptin used.

1417
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,550
I truly not suggesting anyone do this,

1418
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,800
but people are buying
and injecting kisspeptin

1419
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,220
for the specific reason
that even past puberty

1420
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:04,740
can stimulate the large increases
in things like estrogen,

1421
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,850
large increases in testosterone
and things of that sort.

1422
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,789
Has a number of psychological effects too,

1423
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:12,942
seems to have big effects
on libido, et cetera.

1424
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:15,730
All these things of course
are subject to feedback loops,

1425
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,060
so they don't work indefinitely.

1426
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,893
And I'm going to highlight,

1427
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,300
again, I'm not suggesting anyone do it,

1428
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,040
but I do like to pay
attention to what's out there.

1429
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,832
And kisspeptin, because it
wasn't discovered that long ago

1430
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:28,048
is one of the things that
you don't often hear about

1431
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:31,810
when people talk about
performance-enhancing drugs

1432
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,990
or therapeutic endocrinology.

1433
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,861
These things also have therapeutic uses

1434
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:39,300
in the endocrine setting.

1435
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,380
So for instance, kids
that don't undergo puberty

1436
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,330
or kids that are hypogonadal
or adults that are hypogonadal,

1437
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,690
they're not making enough hormone

1438
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,780
will take things like
kisspeptin among other things.

1439
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,040
So that's how puberty happens
at the biological level,

1440
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,584
gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin.

1441
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:57,272
And then this young child

1442
00:57:57,272 --> 00:58:02,270
is now a different
creature to to some extent,

1443
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,521
not just because

1444
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,620
they're reproductively
competent, of course,

1445
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,670
but because there's a shift

1446
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:11,573
in a number of the things that
underlie these social bonds,

1447
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:14,220
there's a market shift

1448
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,480
in a number of the things

1449
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,030
that allow children and adults

1450
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:22,300
to engage in predictive
behavior about each other.

1451
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,648
And the whole nature of
adolescence and puberty

1452
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:30,034
is to take a child that was a generalist

1453
00:58:30,034 --> 00:58:31,920
and to make them a specialist.

1454
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,096
And this is very important

1455
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:35,830
as it relates to the
conversation about emotionality.

1456
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,800
But it's important in terms
of aspects of brain function

1457
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,870
and in terms of learning

1458
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,440
and in terms of who
each and every one of us

1459
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,963
will and has become.

1460
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:49,800
In adolescents and in childhood,

1461
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,769
sure, there are some genetic biases,

1462
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:54,790
hair color, eye color,
height, and things like that.

1463
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,940
A lot of that's programmed
into the genome.

1464
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,167
There are other genetic
biases too of course,

1465
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,727
that we inherit.

1466
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:06,650
But it's in adolescents in puberty

1467
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,520
that we go from essentially

1468
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,857
being somewhat good at a bunch of things

1469
00:59:10,857 --> 00:59:13,650
or somewhat poor at a bunch of things,

1470
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,057
to be coming very good at a few things

1471
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:18,055
and very poor at a lot of other things.

1472
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,370
And that's because

1473
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:22,006
of the relationship to
puberty and neuroplasticity,

1474
00:59:22,006 --> 00:59:25,160
this ability to change the
brain in response to experience

1475
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,631
is starting to taper off
such that by our early 20s,

1476
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,819
it's harder to achieve.

1477
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:34,400
Now, the transition from
generalist to specialist

1478
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,820
is one aspect of adolescence and puberty,

1479
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,230
but the other is the formation

1480
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:40,800
of social and emotional bonds.

1481
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,220
And most of what consumes the minds

1482
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,140
and waking hours of adolescents

1483
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,760
and children who have gone through puberty

1484
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,110
and going through puberty

1485
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:54,362
is questions about how they
relate to social structures,

1486
00:59:54,362 --> 00:59:56,089
who they can rely on,

1487
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:59,050
and how they can make reliable
predictions in the world,

1488
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,640
now that they have more urgency

1489
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,945
that they are physically changed.

1490
01:00:02,945 --> 01:00:04,500
In fact, you could argue

1491
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,240
that puberty is the
fastest rate of maturation

1492
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,400
that you'll go through at
any point in your life.

1493
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,300
It's the largest change
that you'll go through

1494
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,073
at any point in your life
in terms of who you are,

1495
01:00:14,073 --> 01:00:16,720
because your biology has
fundamentally changed

1496
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,190
at the level of your brain
and your bodily organs,

1497
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,686
all your organs from the skin inward.

1498
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:26,223
So I want to visit a
little bit of the research

1499
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:30,060
about some of the core needs that occurred

1500
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,748
during puberty and adolescence,

1501
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:33,220
not just for parents

1502
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,290
or for the people that might
be in puberty and adolescence,

1503
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,470
but also so that people can reflect

1504
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,840
on which of the sort of boxes
were checked off for them

1505
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,363
as they approached emotional maturity.

1506
01:00:46,363 --> 01:00:49,070
So there's a terrific review article

1507
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,360
that was published in the
journal Nature, which is,

1508
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,540
if not the premier,

1509
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,101
then certainly among the
top three premier journals

1510
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:57,960
in the field of science

1511
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,660
about the biology of
adolescence and puberty,

1512
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:06,570
as well as some of the
core needs and demands

1513
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,770
that have to be met

1514
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:11,040
for successful emotional
maturation during that time.

1515
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,651
We will provide a link to that,

1516
01:01:12,651 --> 01:01:14,930
but I just want to highlight

1517
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:18,230
a few of the things that they
place in the final table.

1518
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,777
I don't want to go through
all the results right now,

1519
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:22,113
because you could do that
on your own if you like.

1520
01:01:22,113 --> 01:01:23,263
They mainly highlight

1521
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:27,127
a lot of the changes in
neurons and neural circuits.

1522
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:29,150
For instance, I'll just highlight one,

1523
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,414
there's a connection

1524
01:01:30,414 --> 01:01:32,790
between the dopamine centers in the brain

1525
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,010
and an area of the brain

1526
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,680
that's involved in emotion and dispersal.

1527
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,290
Dispersal is very interesting.

1528
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,800
What you observe in animals and humans

1529
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,450
is that around the end of adolescence

1530
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,927
and during the transition to puberty,

1531
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:51,291
both because of changes in the
brain and changes in hormones

1532
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:56,291
there's an intense desire
on the part of the child

1533
01:01:56,327 --> 01:02:01,327
to get further and further
away from primary caregivers,

1534
01:02:01,653 --> 01:02:04,090
not permanently, they always return,

1535
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,960
similar to a child that walks off

1536
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,920
and then looks back and
sees if everything's safe

1537
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,203
and then continues on.

1538
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:11,366
During adolescence and puberty,

1539
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:13,942
both in animals and in kids,

1540
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,800
it almost seems like
there's a bias for action,

1541
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,633
and the action

1542
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,170
is always in a direction away
from the primary caregiver.

1543
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,160
Now, as soon as I say that,
I can just imagine in my mind

1544
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,127
that somebody out there saying,

1545
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:27,500
"Well, no, my kid as
soon as they hit puberty,

1546
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,680
they just want to stay
home with us all the time."

1547
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,860
That's not typical.

1548
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,570
It happens, but it's not typical.

1549
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,690
Mostly there's a desire

1550
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,740
to start spending more time with friends,

1551
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,130
more time with peers and
less time with adults.

1552
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,920
And I find it extremely interesting

1553
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,780
to note that that's not
just true in humans,

1554
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,000
that's true in other primate species.

1555
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,360
That's true in rodents.

1556
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,729
That's true in almost every
other mammalian species.

1557
01:02:49,729 --> 01:02:52,330
So there's something about these hormones

1558
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:55,063
that don't just allow sexual reproduction.

1559
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:56,810
They don't just change the brain

1560
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,292
and bodily organs and the shape of us,

1561
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:03,110
they also bias us towards dispersal,

1562
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,430
getting further and further away

1563
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,290
from primary caregivers in particular.

1564
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,010
So parents of teenagers
or future teenagers,

1565
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,860
it is not just normal,

1566
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,270
it is baked in to the biology of humans

1567
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:18,190
to disperse around adolescents
and in the teen years.

1568
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,740
So again, I just want to
highlight a few of these,

1569
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:21,763
what were listed

1570
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:24,043
as intervention strategies

1571
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:27,553
to promote healthy
adolescence and puberty.

1572
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,955
It's very interesting
because the entire article,

1573
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:34,743
I should mention who wrote
this article, apologies.

1574
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,530
One of them is a friend of mine.

1575
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,450
So the first author is Ronald Dahl,

1576
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,053
not the children's book
author, I'm assuming,

1577
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,840
no, from the School of Public Health

1578
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,515
at University of California, Berkeley

1579
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:51,520
and Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbert

1580
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,560
and Anna Balanoff Suliman,

1581
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,200
forgive me for the
pronunciation of the last one.

1582
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,880
I know Dr. Wilbert quite well.

1583
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,350
She's done the work on dispersal,

1584
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,458
is quite well known for that work,

1585
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:06,807
and it's a very extensive review,

1586
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:10,080
but I think you'll find it accessible.

1587
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,890
A lot of changes and
thickness of the brain

1588
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,240
at different stages, et cetera.

1589
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,840
But I think most people will be interested

1590
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,680
in what that translates
to in the real world.

1591
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,564
And what's interesting is during puberty,

1592
01:04:23,564 --> 01:04:26,500
there's increased connection,

1593
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,390
connectivity as we call it
between the prefrontal cortex,

1594
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,732
which is involved in
motivation and decision-making,

1595
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,726
being able to suppress action

1596
01:04:33,726 --> 01:04:37,430
for making long-term goals possible,

1597
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,200
as well as dopamine
centers and the amygdala.

1598
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,610
So there's this really broad
integration and testing.

1599
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,230
I think this is the key element here,

1600
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,440
testing of circuits
for emotions and reward

1601
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,600
as they relate to decisions.

1602
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,007
And I think that's useful because

1603
01:04:53,007 --> 01:04:55,730
when you look at the behavior
of adolescents and teens,

1604
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,530
they are testing social interactions,

1605
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:00,136
they are testing physical
interactions with the world.

1606
01:05:00,136 --> 01:05:02,943
Oftentimes they're engaging
in unsafe behavior.

1607
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:07,493
I would never try and justify that

1608
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:09,372
with the underlying neurology,

1609
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:13,570
but the neuroscience points
to increased connectivity

1610
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:16,900
between areas of the brain that
are related to emotionality

1611
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,470
and to threat detection like
the amygdala, but also reward.

1612
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:23,314
So it's a time of testing behaviorally

1613
01:05:23,314 --> 01:05:26,842
how different behaviors
lead to success or not.

1614
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:31,230
It's how different behaviors
lead to fear states or not.

1615
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,063
Now, of course you could say that

1616
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:33,270
of any stage of development,

1617
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:36,730
but it seems like puberty is
a very, very heightened stage

1618
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,040
in which testing of contingencies,

1619
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,280
good or bad is taking place.

1620
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,190
And of course it's operating in a body

1621
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,820
that's now more capable than the infant.

1622
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,150
So an infant can damage
themselves through error,

1623
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,730
but it's harder for them
to damage themselves

1624
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:53,957
through deliberate planning.

1625
01:05:53,957 --> 01:05:55,780
That's why it's important of course,

1626
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,790
to lock up all the
medications in the house,

1627
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,329
make sure infants can't get to them,

1628
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:02,700
but it's not likely that the infant

1629
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,710
is going to devise an
extremely diabolical plan

1630
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,737
to get into the cabinet to
get a certain substance.

1631
01:06:08,737 --> 01:06:10,763
Whereas a teenager might.

1632
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,470
So you can start to map the neurology

1633
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,010
onto some of this emotional exploration.

1634
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,260
I do realize that this
episode is about emotions.

1635
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,529
Puberty is a time in which

1636
01:06:20,529 --> 01:06:25,010
the internal state of
the person or the animal

1637
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:27,267
is being sampled and tested against

1638
01:06:27,267 --> 01:06:29,240
different exteroceptive events,

1639
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,960
only now they are able

1640
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,570
to guide those events with more urgency.

1641
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,950
It's no longer just about
whether or not the caregiver

1642
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:39,330
is bringing you milk or bringing you food.

1643
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,787
Now, of course, the parents will all say,

1644
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:42,550
"Yeah, but I'm paying for
everything that they're doing.

1645
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,600
I'm paying for the car and
I'm paying for the food."

1646
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,613
Ah, true.

1647
01:06:45,613 --> 01:06:49,050
But the biology doesn't
care about the source,

1648
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,410
the child or the adolescent is now able,

1649
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,390
the teen really, is able to now sample

1650
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,480
many, many more exteroceptive
events through behavior.

1651
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,840
So some of these
recommendations are interesting.

1652
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,920
The theory is that one of the motivations

1653
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,038
is to learn to mitigate the
risk of famine and malnutrition.

1654
01:07:08,038 --> 01:07:10,970
As teenagers get older,
they start questioning

1655
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:11,836
whether or not their parents

1656
01:07:11,836 --> 01:07:14,320
are everything they thought they were,

1657
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,535
whether or not they're the
greatest thing that ever was

1658
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:19,160
or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps.

1659
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,330
Including whether or not

1660
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,360
they will be able to
provide them resources.

1661
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,450
So they test whether or not

1662
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,140
they can actually feed themselves,

1663
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,327
whether or not they
can support themselves.

1664
01:07:28,327 --> 01:07:30,864
Although rarely not,

1665
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:32,530
certainly it happens,

1666
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:35,390
but rarely are they really
taking care of themselves.

1667
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,560
Although some teens are forced
to take care of themselves

1668
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,967
of course, because parents

1669
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,638
and other caretakers aren't available.

1670
01:07:40,638 --> 01:07:45,330
The recommendations that
map to the biology include,

1671
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,200
there's been a big push for
later start times in schools

1672
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,730
to match their shifts in circadian rhythms

1673
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,020
and the need for extended sleep.

1674
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,593
Something we talked about
during the sleep episodes.

1675
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:59,418
To insist on sleep interventions for youth

1676
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:02,940
who are at increased risk
for mental health problems.

1677
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,210
Almost every mental
health issue is supported

1678
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:10,440
by getting regular quality
sleep of sufficient duration.

1679
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,732
Sufficient duration is going
to vary from person to person.

1680
01:08:12,732 --> 01:08:16,529
Leveraging different kinds
of social relationships

1681
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:18,429
that reinforce positive behavior.

1682
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,033
This is starting to sound like
kind of a boiler plate stuff.

1683
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:24,489
And yet, really the goal is during puberty

1684
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:28,240
to encourage as many
safe forms of interaction

1685
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,895
that allow children, teens,
really and adolescents,

1686
01:08:31,895 --> 01:08:33,209
I keep calling them children,

1687
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,848
but what I mean are children
going through puberty,

1688
01:08:35,848 --> 01:08:38,969
that allow them to test
this thing of autonomy

1689
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:43,460
so that they can start
to make good assessments

1690
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:47,800
about their exteroceptive
events that they are selecting

1691
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,479
and how those make them feel internally.

1692
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:51,329
So they're essentially doing a buffet.

1693
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,711
The buffet has now broadened

1694
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:56,020
to not just include the
events and experiences

1695
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,569
that their parents and
other caretakers bring them,

1696
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:00,549
but they can now expand the buffet

1697
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,109
into things that they
can provide themselves.

1698
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:05,459
And so adolescence and puberty

1699
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,912
is really seen as the
period of development

1700
01:09:07,912 --> 01:09:11,550
in which one self-samples
for these two elements

1701
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:13,477
that we talked about at
the beginning, which are,

1702
01:09:13,477 --> 01:09:17,870
how do I form bonds and
how do I make predictions

1703
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,569
about what will make me feel good

1704
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:22,094
at a level of interoception.

1705
01:09:22,094 --> 01:09:24,640
Some of that might sound
a little transactional,

1706
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,609
that all we're trying to do

1707
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,439
is figure out how we can bond with people

1708
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,045
so we can get what we need
so we can feel how we need.

1709
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:34,340
I think that's true to some extent,

1710
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,880
of course, there's a richer,

1711
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,880
more abstract aspect to
relationships too, which are,

1712
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,949
in relationships you can access

1713
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:45,069
things you couldn't do
before, you can cooperate.

1714
01:09:45,069 --> 01:09:46,319
There's things like teamwork.

1715
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,417
You can do all sorts of things.

1716
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:49,409
But in terms of the biology,

1717
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,792
it's clear that there's
this stage of development

1718
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:54,006
where more autonomy,

1719
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:56,280
more physical capability

1720
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,368
is triggered by these
hormone changes in the brain,

1721
01:09:58,368 --> 01:10:01,360
and these peptide changes
in the brain and body.

1722
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,630
And that nonetheless

1723
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:05,742
brings us back to the exact same model

1724
01:10:05,742 --> 01:10:07,820
that we started with in infancy,

1725
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:12,552
of alert or calm, feel good or feel bad,

1726
01:10:12,552 --> 01:10:17,010
primarily exterocepting,
primarily interocepting.

1727
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,410
So I keep going back to this,

1728
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,530
I'm sort of like a
repeating record on that,

1729
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,950
because the same core algorithm,

1730
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:26,790
the same core function is at
play throughout the lifespan.

1731
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,009
And that's a useful
framework in my opinion,

1732
01:10:29,009 --> 01:10:32,500
because it allows you to
sort through all the data

1733
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,810
and information that's out there about,

1734
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,060
well, this area, the
astria terminalis is active

1735
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,750
or the basal lateral amygdala is active

1736
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,250
or gray matter thickening

1737
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,620
or this hormone or that hormone,

1738
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,033
and return to a kind of kernel

1739
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:45,840
of certainly not exhaustive truth,

1740
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,180
it doesn't cover all
aspects of emotionality,

1741
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,210
but at least establishes some groundwork

1742
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,900
from which you can start to evaluate

1743
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,159
how different behaviors might
or might not make sense,

1744
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,610
how certain emotional responses

1745
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:00,030
might or might not make sense,

1746
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:03,670
regardless of the age of
the person or the organism.

1747
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:06,800
A discussion about emotions
would not be complete

1748
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,706
without talking about the
right brain, left brain stuff.

1749
01:11:11,706 --> 01:11:16,706
And this is a very interesting
aspect of sociology,

1750
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,505
psychology and neuroscience.

1751
01:11:19,505 --> 01:11:22,260
There's a theory of emotional development

1752
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,880
that I find particularly interesting,

1753
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,970
which is from Allan Schore at UCLA,

1754
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:27,803
that talks about

1755
01:11:27,803 --> 01:11:30,652
how most of our testing
of bonds and relationships

1756
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:35,100
is this seesawing back and
forth between very dopaminergic,

1757
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:36,360
so driven by dopamine

1758
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,640
or serotonergic, driven
by serotonin states.

1759
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,800
And this starts with infant and
mother or infant and father.

1760
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,260
I talked a little bit about
this in the previous episode,

1761
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,178
but just to remind you,

1762
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,250
or for anyone that didn't hear about it,

1763
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,070
that during development,

1764
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,340
healthy emotional development

1765
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:56,340
clearly begins with an ability
for the caretaker and child

1766
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,310
to be in calm, peaceful,
soothing, touch-oriented,

1767
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,820
eye gazing type of behaviors.

1768
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:06,973
Those really drive serotonin,
the endogenous opioid system,

1769
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,940
oxytocin, things are very calming

1770
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:14,060
and are centered around
pleasure with the here and now,

1771
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:17,110
as well as excited states of
what we're going to do next.

1772
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,630
There's actually a characteristic sign

1773
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:21,812
of the dopaminergic interaction,

1774
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:26,440
where both caretaker
and child are wide-eyed,

1775
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,370
the pupils dilate.

1776
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:28,900
That's a signature of arousal.

1777
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:29,860
They get really excited.

1778
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:32,385
Oftentimes the baby will look
away if it gets really excited

1779
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:35,184
those are signatures of
dopamine release in the body,

1780
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,526
and in adolescents, these
same things carry forward,

1781
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:40,310
where their good bonds

1782
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:44,583
are achieved through
hanging around, watching TV,

1783
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,540
playing video games

1784
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,500
or texting together or talking,

1785
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,333
whatever it is

1786
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:53,450
that the soothing local
activity happens to be,

1787
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:56,100
as well as adventure and
things that are exciting,

1788
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,860
so it could be sports,
it could be shopping,

1789
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:59,880
it could be a summer adventure.

1790
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,770
It could be the next big thing.

1791
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:03,610
And so this kind of
seesawing back and forth

1792
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:08,410
between the different reward
systems seems to be the basis

1793
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,830
from which healthy
emotional bonds are created.

1794
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,500
And I invite anyone
who's interested in this

1795
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,133
to look up some of Dr. Schore's work.

1796
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,700
I think I misspoke on the last episode.

1797
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,630
He's not a psychiatrist,

1798
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:22,260
he's a clinical psychologist
and psychoanalyst,

1799
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,320
but has deep routings in neuroscience.

1800
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,814
So I think a fascinating aspect.

1801
01:13:26,814 --> 01:13:29,970
But the way it's framed in his book

1802
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:32,110
and in some of the language

1803
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:34,440
around right brain, left brain.

1804
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,930
And we've all heard this stuff before,

1805
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,280
that the right brain is thought
to be the emotional side.

1806
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,413
This is the characteristic
thing that you hear out there.

1807
01:13:41,413 --> 01:13:43,770
That the right brain is holistic,

1808
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,080
that it's emotive,

1809
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,200
and that the left brain is
logical, sequential and analytic.

1810
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,713
And that's not what Schore was proposing.

1811
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:54,800
There are some right brain,
left brain differences.

1812
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,500
But the idea that the right brain

1813
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,361
is synthetic, holistic and emotive,

1814
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:00,560
and that the left brain

1815
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,460
is logical, sequential
and analytic is false.

1816
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,253
There is zero neuroscience
evidence for that whatsoever.

1817
01:14:08,253 --> 01:14:11,510
We're going to address this in more detail

1818
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:12,990
during a month talking about learning

1819
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,750
and memory and dementia,

1820
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,930
but let's talk about some truths,

1821
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,040
some differences between the
left brain and right brain,

1822
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,780
because we can't have a
discussion about emotion

1823
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,730
without doing that.

1824
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:27,340
The left brain, at least for
people who are right-handed

1825
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,130
is linguistically dominant.

1826
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:31,200
Meaning, most of language

1827
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,428
is centered in the left side of the brain

1828
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:36,189
for right-handed people.

1829
01:14:36,189 --> 01:14:38,180
If you are a left-hander

1830
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,280
and you were forced to
become right-handed,

1831
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,940
chances are this is still true,

1832
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,330
because of when language
gets laid down in the brain.

1833
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:48,915
For left-handers,

1834
01:14:48,915 --> 01:14:51,880
people that naturally
write with their left hand

1835
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,125
and always did,

1836
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:56,728
language is still mostly in
the left side of the brain,

1837
01:14:56,728 --> 01:15:00,802
but it's also found more often

1838
01:15:00,802 --> 01:15:02,520
in the right side of the brain.

1839
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,810
So it's not as lateralized as we say,

1840
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:06,840
it's kind of distributed between both.

1841
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,825
So right-handers,

1842
01:15:07,825 --> 01:15:08,900
most of your language

1843
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,238
is coming from the left
side of your brain.

1844
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:12,170
Left-handers, it's probably

1845
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:13,940
a little bit more evenly distributed.

1846
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,120
And there are some variations,

1847
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,780
whether or not you're a
hook righty or a hook lefty,

1848
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,280
there's all sorts of nuance to this,

1849
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,050
but that's the general aspect.

1850
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,412
So language tends to be centered

1851
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:25,020
in the left side of the brain.

1852
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,850
And that includes
lexicon, grammar, syntax,

1853
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,810
all of it, except for one.

1854
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:31,540
And we'll talk about
one aspect of language

1855
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,940
that seems to be more right brain.

1856
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,960
That's very interesting.

1857
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,437
There does seem to be
some arithmetic advantage.

1858
01:15:39,437 --> 01:15:43,710
So ability in math in the
left side of the brain.

1859
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,543
And I'm going to talk about

1860
01:15:44,543 --> 01:15:46,139
how all this was discovered in a minute.

1861
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:51,050
And the right brain, however,
is linguistically primitive.

1862
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,090
Most people don't realize this

1863
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,690
because the right brain
is always described

1864
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:54,790
as the emotive side,

1865
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:56,840
it's super emotional and holistic,

1866
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,170
but it's actually
linguistically primitive.

1867
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,003
And there's a way

1868
01:16:00,003 --> 01:16:02,764
that that's been teased
out through experiment.

1869
01:16:02,764 --> 01:16:06,680
It's very good at
manipulating spatial things

1870
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,000
and visual spatial tasks.

1871
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,960
It's primarily handling that stuff,

1872
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,562
but it sort of non-language
except one aspect.

1873
01:16:14,562 --> 01:16:16,650
And there isn't a ton
of evidence for this,

1874
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,187
but the evidence is
strong, which is prosody.

1875
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:23,943
Prosody is the LILting
and falling of language.

1876
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,990
So a good example would be Italian.

1877
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:27,900
I don't speak Italian.

1878
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,284
I only know a little bit of Italian,

1879
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,300
but the most of the Italian I know

1880
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,276
is when my Italian
colleagues have said to me,

1881
01:16:34,276 --> 01:16:35,160
[speaks in foreign language],

1882
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,411
which means like what
are you trying to say,

1883
01:16:36,411 --> 01:16:37,360
what are you saying?

1884
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,130
I think I'm getting that right.

1885
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,590
Basically they're saying
I don't speak Italian,

1886
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,600
which is true.

1887
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,510
Or because one of them knows
I loves Costello very much,

1888
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:47,510
they always say [speaks
in foreign language],

1889
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:49,250
which means big, lazy guy,

1890
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,560
which accurately captures Costello.

1891
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,906
So even those few examples,

1892
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:57,516
[speaks in foreign language],

1893
01:16:57,516 --> 01:17:00,010
there's a lot of LILt and fall in Italian,

1894
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:00,997
other languages, not so much.

1895
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:02,570
And it varies by language.

1896
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:04,640
One of the reasons I find
Italian so beautiful,

1897
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,700
not the Italian I speak,

1898
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,318
but the Italian that other people speak

1899
01:17:07,318 --> 01:17:08,990
so beautiful to listen to

1900
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:10,240
that that prosody

1901
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,020
and the shifts in intonation
are really quite remarkable.

1902
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,950
It's almost like a singing song

1903
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:17,360
listening to them speak.

1904
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,070
And I used to like to go
to scientific meetings.

1905
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,750
And I always hang out with the Italians,

1906
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,720
'cause I had some good
friends in Italian labs,

1907
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,470
but also 'cause they always
knew where the best food was,

1908
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,670
their standards for food are incredible.

1909
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,320
They would rather starve
than eat terrible pasta,

1910
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,352
and the pasta they do find

1911
01:17:30,352 --> 01:17:33,120
and that they're willing
to eat is always fantastic.

1912
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,470
But in addition to that,
they always brought a guitar.

1913
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,400
They were a lot more fun

1914
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,950
than a lot of my other colleagues

1915
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,330
to hang out with at meetings.

1916
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,430
So in any event,

1917
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,984
the right brain is doing things

1918
01:17:41,984 --> 01:17:45,260
that are more about manipulating
spatial information.

1919
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,181
And I'll talk about this
more in a future episode.

1920
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:50,820
This was discovered in
split-brain patients,

1921
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,090
the people that lack connection

1922
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:53,467
between the two sides of the brain,

1923
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:55,540
this had to be teased out

1924
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,900
through very complicated experiments.

1925
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,400
People like Roger Sperry who
won a Nobel Prize for this,

1926
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,396
who was at Caltech,

1927
01:18:00,396 --> 01:18:02,350
Mike Gazzaniga and others

1928
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:05,820
figured out these lateralized differences.

1929
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:09,269
but let's just try and demolish the myth

1930
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:13,670
that the right side is synthetic
and holistic and emotive,

1931
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,950
and that the left side is
logical, sequential, and analytic,

1932
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:18,370
that you're a left brain
person or a right brain person.

1933
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:19,810
Nothing could be further from the truth.

1934
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:21,910
There's no scientific
evidence to support that.

1935
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,130
And there's a few lesion studies

1936
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,320
that can tease out effects

1937
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,276
that make you think
that's what's happening,

1938
01:18:27,276 --> 01:18:29,150
but the really careful work

1939
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,220
points in a totally different direction.

1940
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,695
We can't have a complete conversation

1941
01:18:32,695 --> 01:18:36,710
about emotions and bonds
and social connection

1942
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:38,740
without talking about oxytocin.

1943
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,750
Oxytocin has come to such prominence

1944
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,870
in the last decade or so,
and seems to be everywhere.

1945
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,873
Anytime you hear a discussion

1946
01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:49,274
about neuroscience in the
brain or hormones in the brain,

1947
01:18:49,274 --> 01:18:54,274
oxytocin is released in response
to lactation in females,

1948
01:18:55,286 --> 01:19:00,286
it is released in response
to sexual interactions.

1949
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:04,484
It is released in response
to non-sexual touch.

1950
01:19:04,484 --> 01:19:07,871
It's released in males and females,

1951
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:11,119
and indeed it's involved in pair bonding

1952
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:14,513
and the establishment of
social bonds in general.

1953
01:19:16,015 --> 01:19:21,015
How it does that seems to be
by matching internal state.

1954
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:23,278
It seems to both increase

1955
01:19:23,278 --> 01:19:26,413
synchrony of internal state somehow,

1956
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:29,490
maybe it sets a level of
calmness or alertness.

1957
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,391
That seems like a reasonable hypothesis,

1958
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:34,656
as well as raising people's awareness

1959
01:19:34,656 --> 01:19:38,965
for the emotional state of their partner.

1960
01:19:38,965 --> 01:19:40,660
And again, this brings us

1961
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:43,481
back to this alertness calmness axis

1962
01:19:43,481 --> 01:19:46,673
and this interoceptive,
exteroceptive axis.

1963
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:49,140
In order to form good bonds,

1964
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:52,280
we can't just be thinking
about how we feel,

1965
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,920
we also need to be paying
attention to how others feel,

1966
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,300
and we're evaluating a match.

1967
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,740
We're trying to see whether or not

1968
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:02,500
there seems to be some sort
of synchrony between states.

1969
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,919
And oxytocin, both seems
to increase that synchrony

1970
01:20:05,919 --> 01:20:10,423
and increase awareness for
the emotional state of others.

1971
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,333
Now I know many of you

1972
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:15,570
are probably screaming mirror
neurons, mirror neurons.

1973
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:17,367
Mirror, neurons, as some of you may know,

1974
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:19,220
and some of you perhaps may not,

1975
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:22,267
are neurons that were
discovered in animals and humans

1976
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:25,380
for their ability to respond

1977
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,830
when people engage in
certain physical actions

1978
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,240
like lifting of a pen,

1979
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,216
but the same neurons would respond

1980
01:20:33,216 --> 01:20:37,140
when somebody watched
someone else lift a pen.

1981
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,780
So they were really mirrors of,

1982
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,479
were representing mirrors of behavior,

1983
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:44,893
both in self and in others.

1984
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:49,040
Mirror neurons are very controversial.

1985
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,210
There are many neuroscientists
who I respect a lot,

1986
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,105
who don't think they exist,

1987
01:20:53,105 --> 01:20:55,850
because they look at the data,

1988
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,780
and the data, at least in their mind

1989
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,019
were over interpreted
in the realm of empathy

1990
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:04,956
and in assigning value to the
emotional states of others.

1991
01:21:04,956 --> 01:21:06,604
And when I look at the literature,

1992
01:21:06,604 --> 01:21:11,604
my opinion is that indeed
there are neurons in the brain

1993
01:21:12,094 --> 01:21:14,921
that clearly represent
the actions of others,

1994
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:16,180
but it's not clear

1995
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,510
that they're wired into the
emotion and empathy system

1996
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,900
in any direct way.

1997
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,670
And I think the growing
consensus is that mirror neurons,

1998
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,370
while the name is terrific
and it's so catchy,

1999
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,330
and encompasses so much

2000
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,950
of what you would love
for it to encompass,

2001
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,120
but that the data don't
really support that.

2002
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,050
But this is controversial,
and I'm perfectly happy

2003
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,960
to get experts on here

2004
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,990
that could debate it better than I could.

2005
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:41,170
There are however neurons in the brain

2006
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,630
that were discovered by my colleague,

2007
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:46,373
Keren Haroush at Stanford

2008
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:48,633
when she was working in Noam Ziv's Lab,

2009
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:54,991
that clearly point to the
fact that primate species

2010
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,670
are making assumptions

2011
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,810
and are trying to predict the behavior

2012
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:03,900
of other members of their species.

2013
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,733
It's an experiment,

2014
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,180
I don't have time to
go into in real detail,

2015
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:08,000
we should probably just get Keren on here.

2016
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,833
For those of you

2017
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:10,280
that are familiar with
the prisoner's dilemma,

2018
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,160
which is really a model of cooperation,

2019
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,119
you can either cooperate

2020
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:18,832
or one member of a given
interaction can cooperate

2021
01:22:18,832 --> 01:22:20,100
and the other one won't,

2022
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,148
where you can both not cooperate.

2023
01:22:22,148 --> 01:22:25,010
There are ways in which
you can solve this,

2024
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,273
so-called prisoner's dilemma,

2025
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:28,460
by looking at previous behavior

2026
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,378
and making predictions about
the likely next behavior

2027
01:22:32,378 --> 01:22:35,690
that the other individual will engage in.

2028
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:36,990
And there do seem to be neurons

2029
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:40,623
that are doing these sorts of
predictions or computations.

2030
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:44,234
Again, I'll go into this in
more detail in the future.

2031
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:46,530
So rather than thinking
about mirror neurons,

2032
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:47,755
like neurons for empathy,

2033
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:50,256
I think it's more correct

2034
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,940
to think about neurons

2035
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:54,310
that are trying to predict
the behavior of others.

2036
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:55,460
And that's, as we said,

2037
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:58,830
one of the core features of emotions,

2038
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:01,460
which are to establish bonds,

2039
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,490
and through those bonds,

2040
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,010
to be able to predict behavior.

2041
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:07,174
So oxytocin is one
component of this ability

2042
01:23:07,174 --> 01:23:11,450
to predict others' behavior
and to guide our own behavior.

2043
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:13,601
So here's some experiments

2044
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:17,593
that involve the administration
of intranasal oxytocin.

2045
01:23:18,522 --> 01:23:20,450
Now I think you need a prescription,

2046
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:21,680
although in some places you don't.

2047
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,470
There are people who are
taking intranasal oxytocin

2048
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,826
in order to try and increase
the depth of bonding.

2049
01:23:26,826 --> 01:23:29,610
And I don't recommend you do that.

2050
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:30,650
I've never tried that.

2051
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:32,520
Whatever oxytocin I've released,

2052
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,463
I've made without an intranasal
exogenous application.

2053
01:23:36,463 --> 01:23:39,550
But what's been reported

2054
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:43,070
is increased positive
communication among couples.

2055
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:46,620
So people have taken
intranasal oxytocin in studies.

2056
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,210
So that study,

2057
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,043
for those of you like,

2058
01:23:49,043 --> 01:23:50,500
was published in Biological Psychiatry,

2059
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,483
which my psychiatry colleagues
tell me is a fine journal.

2060
01:23:53,483 --> 01:23:54,930
And the title is

2061
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,860
intranasal oxytocin increases
positive communication

2062
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:00,350
and reduces the stress
hormone cortisol levels

2063
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:02,556
during couple conflict,

2064
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:03,634
they have them fight,

2065
01:24:03,634 --> 01:24:07,559
or they have them fight
with and without oxytocin.

2066
01:24:07,559 --> 01:24:08,658
So interesting.

2067
01:24:08,658 --> 01:24:12,340
Very much in line with
the idea that oxytocin

2068
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:14,242
is the "trust hormone."

2069
01:24:14,242 --> 01:24:16,920
That's sort of in keeping with that.

2070
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,107
That was a 2009 paper.

2071
01:24:19,107 --> 01:24:20,949
There's other evidence, for instance,

2072
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:25,410
that men report a greater sense
of connection and intimacy

2073
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:26,660
with their partners during sex

2074
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,736
after taking intranasal oxytocin.

2075
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:32,670
There are studies in autistic children.

2076
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:34,986
Giving them intranasal oxytocin as a way

2077
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:38,934
to try and help them establish
better social connection

2078
01:24:38,934 --> 01:24:42,820
and "empathy" or theory of mind.

2079
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,470
I've talked about theory of mind before,

2080
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:48,200
were understanding of what other children

2081
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,160
and adults are experiencing.

2082
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,012
Oxytocin does seem to create
these general effects,

2083
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:58,850
and how nuanced they are in
one situation or another,

2084
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:59,860
I don't know.

2085
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:01,420
I'm aware and I was told,

2086
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,930
and I'm definitely not recommending this,

2087
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:07,390
that there's a marketed
oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.

2088
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:08,662
Now I have no idea.

2089
01:25:08,662 --> 01:25:10,470
Maybe someone can put in the comments

2090
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:14,240
why you'd want to combine
oxytocin and ketamine.

2091
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,672
I can't imagine why.

2092
01:25:15,672 --> 01:25:18,250
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic

2093
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,036
that's used for the treatment of PTSD.

2094
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:22,373
It used to be used as a recreational drug.

2095
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:27,373
It's very similar to PCP,
seems quite dangerous in fact.

2096
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:32,135
I don't know why those two
things would be combined,

2097
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:34,670
why one would want to combine them.

2098
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:37,020
But there are products out there

2099
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,590
that seem to combine those two things.

2100
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:41,620
And I'm not certain why one would do that,

2101
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:45,220
but it's interesting to
note that it's happening.

2102
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,910
A particularly interesting
study about oxytocin is that,

2103
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,670
that was published in the
journal, Neuroscience,

2104
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:50,503
which is a good journal,

2105
01:25:50,503 --> 01:25:53,440
that oxytocin modulates

2106
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,047
social distance between males and females.

2107
01:25:56,047 --> 01:25:57,510
So that's interesting.

2108
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,474
What they did is they gave oxytocin

2109
01:25:59,474 --> 01:26:03,500
to people that were in
monogamous relationships,

2110
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,650
and then they evaluated
the extent to which the,

2111
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:07,483
in this case,

2112
01:26:07,483 --> 01:26:08,460
the males in those relationships

2113
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,840
would pay attention to visual attention

2114
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,120
to attractive other potential partners.

2115
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:14,953
And it seemed like

2116
01:26:14,953 --> 01:26:16,860
that the general takeaway from this study

2117
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,610
is that oxytocin administration

2118
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,930
seemed to promote monogamous behavior.

2119
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:22,290
So behavior that wasn't in line

2120
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,450
with monogamy of the
relationship that they were in

2121
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:28,040
as opposed to a foraging
for potentially new mates.

2122
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,290
Now of course, these are
somewhat artificial experiments

2123
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,620
or very artificial experiments,

2124
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,400
depending on how you interpret them.

2125
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,170
But the general theme

2126
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:40,010
is that oxytocin is promoting monogamy,

2127
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:41,510
it's promoting pair bonding,

2128
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,380
it's promoting

2129
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:46,286
a understanding of the
internal state of others,

2130
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:49,360
which requires enhanced exteroception

2131
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,890
for those particular others.

2132
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:54,070
So not just generally
having them look everywhere

2133
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:55,250
and see what's going on in the world,

2134
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,799
but particularly paying attention

2135
01:26:56,799 --> 01:26:59,222
to the emotional states of others.

2136
01:26:59,222 --> 01:27:01,167
I'm sure several of you will be asking,

2137
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:03,186
"Well, what can I do
to increase oxytocin,"

2138
01:27:03,186 --> 01:27:04,425
if that's your goal.

2139
01:27:04,425 --> 01:27:05,710
There's some evidence.

2140
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:06,630
And I invite you again

2141
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:11,160
to go to examine.com or
another such site like PubMed

2142
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,473
if you want to forage PubMed,

2143
01:27:12,473 --> 01:27:16,340
that vitamin D is required
for proper production,

2144
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,190
and in some cases

2145
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,610
can increase levels of
oxytocin when supplemented,

2146
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,730
which is interesting.

2147
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,860
And that believe it or not, melatonin,

2148
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:24,950
or old friend melatonin,

2149
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:29,370
which I have pushed back against
as a supplement for sleep,

2150
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:32,210
because of what I view

2151
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,278
as untoward side effects
of melatonin in most cases,

2152
01:27:35,278 --> 01:27:38,152
but it seems like melatonin in some cases

2153
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:41,680
can prime the system

2154
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,690
for slightly increased oxytocin release.

2155
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:45,870
There's even one report,

2156
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:48,240
although it didn't look that strong to me

2157
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:51,850
that low doses of caffeine
could increase oxytocin release.

2158
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,550
But that to me falls under the category

2159
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,100
of what was once described

2160
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,630
as a drug when injected
into a person or animal

2161
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:02,810
is always effective at
producing a scientific paper.

2162
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,210
Meaning that you can get a result,

2163
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:06,200
but the result isn't always so robust.

2164
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,530
So you always want to read past
the titles and the abstracts

2165
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:10,310
and get into the meat of the paper.

2166
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:11,143
And when I did that,

2167
01:28:11,143 --> 01:28:13,240
the effects were pretty negligible

2168
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,560
with caffeine on oxytocin.

2169
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,910
But it's interesting that
vitamin D and melatonin

2170
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:19,640
may have some positive
effects on oxytocin release.

2171
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,530
But like I said,

2172
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:22,004
many people are just taking oxytocin

2173
01:28:22,004 --> 01:28:24,770
directly through these intranasal sprays.

2174
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:28,270
I'm pretty sure it's prescription
in most places, but check.

2175
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,360
And again, I'm not
recommending anybody do that.

2176
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,193
I've never tried it.

2177
01:28:31,193 --> 01:28:32,300
I don't know that I will.

2178
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,300
I think I'm going to stick with
the oxytocin that I've got.

2179
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,730
The other molecule that we make

2180
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:39,812
that's extremely important for
social bonds and emotionality

2181
01:28:39,812 --> 01:28:41,940
is one that we're going to talk about more

2182
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,792
in the month on hormones,
that's vasopressin.

2183
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:48,733
Vasopressin suppresses urination.

2184
01:28:50,112 --> 01:28:51,298
It's made by the body,

2185
01:28:51,298 --> 01:28:53,970
but it was developed as a treatment

2186
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,850
for something called diabetes insipidus,

2187
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:57,635
where people urinate excessively,

2188
01:28:57,635 --> 01:28:59,576
and they actually risk dehydration

2189
01:28:59,576 --> 01:29:02,030
and they can lose a lot of
electrolytes, et cetera.

2190
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:03,527
So it causes water retention.

2191
01:29:03,527 --> 01:29:06,960
Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin.

2192
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,390
So large amounts of alcohol,

2193
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:11,940
many people excrete, a
lot of fluid and so forth.

2194
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,705
Vasopressin has effects
on the brain directly.

2195
01:29:14,705 --> 01:29:18,444
It actually creates
feelings of giddy love.

2196
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:22,710
It also increases memory
in very potent ways.

2197
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:24,606
There's a whole biohacking community

2198
01:29:24,606 --> 01:29:28,709
that has been dabbling with
vasopressin for some time.

2199
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:30,090
I have never tried it.

2200
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:31,020
I certainly don't recommend it.

2201
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,950
It is prescription.

2202
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:37,517
It is a pretty serious
compound to start messing with,

2203
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,040
because it has so many
different effects in the body.

2204
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:46,141
It's interesting because it
creates the sense of giddy love.

2205
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:49,706
It's also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac,

2206
01:29:49,706 --> 01:29:51,778
so it's similar to oxytocin.

2207
01:29:51,778 --> 01:29:54,000
It also has very interesting effects

2208
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,827
on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior.

2209
01:29:56,827 --> 01:29:59,490
This, again, we will
revisit in the future.

2210
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:02,380
But there's a beautiful set of experiments

2211
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,500
that have been done in
a little rodent species

2212
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,910
called a prairie vole.

2213
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:06,743
It turns out

2214
01:30:06,743 --> 01:30:08,130
there are two different
populations of prairie voles,

2215
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:09,130
some are monogamous,

2216
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:12,750
they always meet with the
same other prairie vole,

2217
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:16,300
and some are very robustly non-monogamous,

2218
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,680
they mate with as many other
prairie voles as they can.

2219
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,750
And turns out that levels of vasopressin

2220
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,680
and/or vasopressin receptor

2221
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,627
dictate whether or not
they're monogamous or not.

2222
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:27,168
And there's actually some
interesting evidence in humans.

2223
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:29,520
When people report their behavior,

2224
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,034
assuming they're reporting accurately,

2225
01:30:31,034 --> 01:30:33,498
that vasopressin and vasopressin levels

2226
01:30:33,498 --> 01:30:35,006
can relate to monogamy

2227
01:30:35,006 --> 01:30:37,430
or non-monogamy in humans as well.

2228
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:41,010
We're going to talk about
this in the month on hormones.

2229
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,810
If we're talking about the
neuroscience of emotions,

2230
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,542
we have to talk about the vagus nerve.

2231
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:47,840
I described what the vagus
nerve is in a previous episode,

2232
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,260
that it's these connections

2233
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,560
between the body and the viscera,

2234
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,100
including the gut, the heart, the lungs

2235
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,040
and the immune system and the brain,

2236
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,570
and that the brain is also
controlling these organs.

2237
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:58,983
So it's a two-way street.

2238
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:02,105
There's this big myth out
there that I mentioned before,

2239
01:31:02,105 --> 01:31:05,465
that stimulating the vagus in various ways

2240
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:07,050
leads to calmness.

2241
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,664
That it's always going to calm you down.

2242
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:10,680
And that is false.

2243
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,400
I just want to repeat
that is completely false.

2244
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,040
In fact, it was just
paper, yet another paper

2245
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,210
published the other day,

2246
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,820
which is fantastic, which
is from David McCormick Lab

2247
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:19,741
up at the University of Oregon.

2248
01:31:19,741 --> 01:31:22,491
It's published in Current
Biology, excellent journal,

2249
01:31:22,491 --> 01:31:24,824
showing, I'm just reading the title,

2250
01:31:24,824 --> 01:31:28,700
vagus nerve stimulation
induces widespread cortical,

2251
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,340
the neocortex and behavioral activation.

2252
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,918
I've read the paper, it's fantastic.

2253
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:35,255
It illustrates yet again,

2254
01:31:35,255 --> 01:31:38,480
stimulation of the vagus
increases dopamine release,

2255
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,836
increases activation
of the brain alertness.

2256
01:31:41,836 --> 01:31:45,260
It is a stimulant of alertness,

2257
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,800
it is not calming people down.

2258
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,809
Now this is interesting
in light of emotionality

2259
01:31:50,809 --> 01:31:55,670
because of work that's
been done by many groups,

2260
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:56,930
but in particular,

2261
01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:58,820
I'm going to focus on the
work of a colleague of mine,

2262
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:01,410
Karl Deisseroth at Stanford,
who's a psychiatrist,

2263
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:02,801
but has also developed a lot of tools

2264
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:07,180
to adjust the activity
of neurons in real time

2265
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,644
using light and electrical
stimulation and so forth.

2266
01:32:09,644 --> 01:32:12,670
I'll refer you to an
article in the New Yorker

2267
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,240
that was published about
this a few years ago

2268
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,940
I'm going to read a brief excerpt.

2269
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,159
I'll put the link in the caption as well.

2270
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:23,087
He's talking to an extremely
suicidal depressed patient

2271
01:32:23,087 --> 01:32:26,440
who has a small device implanted

2272
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,070
that allows her to adjust
her vagus nerve activity.

2273
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,360
Now vagus stimulation

2274
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,910
was originally developed for
the treatment of epilepsy.

2275
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:35,762
It's now being used for
various other purposes.

2276
01:32:35,762 --> 01:32:40,660
Vagus stimulation can even
increase plasticity, it seems.

2277
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:43,470
So again, increasing activity of the vagus

2278
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:44,397
increases alertness,

2279
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:48,160
and it's just incredible to
see what happens in real time

2280
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,884
to emotionality when
the vagus is stimulated,

2281
01:32:50,884 --> 01:32:54,760
again, not calming, but
activating alertness.

2282
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:57,280
They're in his office and they're talking,

2283
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,400
and he asks her how she's doing,

2284
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,547
and she describes how
she's been doing previously

2285
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,550
as "going pancake,"

2286
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:08,460
which for her just means
totally laid out flat,

2287
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,572
not much going on.

2288
01:33:09,572 --> 01:33:13,080
She talks about how she
doesn't want to pursue a job.

2289
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,157
She's really depressed.

2290
01:33:14,157 --> 01:33:18,947
And he says in typical
good psychiatrist fashion,

2291
01:33:18,947 --> 01:33:20,320
"Well, that's a lot to think about,"

2292
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:21,620
that's actually the quote.

2293
01:33:23,107 --> 01:33:26,150
And they talk about her
blood pressure, et cetera.

2294
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:27,848
And then she says,

2295
01:33:27,848 --> 01:33:30,350
mood's been down, just spiraling down,

2296
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:33,361
talks about insomnia,
bad dreams, low appetite.

2297
01:33:33,361 --> 01:33:35,800
So this is severe depression.

2298
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,061
This is what we call major depression.

2299
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:39,147
And then she requests,

2300
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:43,110
"Can we please go up to
1.5 on vagus stimulation?"

2301
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,448
She'd been receiving 1.2 milli amps

2302
01:33:45,448 --> 01:33:48,062
of stimulation every five
minutes to 30 seconds

2303
01:33:48,062 --> 01:33:50,613
but was no longer able
to feel the effects.

2304
01:33:50,613 --> 01:33:51,547
So he says,

2305
01:33:51,547 --> 01:33:53,030
"Okay, I think we can go up a little,

2306
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:54,580
you're tolerating things well."

2307
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,767
They start the stimulation and,

2308
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:03,437
"In the course of the next few
minutes," her name was Sally,

2309
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:06,040
"underwent a remarkable
change, her frown disappeared.

2310
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,065
She became cheerful,

2311
01:34:07,065 --> 01:34:08,810
describing the pleasure she'd had

2312
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:09,810
during the Christmas holiday

2313
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:10,990
and recounting how she'd recently

2314
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:13,243
watched some YouTube videos of Deisseroth.

2315
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:17,026
She was still smiling and
talking when the session ended,

2316
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:19,420
and they walked out to
the reception area."

2317
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,940
So this is just by stimulating
and activating the vagus.

2318
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,190
Now why am I bringing this up?

2319
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:27,680
Well, for several reasons, one
is the vagus is fascinating

2320
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,160
in terms of the brain body connection,

2321
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:33,135
two, I'd like to, trying
to dispel the myth

2322
01:34:33,135 --> 01:34:35,980
that vagus stimulation
is all about being calm,

2323
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,086
it's really about being alert.

2324
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:39,830
I don't know how that
originally got going backwards,

2325
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:41,933
but it's about being alert.

2326
01:34:41,933 --> 01:34:46,150
And once again, level of
alertness or level of calmness

2327
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:47,830
is impacting emotion,

2328
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:49,761
that this axis of alertness and calmness

2329
01:34:49,761 --> 01:34:54,430
is one primary axis in emotion.

2330
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:55,550
It's not the only one,

2331
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:58,546
because there's also this
valence component of good or bad.

2332
01:34:58,546 --> 01:35:00,440
Those two aren't the only ones,

2333
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,660
because there's also this component

2334
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,330
of interoceptive, exteroceptive

2335
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:04,210
that we talked about earlier.

2336
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:05,710
And there will be others too.

2337
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:07,220
Again, it's not exhaustive.

2338
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:08,257
But I find it fascinating,

2339
01:35:08,257 --> 01:35:11,200
and it really brings us
back to where we started,

2340
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,209
which is what are the
core elements of emotion,

2341
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:15,220
and what can you do about them?

2342
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:18,990
And before we close up today,
I just want to make sure that

2343
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:20,360
even though I've mentioned some tools,

2344
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,840
I talked about the Mood Meter app,

2345
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,187
I talked about oxytocin

2346
01:35:25,187 --> 01:35:27,236
and some of the things
that impact oxytocin,

2347
01:35:27,236 --> 01:35:29,830
I talked about some of the ways

2348
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:31,919
that you can conceptualize emotions.

2349
01:35:31,919 --> 01:35:34,700
This business of how you
conceptualize emotions

2350
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:37,760
is really the most powerful
tool you can ever have

2351
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,850
in terms of understanding

2352
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,490
and regulating your emotional state.

2353
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:44,400
If you're willing to try and
wrap your head around it,

2354
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,760
I realize it's not the
simplest thing to do.

2355
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,640
But rather than think of
emotions as just these labels,

2356
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:52,743
happy, sad, or depressed,

2357
01:35:52,743 --> 01:35:55,631
thinking about emotions, excuse me,

2358
01:35:55,631 --> 01:36:00,242
as elements of the brain and body

2359
01:36:00,242 --> 01:36:03,000
that encompass levels of alertness

2360
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,570
that include a dynamic
with the outside world

2361
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:07,427
and your perception of
your internal state.

2362
01:36:07,427 --> 01:36:10,300
And starting to really
think about emotions

2363
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,411
in a structured way

2364
01:36:11,411 --> 01:36:14,400
cannot only allow you to understand

2365
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,460
some of the pathology

2366
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:18,190
of when you might feel
depressed or anxious

2367
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,415
or others are depressed and anxious,

2368
01:36:19,415 --> 01:36:20,950
but also to develop

2369
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:23,810
a richer emotional experience to anything.

2370
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,190
Now of course, I don't expect that

2371
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,610
as you're out there
interacting with friends

2372
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:29,520
and you're watching TV
and experiencing life,

2373
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,590
that you should be parsing
every bit of your experience

2374
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:34,860
in some sort of reductionist
and mechanistic way.

2375
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:35,994
That's not the goal here.

2376
01:36:35,994 --> 01:36:37,842
But for those of you
that are practitioners,

2377
01:36:37,842 --> 01:36:39,720
teachers of any kind,

2378
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,970
for those of you that are kids,

2379
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,980
for those of you that
are trying to understand

2380
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:46,190
what your emotional life
and your consciousness,

2381
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:47,408
dare I say the word,

2382
01:36:47,408 --> 01:36:49,080
really consists of,

2383
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,884
I do believe that these
are fundamental elements

2384
01:36:51,884 --> 01:36:54,420
that are well-supported by the science

2385
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:56,009
across a variety of researchers

2386
01:36:56,009 --> 01:36:59,512
doing things from a variety
of different perspectives

2387
01:36:59,512 --> 01:37:01,500
and some of whom agree with one another

2388
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,720
and some of whom don't.

2389
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,950
So I offer it to you as
a source of knowledge

2390
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:08,200
from which you can start

2391
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,973
to think about your emotional
life differently, I hope,

2392
01:37:11,973 --> 01:37:13,690
as well as others

2393
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:16,350
in a way that builds more
richness into that experience,

2394
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:18,510
not that detracts from it.

2395
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:20,813
One last point as it relates to that,

2396
01:37:20,813 --> 01:37:24,610
many of you have asked me
about psychedelic therapies

2397
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:27,869
that are now emerging, things
like psilocybin and MDMA,

2398
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:29,820
we are of course

2399
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:32,300
going to dive into that topic deeply.

2400
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,181
We have an expert guest coming
on to discuss that topic.

2401
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:40,181
Those compounds clearly affect
the aspects of emotionality

2402
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,921
that we were talking about today,

2403
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:47,290
calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad,

2404
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:50,548
interoceptive, exteroceptive positioning.

2405
01:37:50,548 --> 01:37:55,390
And so rather than just do a
kind of cursory exploration

2406
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:56,250
of those compounds

2407
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,350
and what the therapeutic
and scientific community

2408
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:00,809
is thinking about them
and how they function,

2409
01:38:00,809 --> 01:38:02,700
I think it's more important

2410
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,934
to embed that framework in our thinking

2411
01:38:04,934 --> 01:38:07,480
so that when we address psychedelics

2412
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,048
and we address other sorts of therapies,

2413
01:38:09,048 --> 01:38:10,608
cognitive behavioral therapy,

2414
01:38:10,608 --> 01:38:12,535
different types of emotive therapies

2415
01:38:12,535 --> 01:38:15,648
that relate to individuals
and couples et cetera,

2416
01:38:15,648 --> 01:38:18,485
that we are able to think about them

2417
01:38:18,485 --> 01:38:20,658
with some sort of structure and rigor

2418
01:38:20,658 --> 01:38:23,669
rather than just talk about
them as a bunch of chemicals

2419
01:38:23,669 --> 01:38:25,698
that produce these amazing experiences

2420
01:38:25,698 --> 01:38:28,130
that people need to tell you about.

2421
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:29,820
Because if there's one truth,

2422
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,830
it seems that psychedelic
seem to promote activity

2423
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:35,240
of storytelling about
psychedelic experience.

2424
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,730
But that itself is not really
what the therapeutic community

2425
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,462
and the academic communities
are interested in,

2426
01:38:41,462 --> 01:38:43,478
they're interested in trying to understand

2427
01:38:43,478 --> 01:38:45,303
the universal truths,

2428
01:38:45,303 --> 01:38:48,940
the universal biological
shifts and psychological shifts

2429
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:51,840
that occur in the clinical
use of those compounds.

2430
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,560
And so we're going to hold off for now,

2431
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,010
but we will get to them.

2432
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:56,040
Once again, we've covered

2433
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,840
an enormous amount of material today.

2434
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,130
It's really the equivalent of two

2435
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:02,649
if not three university
lectures in one podcast episode.

2436
01:39:02,649 --> 01:39:05,657
I want to thank those of you
that have supported the podcast

2437
01:39:05,657 --> 01:39:07,221
and point to ways in which

2438
01:39:07,221 --> 01:39:08,921
all of you can support the podcast.

2439
01:39:08,921 --> 01:39:11,158
Many of these are cost-free.

2440
01:39:11,158 --> 01:39:13,459
The first is to please
subscribe on YouTube

2441
01:39:13,459 --> 01:39:16,600
and as well to hit the
notifications button

2442
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,564
so that when we release new videos,

2443
01:39:18,564 --> 01:39:20,448
which typically is every Monday

2444
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,890
for the full length episodes,

2445
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,274
but we also know how short clips,

2446
01:39:23,274 --> 01:39:25,599
that you'll be notified.

2447
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:29,248
As well if you could subscribe
on Apple and Spotify,

2448
01:39:29,248 --> 01:39:31,750
and leave us a review on Apple.

2449
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:33,810
You have the opportunity to
leave us a five-star review

2450
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,670
if you think we deserve
a five-star review.

2451
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:38,350
Please tell your friends
and family and co-workers

2452
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:39,183
about the podcast

2453
01:39:39,183 --> 01:39:40,062
if you think the material

2454
01:39:40,062 --> 01:39:42,921
would be of interest and
informative for them,

2455
01:39:42,921 --> 01:39:45,962
and if you want to send them
links, that's terrific too.

2456
01:39:45,962 --> 01:39:48,175
We also have a Patreon account.

2457
01:39:48,175 --> 01:39:51,880
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2458
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,683
And there you can support us
at any level that you like.

2459
01:39:54,683 --> 01:39:57,410
In addition, if you could
check out our sponsors,

2460
01:39:57,410 --> 01:40:00,422
we always provide links to
those sponsors in the captions.

2461
01:40:00,422 --> 01:40:03,020
That's the best way to
support the podcast.

2462
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,895
And several of you have
asked about supplements.

2463
01:40:05,895 --> 01:40:08,670
I talk about supplements
in various episodes.

2464
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:09,900
We've partnered with Thorne

2465
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,660
because we think Thorne

2466
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:13,442
has the very highest levels of stringency

2467
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:15,757
in terms of the purity of the contents

2468
01:40:15,757 --> 01:40:18,030
and the amounts of the contents.

2469
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,650
They really put in the bottle
what's listed on the bottle,

2470
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:23,107
which is not true for a lot
of supplement companies.

2471
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:25,510
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

2472
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:27,080
as well as get a discount on those

2473
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,370
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes,

2474
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:33,826
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

2475
01:40:33,826 --> 01:40:36,678
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

2476
01:40:36,678 --> 01:40:39,120
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

2477
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:44,120
So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E
dotcom slash the letter U

2478
01:40:45,263 --> 01:40:47,200
slash Huberman

2479
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:50,303
to get 20% off any
supplements that Thorne makes.

2480
01:40:50,303 --> 01:40:52,760
And last but certainly not least,

2481
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,714
I want to thank you for
your time and attention.

2482
01:40:54,714 --> 01:40:57,203
And thank you for your
interest in science.
