00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,930
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,700
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,822
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:08,405
[gentle music]

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,770
and I'm a professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,800
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,980
This podcast is separate

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,410
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,450
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,330
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,390
and science-related tools
to the general public.

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,580
In keeping with that theme,

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,520
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,900
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,220
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,530
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,300
to help you better understand your body

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,730
and help you reach your health goals.

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,897
I've long been a fan of
getting blood work done.

21
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,800
And the simple reason for that,

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,010
is that most of the things
that you want to know

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,740
about your health, such as
hormones, metabolic factors,

24
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,520
blood sugar levels, et cetera,

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,940
can only be analyzed from blood.

26
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,380
And nowadays there are
also excellent DNA tests

27
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,570
that can also give you
valuable information

28
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,209
about what's going on at
the cellar, molecular,

29
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,800
even the neural circuit level
within your brain and body.

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,970
InsideTracker makes getting
blood and DNA tests easy.

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,900
You can go to a testing site
where they draw your blood,

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,100
they take your DNA sample,

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,680
or they can come to your
home if you prefer that.

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,960
As well, they have a
really amazing dashboard.

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,410
The dashboard lets you understand

36
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,480
what your levels of various hormones

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,350
and metabolic factors et cetera mean,

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,707
and what you should do about them.

39
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,520
And I think that's one of the main things

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,450
that really separates InsideTracker

41
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,580
apart from other blood and DNA tests.

42
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,940
Most tests you get the results back,

43
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,190
but there are no directives
about what to do specifically

44
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,270
in order to bring the
numbers into the ranges

45
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,920
that you would like for your goals.

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,070
InsideTracker makes all
of that extremely simple

47
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,830
and extremely clear.

48
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,330
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

49
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,370
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,

53

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,800
any of InsideTrackers plans.

55
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,009
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

56
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,649
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

57
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,070
vitamin, mineral probiotic drink.

58
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,960
I started taking Athletic
Greens back in 2012

59
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,110
and I've taken it ever since.

60
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,630
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

61
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,640
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,410
and the reason I still take it now,

63
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,530
is that Athletic Greens

64
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,720
really lets me cover
all my nutritional basis

65
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,040
in terms of vitamins,
minerals and probiotics.

66
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
There's so much data now

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,510
pointing to the fact
that the gut microbiome

68
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,340
and the gut brain axis is
important for metabolism

69
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,960
and for endocrine health.

70
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,270
The vitamins, minerals and
probiotics in Athletic Greens

71
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,120
make me feel confident that
I'm covering all my bases.

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,250
I do take other supplements,
but with Athletic Greens

73
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,420
I know that I've got all the
foundational stuff handled.

74
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,940
It also tastes really good.

75
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,090
Tastes fine on its own,

76
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,700
you can mix it with
water, which is what I do.

77
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,493
I add a little bit of
lemon juice or lime juice,

78
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:56,660
because I like a little tartness
flavor in there as well,

79
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,750
but most people just mix it with water,

80
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,210
it mixes up super easily.

81
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,660
I drink it once or twice a day.

82
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,010
Usually once mid morning, and
once again in the afternoon.

83
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,570
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

84
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,850
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

85
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,430
And if you do that, you can
claim their special offer

86
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,960
which is a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

87
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,210
There is now a ton of
evidence that vitamin D3

88
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,140
is involved in countless
metabolic processes,

89
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,770
hormonal processes that are important

90
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,060
for overall health and wellbeing.

91
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Vitamin D3, you can get
from the sun of course,

92
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,050
but most people are
deficient in vitamin D3.

93
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,890
So if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman

94
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,120
you'll get the Athletic Greens,

95
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
you'll get the year's
supply of vitamin D3 and K2

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,370
and you'll get five free travel packs.

97
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,280
So once again it's
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,517
to get Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2,

99
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,490
and that's a year supply plus
the five free travel packs.

100
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,840
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Munk Pack.

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,520
Munk Pack is a company that
makes keto-friendly snacks

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,900
that taste incredible

103
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,170
but have just one gram of sugar or less.

104
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,140
And indeed they taste incredible.

105
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,970
In fact, my production team
here at the Huberman Lab Podcast

106
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,390
teases me because I actually
have to keep the boxes

107
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,250
of Munk Pack bars in my basement

108
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,420
'cause otherwise I'll
tear through all of them.

109
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,697
I remember the first time
I tasted it, I was like,

110
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,290
all right, here we go, a keto bar.

111
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,070
I'm not a big fan of bars in general,

112
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,430
most of them don't taste good to me.

113
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,209
And I tasted the Munk Pack bars,

114
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,049
and they are absolutely awesome.

115
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,800
They come in a lot of different flavors.

116
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm partial to the caramel sea salt one,

117
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,490
but they also have sea
salt dark chocolate,

118
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,610
peanut butter dark chocolate.

119
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,890
They have a bunch of flavors.

120
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,890
They're all incredible,
I've tried them all.

121
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,120
Which is why I keep them in my basement.

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
As I mentioned previously on this podcast,

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,620
I'm neither keto nor carbo.

124
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,110
I don't really follow a
particular diet in that sense.

125
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,760
I eat in a way that maximizes my alertness

126
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,510
and my levels of focus during
the day when I want to work,

127
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,670
and that maximize my
transition to sleep at night.

128
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,470
So, I basically eat low carb
keto-ish during the day.

129
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,090
And I know the ketonistas will
say that I'm not in ketosis

130
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,940
and I can manage to get into ketosis.

131
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,020
But the main idea,

132
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,330
is I keep my carbohydrates
low during the day.

133
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,380
And then at night I do eat carbohydrates.

134
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,850
So for me, the Munk Pack
bars are a really good snack

135
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,360
usually in the afternoon,
with a cup of coffee,

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,530
especially if I'm going
to train soon after that,

137
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,350
or if I just want to snack and
I'm going to continue working.

138
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,260
As I mentioned before, they
are absolutely delicious.

139
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,030
They also don't have any of
the stuff that's bad for you.

140
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,540
No soy, trans fat, sugar,
alcohols, artificial colors,

141
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,970
all that stuff that we
know we should avoid.

142
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,650
If you want to try Munk Pack
bars, you can go to Munk Pack,

150
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,220
This month, we're talking
all about hormones.

151
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,280
Hormones are incredible

152
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,680
and they control so many
processes in the brain and body.

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,940
Last episode, we talked about

154
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,430
the role of estrogen and testosterone.

155
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,480
Today we're going to talk about

156
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,920
how hormones impact feeding and hunger,

157
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,630
as well as satiety, the feeling
that you don't want to eat

158
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,790
or that you've eaten enough.

159
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,070
Now, it's important to understand

160
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,740
that hormones don't work
alone in this context.

161
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,550
Today I'm going to describe some hormones

162
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,170
that have powerful effects

163
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,460
on whether or not you
want to eat more or less

164
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,810
or stop eating altogether.

165
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,860
But they don't do that on their own,

166
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,830
they do that in cooperation
with the nervous system.

167
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,110
So today, I would say as much

168
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,730
or perhaps even more
than any other episodes,

169
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,790
we're going to hear a lot of biology

170
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,500
but there are multiple what
I'm going to call entry points

171
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,720
for tools that you can apply

172
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,780
in order to regulate
your levels of hunger,

173
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,580
your meal timing, your levels of satiety

174
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,440
of not wanting to eat more.

175
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,380
And many of this is
actionable with behaviors,

176
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,420
but of course, we're also
going to talk about supplements

177
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,760
and we're actually going to talk about

178
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,220
a little bit of brain
machine interface devices

179
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,560
that can actually be involved

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,570
in manipulating these incredible things

181
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,270
that we think of as hunger
and appetite and satiety.

182
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,150
So, the first thing that you need to know

183
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,860
about the nervous system side,

184
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,230
the neural control,
over-feeding and hunger,

185
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,700
is that there's an area of your brain

186
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,280
called the hypothalamus.

187
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,310
It's in the forebrain,

188
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,080
which tells you it's in
the front of your brain,

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,690
and it's at the base of the forebrain.

190
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,400
Now, the hypothalamus contains

191
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,930
lots of different kinds of neurons

192
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,860
doing lots of different kinds of things.

193
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,240
There are neurons in your hypothalamus

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,650
controlling sexual behavior,
controlling body temperature,

195
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,200
controlling circadian rhythms,

196
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,830
the desire to sleep or be awake.

197
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,970
Even neurons controlling rage.

198
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,140
There are actually neurons that
if we were to stimulate them

199
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,343
would send you or anyone into a rage.

200
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:31,650
They're just powerful control centers

201
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,823
for the brain and body.

202
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,160
There's a particular
area of the hypothalamus

203
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,080
called the ventromedial hypothalamus.

204
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,520
And it's one that researchers
have been interested

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,500
for a long time now, in
terms of its relationship

206
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
to hunger and feeding.

207
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,510
And the reason is, it creates
these paradoxical effects.

208
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,420
What do I mean by that?

209
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,010
What they found was that
sometimes lesioning,

210
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,890
or disrupting the neurons in
the ventromedial hypothalamus

211
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,240
would make animals or people hyperphasia,

212
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,540
they would want to eat crazy.

213
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,740
And other lesions in other
individuals or animals

214
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,010
would make them anorexic,

215
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,810
it would make them not want to eat at all.

216
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,470
It would make food aversive.

217
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,950
So that means that the
ventromedial hypothalamus

218
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,010
is definitely an
interesting control station

219
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,910
for hunger and feeding and satiety,

220
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,950
but it doesn't really
tell you what's going on

221
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,010
at a deeper level.

222
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,870
In fact, it's a little bit
confusing or paradoxical.

223
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,830
It turns out that there
are multiple populations

224
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,640
of neurons in there, we're
going to talk about those.

225
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,270
Some are promoting feeding,

226
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,100
and some are promoting
not feeding or not eating.

227
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,590
Now, the other neural
component of all this

228
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,179
that you need to know about,

229
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,009
actually has to do with your mouth.

230
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,330
So there's an area of your cortex,

231
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,940
so that's a little bit
further up in your brain,

232
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,600
called the insular cortex.

233
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,990
And it processes a lot of
different kinds of information.

234
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,430
Mostly information about
what's going on inside you,

235
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,460
so called the interoception.

236
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,800
The insular cortex has neurons

237
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,310
that get input from your mouth,

238
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,430
from the touch receptors in your mouth.

239
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,890
And insular cortex has powerful control

240
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,550
over whether or not you're
enjoying what you're eating,

241
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,900
whether or not you want to
avoid what you're eating,

242
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,240
whether or not you had enough,

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,060
or whether or not you want
to continue eating more.

244
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,910
And that has to do, believe it or not,

245
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,490
with the touch or sensation of eating.

246
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,323
I'm very familiar with this.

247
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm one of these people,
I love eating so much,

248
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,490
that I just like the mere act of chewing.

249
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,760
You know, I like celery sticks enough.

250
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,070
I'm not crazy about them, but
you know they taste fine to me

251
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,903
and I like chewing on celery sticks,

252
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:27,600
but I actually just like chewing on them.

253
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,750
I could eat all day long

254
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,100
except that it's not healthy to do that.

255
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,260
But the mere act of chewing
for me is very pleasurable.

256
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,860
People who chew gum feel this way as well.

257
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,170
And just as a point about gum or chewing,

258
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,380
if you choose something like celery

259
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,940
or cucumber slices or chew gum,

260
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,270
provided it doesn't have any
sugar or caloric content,

261
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,980
it's not going to drive increased hunger.

262
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,820
That generally isn't the case.

263
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,150
But if you eat something with
sugar, as we'll find out,

264
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,270
it has a very specific
action in the insular cortex

265
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,690
and in other areas of your nervous system

266
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,750
that promotes the desire to eat more.

267
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,060
But the key point right now

268
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,450
is to know you've got
these two brain areas,

269
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,110
the ventromedial hypothalamus,

270
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,460
that's involved in hunger
and lack of hunger,

271
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,970
sort of an accelerator
and a brake on feeding.

272
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,690
And you have this insular cortex

273
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,080
that gets input from your mouth,

274
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,280
and cares about chewing and
the consistency of foods

275
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,700
and all sorts of interesting things

276
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,190
that are just very tactile.

277
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,230
And I think most people think
about the touch receptors on,

278
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,350
excuse me, the taste
receptors on the tongue.

279
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,950
But we often don't think about

280
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,250
the touch or tactile essence of food.

281
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,900
And the thing that comes to mind just now

282
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,760
is I've gone to sushi several times,

283
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,650
and some people really like the urchin.

284
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,500
I don't like the urchin.

285
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,110
There's something about it
that kind of creeps me out

286
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,040
about the consistency,
other people love it.

287
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,360
So it's highly individual
and it's probably learned,

288
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,820
and there's some probably
cultural background to this

289
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,480
if you were raised eating urchin.

290
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,490
Some people love that
consistency or that touch.

291
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,700
So touch has a lot to do

292
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,850
with whether or not
you want to eat or not.

293
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,580
Now, let's get back to the
ventromedial hypothalamus.

294
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,330
Sometimes it makes animals
or people want to eat more,

295
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,370
sometimes less, so what's going on there?

296
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,690
There's a classic experiment that was done

297
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,250
in which researchers took two rats,

298
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,790
and so-called parabiosed
them to each other.

299
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,620
What that meant is that
they did a little surgery

300
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,410
and they linked their blood supply

301
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,170
so that they were forever
physically linked to one another

302
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,650
and could exchange factors in the blood,

303
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,720
but their brains were separate,
their mouths were separate,

304
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,990
and they essentially did
everything separately

305
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,300
except that they were
linked to one another.

306
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,160
So they had to walk together

307
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,360
and go to the same
places in order to do it.

308
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,710
This parabiosis experiment

309
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,750
revealed something really important.

310
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,900
When they lesioned the
ventromedial hypothalamus

311
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,210
in one of the rats that was
connected to the other rat,

312
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,430
that rat got very, very
fat, just really obese,

313
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,390
huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.

314
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,400
The other one however, got very thin,

315
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,960
it actually lost weight,

316
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,720
despite consuming the same
amount of food that it had

317
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,110
prior to the other one getting the lesion.

318
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,120
So what does this tell us?

319
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,590
This tells us that there's
something in the blood

320
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,120
that's being exchanged
between the two animals,

321
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,740
because it was their blood
supply that was linked.

322
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,450
And that tells us that there's
hormone or endocrine signals

323
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,670
that are involved in the desire to eat,

324
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,320
and hunger and appetite.

325
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,610
And so next, we're going to talk about

326
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,540
what those endocrine signals are,

327
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,590
and then I'm going to immediately point

328
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,650
to some entry points that you can use.

329
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,230
And you can use these

330
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,810
even if you're not parabiosed to anything.

331
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,880
And that can allow you to
time your meal frequency,

332
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,610
and predict when you're
going to be hungry or not.

333
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,220
As well as a drive up appetite.

334
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,570
Believe it or not, there
are people out there

335
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,370
who are trying to eat more.

336
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,340
Although I think far many more
people are trying to eat less

337
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,490
because nowadays, the data
just point to the fact

338
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,560
that there is essentially
an epidemic of diabetes,

339
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,490
type II diabetes and obesity.

340
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,110
And most everyone agrees now,

341
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,320
that maintaining a healthy body weight

342
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
and body weight composition,

343
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,790
is one of the best paths to longevity

344
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,160
and to just feeling very good

345
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,410
and actually being able to think.

346
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,570
Cognitive functioning

347
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,570
is actually linked to levels
of adipose tissue and so forth.

348
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,050
So, let's talk about the endocrine factors

349
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,860
that regulate feeding, hunger and satiety.

350
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,190
One of the really
exciting things to emerge

351
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,630
in the science of feeding and
appetite in the last 20 years,

352
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,600
is the discovery of another brain area.

353
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
And not just the
ventromedial hypothalamus,

354
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,770
but it's an area of the brain
called the arcuate nucleus.

355
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,920
And the arcuate nucleus

356
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,890
has some really
fascinating sets of neurons

357
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,380
that release even more
incredible molecules

358
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,450
and chemicals into the blood.

359
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,680
And these chemicals act as accelerators

360
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,940
on feeding and appetite, or breaks.

361
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,340
And the really cool thing

362
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,320
is that you can actually
control these molecules

363
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,510
through simple behaviors.

364
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,280
And once you understand
what these molecules are,

365
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,530
you'll start to understand
why that's the case.

366
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,210
And the control points
that you have right now

367
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,000
in order to control your
appetite in either direction,

368
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,970
increase or decrease.

369
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,070
So, first of all, there are set of neurons

370
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,950
in this arcuate nucleus
called the PMOC neurons, okay?

371
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,590
I don't want to get into
what the acronym stands for,

372
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,030
but I'll do it anyway.

373
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,930
It's the Proopiomelanocortin system, okay?

374
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,940
So these are PMOC neurons,
Proopiomelanocortin.

375
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,120
And if you heard melano,
that should tell you

376
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,810
it has something to do with pigmentation

377
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,660
in skin cells or in hair cells,
pigmentation of some sort,

378
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,850
because of melanin.

379
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,570
Last episode, I talked a little bit

380
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,020
about the relationship between
light dopamine and melanin.

381
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,830
So you should already be
thinking, wait, melano means

382
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,530
it probably has something
to do with that system,

383
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,220
and indeed it does.

384
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,627
Now, the POMC neurons, make
something called Alpha MSH.

385
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,050
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

386
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,170
Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

387
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,140
If you don't want to remember
any of the other acronyms

388
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,920
and terms I've talked
about, this episode so far,

389
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,860
do try and remember M-S-H, okay?

390
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,450
Mouse, Sam, Hamster, M-S-H, okay?

391
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,590
MSH reduces appetite

392
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,800
and it's a powerful molecule, all right?

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,460
So just put that on the shelf,

394
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,950
MSH reduces appetite.

395
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,880
Now, there's another population of neurons

396
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,810
in the arcuate nucleus,
called the AgRP neurons.

397
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,610
And there I'm truly not going
to read you what that stands for

398
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,220
'cause it's related to the mouse strain

399
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,410
it was first identified in,

400
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,410
but humans have these cells
as well, but AgRP neurons.

401
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,020
The AgRP neurons stimulate eating.

402
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,810
And anytime you are approaching food,

403
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,860
or you feel some excitement
about food or anxiety,

404
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,740
because some people actually experience

405
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,190
a kind of heightened anxiety.

406
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,800
Some people actually get a
little bit of a resting tremor

407
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,633
before they eat,

408
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,560
even if they don't have any
sort of eating disorder.

409
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,710
There's kind of a ramping
up of autonomic activity.

410
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,750
That's largely due to the
activity of these AgRP neurons.

411
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,640
So, the activity in these
AgRP neurons goes way up

412
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,050
when animals or people are starved.

413
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,730
And I don't mean starved
for long periods of time,

414
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,160
but I mean when they
haven't eaten for a while.

415
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,720
And the activity of MSH,
the release of MSH goes up

416
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,450
when we've eaten.

417
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,030
However, there are other
things that will stimulate

418
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,200
the release of things like MSH.

419
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,470
So, just briefly the
experimental evidence,

420
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,640
if you kill AgRP neurons,
animals and people stop eating.

421
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,530
There are people of lesions.

422
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,230
They just stop eating,
they become anorexic.

423
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,750
I know you're familiar with
anorexia as a clinical term,

424
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,540
but that's actually a term that's used

425
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,980
in the scientific literature

426
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,710
about a pattern of behavior, okay?

427
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,310
As well as a clinical term of course.

428
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,763
If you were to stimulate the AgRP neurons,

429
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,930
animals or people eat like crazy.

430
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,890
They will eat to the
point where they burst.

431
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,700
Which just sounds horrible,
but it just tells you

432
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,750
this is the accelerator on eating.

433
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,970
And yes, it has relationship

434
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,990
to the ventromedial hypothalamus
I talked about earlier,

435
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,200
but I don't want to go
back there just yet,

436
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,670
we will circle back.

437
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,640
So Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

438
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,450
such an interesting hormone.

439
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,463
This thing can shut
down the desire to eat.

440
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,493
The Melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

441
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,219
is released from the medial pituitary.

442
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,790
We talked about the pituitary last time.

443
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,490
This is a gland that is
very closely positioned

444
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,440
to the hypothalamus.

445
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
Actually some of the hypothalamus neurons

446
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,589
actually project their neural connections

447
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,529
directly into the pituitary,
to release things like

448
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,710
gonadotropins and luteinizing hormones,

449
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,819
stuff we talked about last time

450
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,589
in reference to testosterone and estrogen.

451
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,590
But MSH is released from the
medial portion of the pituitary

452
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,623
and it stimulates the desire
to not eat, to cease eating.

453
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,150
What's really interesting,

454
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,830
is that Melanocyte-stimulating hormone

455
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,140
is activated by ultraviolet light.

456
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,380
And it's not activated by
ultraviolet light to the skin

457
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,930
or directly to pituitary,

458
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,950
it's activated by ultraviolet
light to the eyes.

459
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,280
Now, if you've been watching this podcast

460
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,190
or listening to this podcast
for any period of time,

461
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,860
or you've heard me on other podcasts

462
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,700
or you follow my Instagram,

463
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,220
I am a big fan of this whole
thing of getting morning light

464
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,410
in order to synchronize
circadian rhythms, et cetera,

465
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,040
avoiding light in the middle of the night.

466
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,760
This is yet another reason

467
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,890
why getting ample light, ideally sunlight,

468
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,550
but it could be other sources
of UV light to the eyes,

469
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,710
stimulates MSH, this has been
shown over and over again.

470
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,720
And keeps the desire to
eat or appetite in check,

471
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,320
in healthy ranges.

472
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,690
This is also why in the
spring and summer months,

473
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,330
animals and people eat less.

474
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,040
Now, for hibernating
animals it's different,

475
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,090
because they bear hibernate, actually.

476
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,490
Ashley bears don't truly
hibernate technically,

477
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,880
by a scientific criteria
they don't hibernate,

478
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,610
but they go into a kind of torpor.

479
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,033
The hibernating animals
they don't eat much

480
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:48,580
because they're in boroughs or dens,

481
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,150
or they're just wrapped
up in a little ball

482
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,740
or whatever it is that
hibernating animals do.

483
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,530
So they're of course going to
eat far less in the winter.

484
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,650
But that's a unique scenario,

485
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,920
we are not hibernating animals.

486
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,520
But humans generally have greater appetite

487
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,330
in the cold winter months.

488
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,700
And it's not just because of the holidays

489
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,630
and the abundance of food

490
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,020
that we're presenting ourselves with,

491
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,080
but when we get a lot of
sun our appetite is reduced

492
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,300
or at least it's easier to control.

493
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,710
And that is due in part,

494
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,850
because if you're getting
ample sunlight to the eyes,

495
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,463
it's converted into a
signal for the MSH neurons,

496
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,420
the neurons that release MSH, excuse me

497
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,390
these PMOC neurons release MSH.

498
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,600
And then MSH can bind its receptors,

499
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,310
and can keep the break
on appetite in check.

500
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,070
So the takeaway tool from this,

501
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,390
is make sure you're getting enough light

502
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,410
not just in the morning,
but throughout the day.

503
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,190
And yes, it has to be light to your eyes.

504
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,570
And blasting your eyes with
sunlight or artificial light

505
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,260
to the point where it's
damaging or painful,

506
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,240
won't accelerate or improve this process.

507
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,870
It's about getting photons,

508
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,650
ultraviolet light to the eyes consistently

509
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,603
throughout the day.

510
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,750
That's best accomplished
by not wearing sunglasses

511
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,060
provided you can do that safely.

512
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,170
And if you don't have
access to enough sunlight,

513
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,550
then you can do this
with artificial light.

514
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,610
This also points again to our old friends,

515
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,910
the blue blockers.

516
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,850
Many people know I'm not a
huge fan of blue blockers

517
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,640
especially not during the daytime,

518
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,770
because they block a lot of the UV

519
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,470
and shorter wavelength
light that you want and need

520
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,070
to create alertness, but
also to create release of MSH

521
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,440
from the medial pituitary.

522
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,890
Now there are people out there,

523
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,400
subcultures, that actually inject MSH.

524
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,530
That are taking MSH or
things similar to it.

525
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,690
I am not suggesting people do that.

526
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,270
But there are three main
consequences of doing that.

527
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,990
First of all, it reduces
appetite, no surprise there.

528
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,310
And they're actually using
it as a dieting drug.

529
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,030
This is kind of in the underground.

530
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,430
I don't know what the legal status is.

531
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,240
And again, I'm not
promoting that people do it.

532
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Two, it makes them very, very
tan, which makes sense, right?

533
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,850
Melanocyte-stimulating hormone.

534
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,820
And the third is, it
purportedly, never tried it,

535
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,850
purportedly sends libido through the roof,

536
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,580
to the point where it's
actually distracting

537
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,320
for other activities.

538
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,260
It actually can create priapism,

539
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,420
which is a kind of
chronic erection in males

540
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,830
to the point where it actually
can be physically damaging

541
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,000
to the genitalia.

542
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,893
So this is a drug,

543
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:21,300
I don't know whether or
not it's call it a drug.

544
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a substance that one can
regulate with healthy levels,

545
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,620
with sunlight and perhaps
artificial UV light.

546
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,530
I have not heard much about
treatments for obesity

547
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,940
involving getting ample sunlight
or getting ample UV light,

548
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,760
but to me, the logic is just very clear.

549
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,060
And so if you're pursuing those avenues,

550
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,090
you certainly should
talk to your physician

551
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,160
but you might want to think about

552
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,010
how some of those logic hangs together.

553
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,340
Absolutely fascinating hormone,

554
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,350
I think most people aren't aware of it.

555
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,400
And the subcultures that are aware of it

556
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,960
are using it for two very
particular end points,

557
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,170
and they're using it at
super physiological levels.

558
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,060
That's enough about that
'cause I really don't know.

559
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,950
I've talked to a few people in research.

560
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,020
Believe it or not for this podcast,

561
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,290
I reached out to a few people

562
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,440
and asked whether or not
the these are side effects

563
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,320
in air quotes.

564
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,120
I've heard about are true,
and indeed they're true.

565
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,150
But again, that's super
physiological, controlling MSH,

566
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,300
it's actually Alpha MSH levels

567
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,020
through viewing ultraviolet light

568
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,750
seems like an interesting

569
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,840
and mechanistically logical thing to do,

570
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,050
if your goal is to keep appetite in check.

571
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,560
So MSH inhibits hunger.

572
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,780
Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide

573
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,870
that activates hunger.

574
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,020
And this is a really interesting one

575
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,930
because it relates to when you get hungry,

576
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,830
in addition to the fact
that you get hungry at all.

577
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,830
And it's called ghrelin,
it's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

578
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,610
Ghrelin is released
actually from the GI tract.

579
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,550
And its main role is to
increase your desire to eat.

580
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,040
And it does that through
a variety of mechanisms.

581
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,860
Part of that is to stimulate
some of the brain areas,

582
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,060
the actual neurons, that
make you want to eat.

583
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,050
In addition, it creates
food anticipatory signals

584
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,040
within your nervous systems.

585
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,490
So you start thinking about the things

586
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,420
that you happen to like to eat

587
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,487
at that particular time of day.

588
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,840
And this is fascinating.

589
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,690
Ghrelin is sort of like a clock,

590
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,120
a hormonal clock that
makes you want to eat

591
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,410
at particular times.

592
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,120
Now, the signal for ghrelin
is reduced glucose levels

593
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,150
in the blood.

594
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,860
We're going to talk a lot today
about glucose and insulin,

595
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,320
ways to manage glucose and insulin.

596
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,700
But for now the simple version of this,

597
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,890
is you normally want your glucose

598
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,690
to be in a kind of modest range,

599
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,910
and I'll explain what
range is in a little bit.

600
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,440
But if it drops too low, ghrelin
is secreted from your gut.

601
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,920
It activates neurons in your
brain at various locations

602
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,240
including the PMOC neurons,

603
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,840
and the other neurons of the wingin' it.

604
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,950
It also activates the
VMH in particular ways.

605
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,680
And it might even activate
some of these neurons

606
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,470
that are in the periphery in your mouth

607
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,563
that actually make you salivate
and want to eat, right?

608
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:14,340
Now, we all know about
the famous Pavlovian,

609
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,870
experiments of Pavlov's dogs.

610
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,340
You know, they start
salivating to the bell.

611
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,260
After the bell was presented
with food, you remove the food,

612
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,980
and then just the bell can
stimulate the salivation.

613
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,830
We become Pavlovian at times.

614
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,680
But rarely is it ever discussed

615
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,820
what the neural pathways for that are.

616
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,233
And it turns out that these hormones

617
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:32,590
that are secreted from the
gut can stimulate the neurons

618
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,060
to create a sensation and
a desire for certain foods

619
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,723
at certain times of day.

620
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,930
You've done this experiment.

621
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,170
If you are somebody who eats breakfast

622
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,230
at more or less the same time each day,

623
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,990
let's say 8:00 AM plus
or minus 20 minutes.

624
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,740
And then you eat lunch 12:30
plus or minus 20 minutes.

625
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,090
Or let's say you're somebody like me

626
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,350
who typically skips
breakfast, and just eats lunch

627
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,133
usually around 11:30 or
12 or something like that.

628
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,310
Your ghrelin secretion will start to match

629
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,520
when you typically eat.

630
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,640
And it does that.

631
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,480
And it's able to override
the low levels of glucose

632
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,660
in your bloodstream,

633
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,130
because the ghrelin system also gets input

634
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,340
from a clock in your liver

635
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,150
that is linked to the
clock in your hypothalamus,

636
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,983
in your brain.

637
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:24,330
And what this means is, if
you eat at regular meal times,

638
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,860
you'll start to get hungry a few minutes

639
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,970
before those meals times.

640
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,640
If you've ever wondered why

641
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,810
your stomach kind of starts to growl

642
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,657
because it's a particular time of day,

643
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,540
and you're like, Oh I must want to eat,

644
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,040
well, that's ghrelin.

645
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,730
And for those of you that don't know

646
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,440
why your stomach growls, I'll
also tell you that today.

647
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
It's actually really interesting.

648
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
It not at all what you expect,

649
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,700
and it's not just the gurgling
of liquids in your stomach.

650
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,900
That's not what it is.

651
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,820
It's actually a muscular phenomenon.

652
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,280
So, ghrelin is secreted as
a food anticipatory signal,

653
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,550
to get you motivated to
go eat at regular times.

654
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,480
So, nowadays there's a lot of interest

655
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,003
in intermittent fasting.

656
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,170
There's also a lot of interest
in just what meal plans

657
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,350
and schedules and what to eat in general,

658
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,760
in order to maximize one's
health and wellbeing.

659
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,980
And people have all
sorts of cosmetic reasons

660
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,260
and brain reasons and metabolic reasons

661
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,580
for wanting to control this kind of stuff.

662
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,180
So let's make it really simple

663
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,350
by first looking at the extremes.

664
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,090
Some people need to eat
every two or three hours.

665
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,300
They feel this, "I need to
eat every two or three hours,"

666
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,550
or else their blood sugar drops.

667
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,370
In general, blood sugar
doesn't drop so low,

668
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,870
that they truly need to eat

669
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,600
in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue.

670
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,810
Although sometimes that can happen.

671
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,480
Some people are truly
hypoglycemic, low blood sugar.

672
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,950
But most people as the blood
sugar starts to head down

673
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,610
towards the low-ish ranges,
ghrelin is secreted.

674
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,550
And so for those people
not eating on the clock,

675
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,940
it's very disruptive to them

676
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,520
because it activates these
neurons in the brain.

677
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,290
For people who eat once
a day or twice a day,

678
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,160
or tend to shift their meals,

679
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,240
you know, and they might eat a lot

680
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,010
but during a limited
so-called feeding window,

681
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,530
it's kind of interesting humans
now eat and talk about foods

682
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,460
in ways that for years I used
to hear about in classes,

683
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,120
in courses, and research
lectures about feeding animals,

684
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,680
you know, restricted feeding windows.

685
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,640
And we owe a great deal of
gratitude to Satchin Panda,

686
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,940
who was a colleague of mine
when my lab was in San Diego

687
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,860
at the Salk Institute, who
really is one of the pioneers

688
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,560
of this restricted feeding window work

689
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,720
and has done a beautiful work.

690
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,570
He has a book that's excellent
called 'The Circadian Code'

691
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,750
that I highly recommend.

692
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,620
And he's done a lot of important work

693
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,410
on neurons in the retina,
that control circadian timing,

694
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,110
but also the relationship
between feeding windows

695
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,270
and health.

696
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,270
And he's sort of among the
major proponents I should say,

697
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,110
of circadian eating, that means
eating during the daytime,

698
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,100
not at night or intermittent fasting,

699
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,330
restricting feeding windows

700
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,560
to anywhere from four
to six to eight hours.

701
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,750
I'll use myself as an example

702
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,910
of the transition from
regular feeding schedule

703
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,090
to a more intermittent-ish fasting,

704
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,210
although I don't really fall
into true intermittent fasting.

705
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,290
So I was one of these people
that just got so accustomed

706
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,320
to waking up and eating about
an hour after I woke up.

707
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
That to go from eating
every three or four hours

708
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,960
to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner,

709
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,830
maybe a couple of snacks in
the afternoon or something.

710
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,660
At first it was excruciating.

711
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,640
I remember thinking like,

712
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,830
this is really brutal pushing out feeding.

713
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,620
I didn't think I could exercise
unless I had eaten first.

714
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,480
We now know that during
most all forms of exercise

715
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,330
unless you're really focused
on optimal performance

716
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,760
like you've got to hit key lifts

717
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,940
or you have to sprint
at your maximum speed.

718
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,080
And maybe even then that you
can exercise faster just fine,

719
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,460
because you're mainly relying
on sources like glycogen

720
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,180
from the liver, some
undigested food sometimes,

721
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,890
as gross as that may seem it's true,

722
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,610
as well as body fat if the
exercise about is extremely long.

723
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,810
But what that means is
that if you suddenly go

724
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,990
from eating on a very regular
schedule to skipping a meal,

725
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,610
or pushing your meal timing
out or shifting at all,

726
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,120
you're going to have
ghrelin in your system.

727
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,700
And that ghrelin is going to
stimulate the desire to eat

728
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,430
by acting at the level of your brain.

729
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,180
And it is indeed at
that point, just mental.

730
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,730
When we hear about just
mental, just physical,

731
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,800
it's really kind of the same thing

732
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,680
'cause it's all chemicals, brain and body.

733
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,300
But it's the stimulation of
neurons that anticipate feeding.

734
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,700
You're stimulating the
arcuate nucleus neurons

735
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,290
that make you want to
eat those AgRP neurons.

736
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,940
So ghrelin stimulates the AgRP neurons,

737
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,600
which makes you want to eat.

738
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,630
So what can you do with this?

739
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,680
What this means is,

740
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,270
if you want to start shifting
your feeding schedule

741
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,560
to one where you're not
eating quite as frequently,

742
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,160
and there are some advantages to that

743
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,450
that aren't just in the
biochemistry and health related,

744
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,660
you know, cellar health related things.

745
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,200
But some of them include
not having to think about

746
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,870
or buy food, right?

747
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,840
You actually don't have to
think about food all day

748
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,470
if you're not eating so often.

749
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,590
The other is, it gives you

750
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,470
a far more social flexibility, right?

751
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,780
You can go to a noon
meeting if you have to

752
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,077
or you can go out to dinner
at a particular time.

753
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:06,560
And you know, I guess it
makes it kind of tough

754
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,100
if you want to meet
somebody for breakfast,

755
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,410
'cause then you're the dork

756
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,770
who's just like sipping black coffee

757
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,840
and like refusing everything.

758
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,460
But anyway, I've been that dork.

759
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,360
So it's one of those things
you just kind of work with.

760
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,000
But the fact of the matter
is, ghrelin secretion,

761
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,160
because of its relationship
to the nervous system,

762
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,000
can be shifted by about
45 minutes per day.

763
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,130
Now, it's going to vary.

764
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,200
Some of you have more
so-called willpower, you know.

765
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,460
But if you really want to just start

766
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,300
pushing that first meal out
or shifting in any direction,

767
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,960
some people might want to eat
in the early part of the day

768
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,070
and not in the evening.

769
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,670
Trying to shift the
mealtimes out the spacing

770
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,630
by about 45 minutes, is
what the neural circuits

771
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,150
that link the ghrelin system
to the neural circuits

772
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,140
that control feeding, really can handle

773
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,250
because it's a form of neuroplasticity.

774
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,490
And so what this would look like is,

775
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,650
if you normally you eat
breakfast at eight o'clock

776
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,300
plus or minus 20 minutes,

777
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,670
and you want to start eating
your first meal at noon

778
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,280
you would take maybe four or five days

779
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,510
and just start pushing the meal out

780
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,780
by about 45 minutes to an hour each day.

781
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,610
So it's not quite as painful.

782
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,460
Or you can just take the plunge
and just do it all at once.

783
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,160
I have a colleague who was
a neurosurgeon at Stanford,

784
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,100
came up through my lab,
he's now at Neuralink,

785
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,170
and he has a great practice.

786
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,430
He keeps his ghrelin system at random.

787
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,790
What he does is he skips one meal per day

788
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,240
and he makes his external
schedule dictate that.

789
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,340
So, sometimes he skips breakfast,
sometimes he skips lunch,

790
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,173
sometimes he skips dinner,

791
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:33,880
he just skips one of the
three major meals per day.

792
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,450
And in doing that, the ghrelin system

793
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,760
has always kind of kept off kilter.

794
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,240
And it probably also allows him

795
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,050
to have a lot of neural flexibility,

796
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,420
what we call top-down control.

797
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,770
Just the knowledge, Oh, you
know the hunger I'm feeling

798
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,210
isn't necessarily hypoglycemia.

799
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,460
And in his case, it's
almost certainly not.

800
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,690
And therefore what I'm feeling here

801
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,230
is an activation of these AgRP neurons,

802
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,410
and therefore I can push
my meal schedule around

803
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,680
however I want.

804
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,430
Now, I should mention that
top-down mechanisms are powerful.

805
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,120
Belief, motivation,

806
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,020
these things can really
shift neural circuits.

807
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,600
We're going to talk more
about that a little bit later.

808
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,340
But there are also people who
are genuinely hypoglycemic

809
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,750
and they need to take really good control

810
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,010
of their blood sugar levels
and try and keep them stable.

811
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,880
And so of course, you want to do

812
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,230
what's medically safe for you.

813
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,690
I'm not at all recommending

814
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,530
that people that suffer from hypoglycemia

815
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,890
suddenly disrupt their
blood sugar patterns

816
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,520
in any direction, that
wouldn't be healthy.

817
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,580
But for most people out there

818
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,780
who have reasonable blood glucose levels,

819
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,320
it's kind of interesting and kind of fun

820
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,780
to play with these parameters

821
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,640
in order to optimize what you want to do.

822
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,420
And sometimes that might
change across the year

823
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,300
with schedules.

824
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,380
Many find great benefit
in having flexibility

825
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,620
over when they eat.

826
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,080
Regularity of eating equals
regularity of ghrelin secretion

827
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,120
equals regularity of activity
of these AgRP neurons,

828
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,250
meaning you'll be hungry
at very regular intervals.

829
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,530
So that's something
that you can work with,

830
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,500
it's grounded in deep mechanism

831
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,680
of hormone and neural systems,

832
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,430
and there's a lot of modern research

833
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,220
to support what I just said.

834
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,490
So, if MSH inhibits feeding,
makes us want to eat less

835
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,170
and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,

836
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:14,710
there's another hormone
called CCK, Cholecystokinin,

837
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,510
that is potent in reducing
our levels of hunger.

838
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,340
Now, I learned about CCK back
when I was an undergraduate.

839
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,340
So, well over 20 years ago,
when it was first discovered.

840
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,480
And there was a lot of excitement
about CCK at that point

841
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,230
as a diet drug.

842
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,410
You know, anytime there's a molecule

843
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,620
or a chemical discovered
in the brain or body

844
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,950
that can suppress feeding, the
diet industry just goes wild

845
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,240
and they think, this is
going to be the thing

846
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,340
that's going to allow people
to move from being obese

847
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,860
to losing all sorts of
unhealthy weight, et cetera.

848
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,740
A similar phenomenon was
observed with leptin.

849
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,630
Leptin is a hormone
that's made by body fat

850
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,880
that signals to the brain when
there's a lot of body fat,

851
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,130
and in animals injections of leptin

852
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,900
can make fat animals thin.

853
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,850
They lose a lot of adipose or fat.

854
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,040
In humans, it didn't work out that way.

855
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,639
It just the studies were done
and leptin was successful

856
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,609
in treating a certain
rare form of diabetes,

857
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,380
but it really wasn't very
potent as an anti-obesity drug.

858
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,380
Similarly, CCK has been
looked at as an obesity drug,

859
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,560
something to reduce obesity.

860
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,159
But it had some pretty
unhappy side effects

861
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,439
actually caused some pretty
serious side effects.

862
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,340
Now that's as drug.

863
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,340
However, CCK when released
at normal levels by your gut

864
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,840
has a powerful effect

865
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,570
in suppressing appetite
for a period of time.

866
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,429
And there are healthy and
direct ways to activate CCK.

867
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,099
Now, CCK is in the GI tract,

868
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,949
it's released from the GI tract.

869
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:56,679
And it's release is
governed by two things.

870
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,970
One is a subset of very
specialized neurons

871
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,690
that detect what's in the gut,

872
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,280
the specific contents of the gut.

873
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,340
And by certain elements of the mucosa,

874
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,270
of the mucus lining of the
gut and the gut microbiome.

875
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,410
So what's really interesting,

876
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:18,410
is that CCK is stimulated by fatty acids

877
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,810
and particular fatty acids
that we'll talk about.

878
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,330
Amino acids, and particular amino acids

879
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,950
that we'll talk about,
as well as by sugar.

880
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,090
Now, let's put sugar on
the shelf for a moment.

881
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,720
We're going to talk a lot about sugar

882
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,630
because if CCK inhibits
appetite and reduces feeding,

883
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,200
and it can be triggered by
fatty acids, amino acids,

884
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,880
or sugars, then you might say,

885
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,450
well, then in eating a lot of sugars

886
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,270
should make us not want to eat more,

887
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,230
but we all know that eating sugar

888
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,150
makes us want to eat far more.

889
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,030
That's the role of a lot of sugars.

890
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,770
And that has to do with
a separate mechanism

891
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,550
we'll talk about today.

892
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,160
So, which fatty acids in the gut

893
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
stimulate the release of CCK?

894
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,790
It turns out it's the omega-3 fatty acids,

895
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,200
the ones that come from
algae or krill or fish oil.

896
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,870
I talked about this in
the episode on nutrition

897
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,790
and some of the things
related to the gut microbiome.

898
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,340
And I'm going to revisit that now.

899
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,410
Omega-3 fatty acids and
Conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,

900
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,440
either from food or from supplements,

901
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,560
stimulate the release of CCK

902
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,810
which then reduces, or
at least blunts appetite.

903
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,650
And I'm not talking
about blunting appetite

904
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,950
to anorexic levels where you
don't want to eat at all.

905
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm talking about regulating appetite

906
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,640
to the point where animals
and people don't over-consume.

907
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,003
So it's keeping appetite
at a healthy level.

908
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,750
The other thing that stimulates
CCK that I mentioned,

909
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,220
are amino acids.

910
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,410
So when we eat, we have
the ability to break down

911
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,510
different macronutrients,
you know, carbohydrates, fats

912
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,110
or proteins, into sugars and glucose,

913
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,197
that then we can convert to ATP

914
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:01,460
and all that stuff from a
Krebs cycle from high school.

915
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,530
We're not going to go into that today,

916
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,180
that's for a future episode.

917
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,450
But amino acids are one of the things

918
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,150
that we are eating for.

919
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,770
Amino acids both can be used as energy

920
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,190
through a process called gluconeogenesis,

921
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,410
of converting proteins into energy.

922
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,870
Or those amino acids can be broken down

923
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,990
and then rebuilt into things
like preparing, excuse me,

924
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,210
repairing muscle tissue

925
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,470
as well as other forms of cellar repair.

926
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,530
They're involved in all sorts of things

927
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,680
related to protein synthesis.

928
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
What does this mean?

929
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,140
If we eat the proper amino
acids at the proper levels,

930
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,790
if we ingest omega-3's and
CLA's, Conjugated linoleic acids

931
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,570
at the proper levels, or
get them from supplements,

932
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,430
there's a blunting of appetite.

933
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,520
Appetite is kept clamped and
we don't become hyperphagic.

934
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,600
We don't overeat.

935
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,640
We tend to eat within
healthy or normal ranges.

936
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,680
So this is very important,

937
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,550
because most people don't
understand that when we're eating,

938
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,050
we are basically fat foraging
and amino acid foraging.

939
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,630
And there are several
studies now have shown,

940
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,190
that people and animals
will essentially eat

941
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,680
until they feel they've
consumed enough omega-3's,

942
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,670
omega-6's, CLA's, and certain amino acids.

943
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,580
In other words, even
if it's not conscious,

944
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,820
we are eating until we
trigger the activation of CCK.

945
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,950
Now, there are other reasons
why we shut down eating too.

946
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,080
Are literally, the volume of
food in our gut can be large,

947
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,030
and we can feel very distended.

948
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,450
That's the physical reason obviously.

949
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,870
There are other reasons,

950
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,040
maybe we just have top-down control.

951
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,000
We have knowledge that
this is the end of the meal

952
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,380
and we stop 'cause we
have to go back to work

953
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,520
or to a meeting, or we tell
ourselves we've had enough.

954
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,090
But at a subconscious level,

955
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,190
the gut is informing the brain
via CCK and other mechanisms

956
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,480
when we've ingested
enough of what we need.

957
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,410
And these omega-3's and
CLA's and certain amino acids

958
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:01,840
are vital for sending out that
signal that we've had enough.

959
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,640
Now, which amino acids is
actually really interesting?

960
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,910
We have essential amino acids

961
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,020
and we have non-essential amino acids.

962
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,400
Among the essential amino acids,

963
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,680
there's one in particular

964
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,760
that can trigger the release
of CCK very potently,

965
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,923
and that's glutamine.

966
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,260
Glutamine is a very
interesting amino acid.

967
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,260
First of all, it's been
shown in a few studies

968
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,370
to play a role in bolstering
the immune system.

969
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,380
It can increase the number of killer cells

970
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,430
in the immune system.

971
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,370
It is consumed but in supplement form.

972
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,300
You know, people can take it.

973
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,560
You know, a teaspoon of glutamine

974
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,780
or some people take
glutamine throughout the day,

975
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,020
if they're really into it
or for whatever reason,

976
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,580
they think they're
battling off an infection

977
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,110
or something of that sort.

978
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,610
Glutamine can also of course
be derived from foods.

979
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,980
And you can just put into the Internet,

980
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,840
do an Internet search

981
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,780
and find out what foods
are rich with glutamine.

982
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,180
Some of the ones that I'm
aware of off the top of my head

983
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,240
are like cottage cheese,
and things of that sort.

984
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,190
But other foods have glutamine as well.

985
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,140
Once a threshold level of glutamine

986
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,460
and other essential
amino acids are reached,

987
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,010
once the threshold level of
these Alpha-3, excuse me,

988
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,250
Omega-3 fatty acids and CLA's
are reached, CCK is released,

989
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,690
and it helps reduce the activity

990
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,950
of those AgRP neurons
that promote feeding.

991
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,900
So as you can see, feeding is an interplay

992
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,470
between brain and body.

993
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,140
And it's some of the micronutrients

994
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,210
and even the breakdown
of particular nutrients,

995
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,160
that's putting the accelerator

996
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,070
or the brake on the feeding process.

997
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,730
It's not just one thing.

998
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,663
So from an actionable standpoint,

999
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,270
you, we should probably all
be trying to get our omega-3,

1000
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,500
Omega-6 ratios correct anyway,

1001
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,220
because they are antidepressant.

1002
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,750
I talked about the peer
reviewed studies on that.

1003
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,070
They are healthy for the gut microbiome,

1004
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,460
and we should be seeking
sufficient glutamine.

1005
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,500
Now, whether or not you decide

1006
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,000
to supplement with glutamine
or not, is up to you.

1007
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,080
One of the reasons why
one might want to do that,

1008
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,880
and again, you should
always check with a doctor,

1009
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,310
especially if you have any
predisposition to cancers

1010
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,660
or you have cancer, many cancers
and tumors like glutamine,

1011
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,020
so that's something to note.

1012
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,450
But one reason why you might
want to supplement with glutamine

1013
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,690
or consider eating foods
that are rich in glutamine,

1014
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,760
isn't just to keep your
appetite in healthy ranges,

1015
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,540
but as well, glutamine can
actually reduce sugar cravings.

1016
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,000
So this is very interesting.

1017
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,010
I have a friend, he's an absolute
chocolate, sweets addict.

1018
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,740
He's a grown adult, but he
eats candy and chocolate

1019
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:29,860
as if he was like a 14 year old kid

1020
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,640
hanging out at the
local convenience store.

1021
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,330
It's really incredible.

1022
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,980
And he has probably a sugar addiction,

1023
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,110
but he's very aware of this

1024
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,430
and he's managed to kick
all other addictions.

1025
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,440
So, for whatever reason, it
stimulates his brain and body

1026
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,940
in the ways that make him
want more, but he hates this.

1027
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,950
It's actually quite frustrating for him.

1028
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,220
He's somebody who cares
a lot about his health.

1029
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,440
He took the approach that I
know many other people have

1030
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,220
who know about this role of glutamine,

1031
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,090
of taking a teaspoon

1032
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,800
or a couple of teaspoons of glutamine

1033
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,650
several times throughout the
day or anytime he craves sugar.

1034
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,000
And indeed, glutamine, well,
reduced sugar cravings.

1035
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,580
Some people who are really on
the kind of ketogenic front,

1036
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,150
will mix it with a little
bit of half and half

1037
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,983
and down that,

1038
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:13,090
and because I guess it
makes it taste better,

1039
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,350
it's a little bit chalky.

1040
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,840
So, glutamine has some very
interesting properties.

1041
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,960
But I think for most people

1042
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,933
that aren't suffering from
adverse levels of craving,

1043
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,470
making sure you're getting
the right omega-3's

1044
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,510
that can come from a variety of sources,

1045
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,580
check out the episode we did on nutrition

1046
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,260
if you want to learn more about that.

1047
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,840
And CLA's, and making sure

1048
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,070
that you're getting enough glutamine

1049
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,480
is going to be important for making sure

1050
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,260
that the CCK signal gets through.

1051
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,150
The one thing I do want to
mention about glutamine,

1052
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,930
it's a minor effect, but it
alone can have a small increase,

1053
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,220
excuse me, it alone can
increase blood sugar.

1054
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,400
It's not a huge increase in blood glucose.

1055
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,590
But because the gut takes proteins

1056
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,467
and breaks them down
into these amino acids,

1057
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,500
and essentially looking for
glutamine and things like it,

1058
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,303
other essential amino acids as well.

1059
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,980
When you ingest glutamine
or branch chain amino acids,

1060
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,850
there is a small but real
increase in blood glucose.

1061
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,350
And that's because they
are essentially food.

1062
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,430
And there I'm talking about
the supplemental version.

1063
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,690
So, just know glutamine can
increase blood sugar slightly,

1064
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,430
especially diabetics should know that.

1065
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,550
It can reduce sugar cravings.

1066
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,100
And just know that what your
gut is doing at a core level

1067
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,620
is it's forging, it's waiting,

1068
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,680
and it's trying to assess
levels of omega-3 fatty acid,

1069
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,490
conjugated linoleic acid,

1070
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,390
and glutamine, and other
essential amino acids.

1071
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,060
You are essentially trying
to eat to get these nutrients

1072
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,390
and then a signal can be
deployed up to your brain,

1073
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,940
that you're not really interested
in eating that much more.

1074
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,100
Whenever preparing an
episode for this podcast

1075
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,310
I'm always faced with
a particular challenge,

1076
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,480
which is, how many tools should I offer

1077
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,640
that involve doing something new?

1078
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,590
You know, a new behavior,
a new exercise, supplement,

1079
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,890
something, things of that sort.

1080
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,890
And how many should be
related to not doing things,

1081
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,723
avoiding things.

1082
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:00,980
It's never really fun to talk about

1083
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,610
all the things that
we're supposed to avoid,

1084
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,810
but some of them are so powerful

1085
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,170
in light of the mechanisms
of a given topic

1086
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,020
that I'd be remiss if
I didn't mention them.

1087
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,600
So now you understand how hormones,

1088
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,843
and peptides like CCK and
ghrelin impact appetite.

1089
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:20,640
There's one particular aspect of food

1090
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,800
that can powerfully impact CCK.

1091
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,380
And I think most people,

1092
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,540
I'm guessing 99.9% of people out there

1093
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,370
are not aware of this.

1094
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,990
And it has to do with
highly processed foods.

1095
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,040
There's a lot of reasons

1096
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,010
why one would want to avoid
highly processed foods.

1097
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,600
In fact, if you're
interested in that topic

1098
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,900
and the history of whole foods,

1099
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,930
transitioning to highly
processed foods in this country,

1100
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,820
I highly recommend you
listen to a YouTube video

1101
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,500
by Dr. Robert Lustig,

1102
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,550
he's at university of
California, San Francisco.

1103
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,520
It's very easy to find, put
Stanford, Robert Lustig,

1104
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,430
it was a talk hosted by Stanford.

1105
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,580
Gives a a beautiful description
of the history of this,

1106
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,190
and why the food industry
started packing in

1107
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,830
additional sugars and salts,

1108
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,480
and turning foods into commodities,
it's really fascinating.

1109
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,600
It has no conspiracy theory
is just all scientific facts.

1110
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,750
It's really a wonderful lecture.

1111
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,400
It has millions of views, it
should be very easy to find.

1112
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,550
We can provide a link
to that, and we will.

1113
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,350
There's another reason

1114
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,240
to avoid highly processed foods however,

1115
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,050
and that has to do with
what's called emulsifiers.

1116
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:23,990
Now, many of you are
familiar with emulsifiers,

1117
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,250
even though you don't know it.

1118
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,247
When you put detergent in the laundry

1119
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:32,360
that contains emulsifiers,
the goal of that detergent

1120
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,997
is to bring together fatty
molecules with water molecules

1121
00:45:35,997 --> 00:45:38,470
and be able to dissociate
them and break them up

1122
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,320
to get the stains out of
clothes and things of that sort.

1123
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,480
There are a lot of emulsifiers
put into processed foods.

1124
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,790
And those emulsifiers allow
certain chemical reactions

1125
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,160
to occur that extends the
shelf life of those foods.

1126
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,610
So it's like candy bars and cereals,

1127
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,560
and all sorts of things
that are in processed foods.

1128
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,370
The worst of which are the
typical kind of pastries

1129
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,570
that you see at the convenience store.

1130
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,550
But this extends into
chips of various kinds

1131
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,410
and even some meats of various kinds,

1132
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,740
they pack this stuff into meats.

1133
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,580
They have names like soy
lecithin and other things.

1134
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,490
Why are emulsifiers bad?

1135
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:14,040
Okay, there are a lot of
reasons why they're bad,

1136
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,460
but the reason why they're bad

1137
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,050
for the mechanisms that we've
been talking about today,

1138
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,410
is that when you ingest those foods,

1139
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,090
you're bringing those
emulsifiers into your gut.

1140
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,140
And those emulsifiers strip away

1141
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,260
the mucosal lining of the gut,

1142
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,580
and they actually cause the
neurons that innervate the gut,

1143
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,100
that extend those little processes

1144
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,650
we call axons into the gut, to
retract deeper into the gut.

1145
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,830
And as a consequence, you're
ingesting a bunch of food

1146
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,950
and the signals like
CCK never get deployed.

1147
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,250
The signals that actually shut down hunger

1148
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,690
are never actually triggered.

1149
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,990
And so, as a consequence
you want to eat far more

1150
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,710
of these highly processed foods.

1151
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,620
In addition, if you then go

1152
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,030
from eating a highly processed food

1153
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,460
to non highly processed foods,

1154
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,260
you're not able to measure
the amounts of amino acids,

1155
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,480
sugars, and fatty acids in
those foods as accurately.

1156
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,810
You've actually done structural
damage at a micro level,

1157
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,200
but structural level damage, excuse me,

1158
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,860
to the mucosal lining of the gut.

1159
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,190
Now, this can all be repaired

1160
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,030
if you stay away from
highly processed foods

1161
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,300
for some period of time.

1162
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,530
But the negative effects
of these emulsifiers

1163
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,770
are quite real.

1164
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,373
So, to make it really clean and simple,

1165
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,730
emulsifiers from highly processed foods

1166
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,670
are limiting your guts ability

1167
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,450
to detect what's in the foods you eat

1168
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,850
and therefore to deploy
the satiety signals,

1169
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,730
the signals that shut down hunger.

1170
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,720
In addition to that, there's
a parallel mechanism at play,

1171
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,570
that I talked about in a previous episode

1172
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:41,410
but I'll remind you again, that
you have neurons in your gut

1173
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,660
that are sensing sugar,

1174
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,780
and are sending a subconscious
signal up to the brain

1175
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,423
via the vagus nerve.

1176
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,360
And those neurons trigger
the release of dopamine,

1177
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,150
which makes you crave more of that food.

1178
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,370
So now you've got parallel signals

1179
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,270
making you want to eat more sugar,

1180
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,450
making you unaware of how
much sugar you've eaten,

1181
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,610
and that are disrupting the
inputs to the nervous system

1182
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,390
that signal to the rest
of your brain and body

1183
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,460
that you've obtained enough fatty acids

1184
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,990
and you've obtained enough amino acids.

1185
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,040
So these highly processed
foods are really terrible.

1186
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,910
And you know, I'm not out here to say,

1187
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,580
you know, never enjoy a
processed food of any kind,

1188
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,880
I'd be a hypocrite 'cause
I do eat processed foods

1189
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,713
from time to time.

1190
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:23,160
Although the ones that I tend to eat,

1191
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,800
I try and make of the healthier variety.

1192
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,880
But eating whole foods
has tremendous value

1193
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,740
and eating highly processed food

1194
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,890
has tremendous negative impact on the gut

1195
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,540
and on the gut brain axis.

1196
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,410
And so, recently there
was a paper that came out

1197
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,740
in Cell, Cell Press journal,

1198
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,660
it's kind of the apex of Cell journals,

1199
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,010
which is a phenomenal.

1200
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,620
This paper showed that,
ingesting highly processed food

1201
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:49,440
leads to more intake of not
just highly processed foods

1202
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,870
but other types of food in general.

1203
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,120
There was kind of an
overeating compensation

1204
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,760
generally across foods

1205
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,730
for people that consume
these highly processed foods.

1206
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,900
And there are a lot of other reasons

1207
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,460
to avoid highly processed foods.

1208
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,970
So again, I don't like to
focus too much on the do nots,

1209
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,360
I like to arm you with tools to do.

1210
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,837
But I think this visual of certain foods

1211
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:10,200
and these emulsifiers
actually stripping away

1212
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,570
some of the critical lining of your gut

1213
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,680
and disrupting the hormone
signaling to the brain

1214
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,260
controlling feeding, is important
enough and cryptic enough,

1215
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,060
meaning it hasn't been talked about,

1216
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,130
it works at a subconscious level,

1217
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,010
and that it's important
that people are aware of it

1218
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,940
so they can make decisions
about what they do want to eat

1219
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,940
or not want to eat for themselves.

1220
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,020
Before moving on, I just
want to say one more thing

1221
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,270
about highly processed foods.

1222
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,840
There was an absolutely beautiful study

1223
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,270
done by my colleague,
Chris Gardner at Stanford,

1224
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,420
exploring whether or not

1225
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,210
certain diets were better than others.

1226
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:45,910
They looked at vegan,
vegetarian, omnivore,

1227
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,870
I don't know if they
looked at all meat or not,

1228
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,380
but they looked at the
different forms of diets,

1229
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,840
intermittent fasting, et cetera.

1230
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,370
And they essentially found that,

1231
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,760
whichever diet people adhered to,

1232
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,150
whichever one they followed,
was equivalent to the others.

1233
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,400
Provided that they followed it,

1234
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,480
they lost the equivalent amount of weight.

1235
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,310
There really wasn't a strong
effect of the food type

1236
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,280
or the pattern of eating, et cetera.

1237
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,537
However, in a study like that,

1238
00:50:09,537 --> 00:50:12,780
adherence is very high because
people are a part of a study.

1239
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,440
And for many people,

1240
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,180
the ability to adhere
to a certain eating plan

1241
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,460
is one of the most, if not
the most powerful determinants

1242
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,150
of whether or not a given diet

1243
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,570
meaning nutritional plan works.

1244
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,420
Now, this thing about highly
processed foods however,

1245
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,890
is really diabolical.

1246
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,210
Because it truly says,

1247
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:35,050
and I think the recent
data in cell metabolism

1248
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:37,110
and other journals really proves that,

1249
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,580
a calorie is not a calorie.

1250
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,897
That's absolutely absurd
because of these emulsifiers

1251
00:50:40,897 --> 00:50:44,350
and the contents of these
highly processed foods.

1252
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,870
In fact, the data in
humans points to this.

1253
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,810
So what they did is they
took in-patient adults,

1254
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,040
so they had total control
over their food intake.

1255
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,220
And they received either ultra processed

1256
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,450
or unprocessed diets for
14 days, as a short study.

1257
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,260
The diets were matched
for calories, sugar,

1258
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,230
fat, fiber, and macronutrients.

1259
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,220
So everything else was matched.

1260
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,780
Just processed or non-processed
is the major variable.

1261
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,820
And basically what they found,

1262
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,630
is that the people who are
eating the processed food diet

1263
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,880
happened to eat much more, right?

1264
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,370
This was after this period of
putting them on either diet

1265
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,310
and clamping for all other variables.

1266
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,080
Then they would eat much more,

1267
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,180
and the body weight
changes were much more.

1268
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,510
And those body weight changes,

1269
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,070
were such that they
couldn't be accounted for

1270
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,690
by just increased calories.

1271
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,720
So, the bottom line is
that highly processed foods

1272
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,600
are just bad for you.

1273
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,960
They increase weight gain.

1274
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,740
They disrupt the lining of your gut

1275
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,010
in a way that disrupts things like CCK

1276
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,720
and proper satiety signals.

1277
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,210
And they contain a bunch of
things, in particular sugars,

1278
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,650
but other things as well,

1279
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,030
that disrupt not just the hormonal systems

1280
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,510
but also the neural systems
that control the desire to eat

1281
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,170
after the diet is done.

1282
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,590
So there's just so many reasons

1283
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,600
why these highly processed
foods are terrible,

1284
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,870
and they can explain a lot
of the ill health effects

1285
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,900
that we've seen in the last 50 years

1286
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,810
not just in the United States,
but all over the world.

1287
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:09,193
That enormous increase in
diabetes, juvenile diabetes.

1288
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,780
It's just remarkable

1289
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,130
how far down the path of diet we've gone.

1290
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:17,450
And it's clear, it's almost a smoking gun

1291
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,590
what the cause of this is.

1292
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,390
If you'd like to learn more about that

1293
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,270
please refer to the Lustig lecture.

1294
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,120
He also spells out why non-processed foods

1295
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,050
is far more economical in terms of

1296
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,060
just at the level of the
household or individual

1297
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,840
as well as at the societal level.

1298
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,850
Really interesting stuff,

1299
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,550
I highly recommend you check it out.

1300
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,480
So now let's move on
to some other hormones

1301
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,220
that regulate hunger and
satiety, in particular insulin.

1302
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,180
Now, you've probably
heard of insulin before.

1303
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,570
Insulin is the thing that's
lacking in type I diabetics,

1304
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,770
that's why they have to inject
insulin whenever they eat.

1305
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,340
The reason they have to do
that, is because when they eat

1306
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,840
their foods are broken down into glucose.

1307
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,630
And in order to shuttle glucose

1308
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,690
to the appropriate tissues in the body,

1309
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:03,420
and also to keep glucose levels
in check, you need insulin.

1310
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,950
So the simplest way to think
about insulin and glucose

1311
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,193
is that when you eat, that food
is broken down into sugars,

1312
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,400
that's true whether or not
it's fats or it's sugars,

1313
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,900
or eventually if it's proteins,

1314
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,333
they are oxidized into fuels as we say.

1315
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,480
And those fuels can be used

1316
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,630
as the name fuel implies into energy,

1317
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,320
they're eventually made into ATP.

1318
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,556
There's a bunch of biochemical steps there

1319
00:53:28,556 --> 00:53:29,870
we're not going to go into today,

1320
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,860
but that's essentially how it works.

1321
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,850
You break down food into glucose.

1322
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,980
Now, if you're ketogenic,

1323
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,110
we'll talk about that in a little bit.

1324
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:40,463
But in general, you eat,
food is turned into glucose.

1325
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:44,400
Your blood sugar needs to be
kept in a particular range.

1326
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,580
Hypoglycemic means too low,
hyperglycemic means too high.

1327
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,550
And what they called
euglycemic E-U, glycemic,

1328
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,053
is the healthy range.

1329
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,253
Now, what those healthy ranges are,

1330
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,180
in general the healthy
range, the euglycemic range,

1331
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,410
is about 70 to a hundred
nanograms per deciliter.

1332
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,640
But most of you aren't walking around

1333
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,950
with a glucose monitor.

1334
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,000
Some of you are, but most of you are not.

1335
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,520
The more important question
for us to address right now,

1336
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,960
is why is it important

1337
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,060
that glucose be kept
at a particular level?

1338
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,020
Once you understand that,
keeping glucose in check

1339
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,250
starts to have a rationale behind it

1340
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:27,370
and the ways to do that start
to make a lot more sense.

1341
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:32,370
So the reason is, if
glucose levels get too high

1342
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,960
because of the way that our
cells in particular neurons,

1343
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,693
interact with glucose,

1344
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,700
high levels of glucose can damage neurons.

1345
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,570
It can actually kill them.

1346
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,050
You can start getting what
are called peripheral,

1347
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,680
excuse me, neuropathies.

1348
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,150
One of the symptoms of
some forms of diabetes

1349
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,650
is that people start losing
the sensation of touch

1350
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,090
in their fingers or their
hands or their feet,

1351
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,610
and they can start going blind.

1352
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,670
There's diabetic retinopathies.

1353
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,610
So it's very important,

1354
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,640
that insulin manage your glucose levels.

1355
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,710
Now, there's also type II diabetes

1356
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:10,940
where there's insulin
secreted from the pancreas,

1357
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,540
but people are insulin insensitive.

1358
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,730
There's a disruption in the receptors

1359
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,110
and insulin insensitivity
isn't quite the same

1360
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,800
as having no insulin at all,

1361
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,940
but it parallels some
of the same mechanisms.

1362
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,080
Now, type I diabetes is often picked up

1363
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,560
because someone has a sudden weight loss,

1364
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,420
because they're not processing blood sugar

1365
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,630
the same way they were before.

1366
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,610
Type II diabetes is often,

1367
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,430
although not always associated
with being overweight

1368
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,990
and with obesity.

1369
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,870
Both of them are challenging conditions.

1370
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,480
Type II diabetes almost
always can be managed

1371
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,623
by managing one's weight.

1372
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,820
And of course there are
prescription drugs and supplements

1373
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,910
that can help manage those.

1374
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,670
We're going to talk about all of that.

1375
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,240
But for most people that
don't have diabetes,

1376
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,130
the important thing is to manage glucose,

1377
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,240
to keep it in that euglycemic range.

1378
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,490
And there are a number of
different ways to do that.

1379
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,910
Some of them are behavioral,
some of them are diet based,

1380
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,810
and some of them are based on supplements

1381
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,730
or prescription drugs.

1382
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,200
So let's talk about those now.

1383
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,970
So if you eat, and in particular
if you eat carbohydrates,

1384
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,350
blood glucose goes up.

1385
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,660
If you eat fats, blood glucose
goes up to a far less degree.

1386
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,960
And if you eat proteins,
depending on the protein,

1387
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,150
it will eventually be broken down for fuel

1388
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,430
or assembled into amino acid
chains for protein synthesis

1389
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,640
and repair of other tissues
and bodily functions.

1390
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,503
But glucose goes up and
then is kept in range.

1391
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:40,740
When you are hungry, you
secrete a different hormone

1392
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,480
and that's called glucagon.

1393
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,480
And glucagon's main role,
is to pull stores of energy

1394
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,870
out of the liver and the muscles.

1395
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,860
And once those are depleted,

1396
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,730
you'll eventually tap into body fat, okay?

1397
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,780
So, and this is for people

1398
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,550
that have a typical blood glucose range,

1399
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,120
so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range.

1400
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,360
So, the two kind of push and pull systems

1401
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,520
that we're going to think
about now to keep this simple,

1402
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,360
is that you have the insulin
system managing glucose,

1403
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,670
and you've got the glucagon system

1404
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,720
pulling energy out of
your liver and muscles

1405
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,240
for immediate fuel.

1406
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,500
And eventually you'll
pull fuel out of body fat

1407
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,230
if you've been active for a very long time

1408
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:26,500
and all your glycogen stores are depleted

1409
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,380
or close to depleted.

1410
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,000
So what does this all mean?

1411
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,290
There's a lot of important biochemistry

1412
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,430
and a lot of important cellar processes

1413
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,180
involved in whether or not
your anabolic or catabolic.

1414
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,450
Whether or not you're breaking things down

1415
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,550
or building things up.

1416
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,380
Let's talk about feeding
in a simpler way, however.

1417
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,590
And let's weave the tools
to manage blood glucose,

1418
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,270
to keep it in check, as we do that.

1419
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,320
So, let's say you had a meal

1420
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,253
and that meal consisted
of rice, a carbohydrate,

1421
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,750
some meat or fish, let's
say a piece of salmon,

1422
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,880
and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable

1423
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,330
like asparagus or cabbage
or something like that.

1424
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,050
If you were to eat all of that at once,

1425
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,960
you know, you take a bite
of one, a bite of the other,

1426
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,930
you're going to mix it up.

1427
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:13,830
You know, one of these, it
all ends up in the same place

1428
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:16,010
kind of people, mix it all up.

1429
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,550
Then you'll experience
an increase in insulin

1430
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,490
and increase in blood glucose

1431
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,420
that's moderately fast.

1432
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,800
It's going to increase pretty quickly.

1433
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,633
What's remarkable,

1434
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:29,760
is that the order that you
consume each macro-nutrient

1435
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,940
has a pretty profound influence
on the rate of insulin

1436
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,650
and glucose secretion into the blood

1437
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,030
and how quickly those levels rise.

1438
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,180
So if you will make it really simple.

1439
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,560
If you were to eat the rice first,

1440
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,960
your glucose would rise in a sharp spike,

1441
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,710
especially if it doesn't contain any fats

1442
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,600
to slow the absorption.

1443
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,400
Now, that might be good
if you're very hungry

1444
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,930
and you want to get an
increase in glucose.

1445
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:54,910
In fact, this is the reason

1446
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:58,690
why you're often served bread
before meals, because it is...

1447
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,090
And sometimes it's bread and butter,

1448
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,800
or chips before meals or appetizers,

1449
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,160
are designed to get your
blood glucose going up high

1450
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,960
because big steep
increases in blood glucose

1451
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:12,280
tend to promote the desire
to consume more glucose.

1452
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,280
And this also relates
to the dopamine system

1453
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,110
and the way that something
tasty in the mouth

1454
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,770
and sugar in the gut and
fats and sugars in the mouth,

1455
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:23,800
trigger the activation of a
lot of systems in the brain

1456
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,420
and body to consume more
of whatever you have

1457
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,570
or whatever is available to you.

1458
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:33,173
So, the basic idea is
that eating carbohydrates

1459
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:35,070
and/or fats early in a meal

1460
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,343
will give a steep rise in blood glucose.

1461
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,000
However, if you were to eat
the fibrous thing first,

1462
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,550
so a lot of chewing, but not
a big rise in blood glucose

1463
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,460
because in general there's...

1464
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,660
Unless it's laid in with sugar.

1465
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,910
Or something we're just talking about

1466
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,680
some vegetable, fibrous vegetable,

1467
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,680
that will actually blunt
the release of glucose

1468
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,330
until you eat the fish and the rice.

1469
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,340
But believe it or not

1470
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,290
it will actually blunt
the glucose increase

1471
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,020
that the rice would cause.

1472
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,853
Now, I'm not talking about

1473
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:05,830
neurotically eating each macro-nutrient

1474
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:06,700
separately in sequence.

1475
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,920
I'm just trying to give you a picture

1476
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,980
of what's happening ordinarily.

1477
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,320
So what this means is,

1478
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,930
if you feel a lot of food related anxiety,

1479
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:16,530
or you feel you're one of these people

1480
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,580
that you can kind of sense

1481
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,110
like your blood sugar
increasing very quickly,

1482
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,150
a lot of people can sense
this, some people can't,

1483
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,570
has a lot to do with how well
they manage their blood sugar

1484
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,570
as well as some of the
psychological factors.

1485
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,657
And yes, their family
and historical reasons,

1486
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:31,830
you know, I've got friends
who had a lot of siblings,

1487
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,020
and when they sit down to eat

1488
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,450
they have to really suppress the desire

1489
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,750
to not beat up everyone else at the table

1490
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:38,583
and take all the food.

1491
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:39,940
It's sort of like not...

1492
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,400
It's hard for them to understand

1493
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,570
that there's plenty to go around,

1494
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,430
because of their upbringing.

1495
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,793
So there are psychological
top-down effects.

1496
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,380
A lot of the psychology around food

1497
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,377
is geared towards getting people
to be relaxed when they eat

1498
01:00:52,377 --> 01:00:53,810
and these sorts of things.

1499
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,780
But these blood sugar
effects are real just cellar

1500
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,740
and basic biochemistry

1501
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,840
of how the body manages sugars
ingested into the blood.

1502
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,630
So what does this all mean?

1503
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,760
It means that if you want a
steep increase in glucose,

1504
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,840
you are very, very hungry,

1505
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,410
then you should eat the
carbohydrate laid in food first,

1506
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,060
or you should eat a bunch
of macronutrients combined.

1507
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,360
So that would be like the
hamburger or the sandwich,

1508
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,810
the bread, the whatever's
in that sandwich altogether,

1509
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,923
usually that's protein
and vegetables as well.

1510
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,340
If you want to have a more
modest increase in glucose

1511
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,230
or you want to blunt
the increase in glucose,

1512
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:35,480
then have the, at least some
of the fibrous thing first,

1513
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,170
and then the protein and
then the carbohydrate.

1514
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:39,800
You will notice that your blood glucose

1515
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,610
will rise more steadily,

1516
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,820
and that you'll achieve
satiety earlier in the meal.

1517
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,190
Or at least you won't get this huge peak

1518
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,400
at sort of the Thanksgiving meal effect.

1519
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,490
Some of you are international,

1520
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,450
so if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving

1521
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,320
is a time of year where...

1522
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,310
It used to be the one-time
a year or two times a year

1523
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,940
where Americans would
give themselves permission

1524
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,860
to eat enormous meals.

1525
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,850
Now that seems to happen a lot more often.

1526
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,660
But there is this effect of you're full

1527
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,930
and yet you're hungry for more,

1528
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,840
that's because your blood
glucose has gone through the roof

1529
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,140
and it's triggered a
number of other mechanisms.

1530
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,640
There's also usually a lot
of alcohol consumption,

1531
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,690
and alcohol itself because it's a sugar

1532
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:21,100
will increase blood
glucose very, very sharply.

1533
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,560
It depends on the alcohol,

1534
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,500
some alcohols have more sugar than others.

1535
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,160
But basically what you're trying to avoid

1536
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,650
are steep increases in blood sugar.

1537
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:29,010
And the order that you eat foods

1538
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,180
has an enormous impact on that.

1539
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,830
The other thing that
has an enormous impact

1540
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,870
on how long and shallow,

1541
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:39,500
or how steep that curve of glucose is,

1542
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,810
depends on on whether or not
you recently were moving,

1543
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,590
are moving or start moving after you eat.

1544
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:48,930
So it turns out that
your blood glucose levels

1545
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:52,380
can be modulated very, very
powerfully by movement.

1546
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,060
If you did any kind of intense exercise,

1547
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,570
or even just walking or jogging,

1548
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,170
or cycling anything before you eat

1549
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,280
your blood glucose levels
will be dampened somewhat.

1550
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,530
And that has to do with the
release of something called,

1551
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,060
some people call it GLUT4,
which sounds like glutton.

1552
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,980
Other people call it GLUT4.

1553
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,860
These are things that are
involved in shuttling glucose

1554
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:13,340
to particular cells in the body,

1555
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,290
namely toward muscle and glycogen stores

1556
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,420
and away from body fat stores.

1557
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,750
It has to do with sequestering
of glucose from the blood.

1558
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,840
The point is that, if you're somebody

1559
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,560
who struggles with blood sugar regulation,

1560
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,160
in addition to getting your
body weight in a healthy range,

1561
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,003
doing all the other sorts of things

1562
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:29,253
that you should be doing,

1563
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,310
the key thing is to try
and get some movement,

1564
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,090
sometime as circuit meal.

1565
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,050
Now, very few people

1566
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,770
can actually eat and
walk at the same time,

1567
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,470
although I do it all the time.

1568
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,110
Not because I'm trying to
regulate my blood sugar

1569
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,180
but just 'cause I tend to be busy.

1570
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,160
I eat and drive, [mumbles] busy.

1571
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,830
Busy if I'm not giving this podcast,

1572
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,280
or if sleeping, I'm eating,

1573
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,580
but except the early part
of the day when I fast.

1574
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,420
But the bottom line here is that,

1575
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:57,350
if you, for instance take a
30 minute walk after a meal,

1576
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,200
your blood glucose will be blunted

1577
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,130
in ways that are beneficial.

1578
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,770
If you have exercised in the
recent hours before a meal,

1579
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:05,770
that can be beneficial.

1580
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:07,860
The order that you consume
foods is beneficial.

1581
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,920
And there are a few things
that you can consume

1582
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,260
that can also adjust blood glucose levels.

1583
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:13,410
So let's talk about those,

1584
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,830
but I thought it was
important to really tamp down

1585
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,070
that it's not just what you eat,

1586
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,160
we talked about that before,

1587
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,350
but also the order that
you eat those things,

1588
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,183
believe it or not,

1589
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:24,000
whether or not you
combine macro-nutrients,

1590
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,980
carbohydrates, proteins and
fats and fibrous vegetables.

1591
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:31,030
And whether or not you've moved recently.

1592
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,480
The higher intensity the movement,

1593
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,060
the greater the GLUT4 increase,

1594
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:37,480
and the more that the blood
glucose will be blunted

1595
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,847
and you'll shuttle more
of that to glycogen

1596
01:04:38,847 --> 01:04:40,220
and muscle stores.

1597
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,490
And even just moving after a meal,

1598
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,980
even just a calm easy walk,

1599
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,860
can really adjust the ways in
which blood sugar regulated

1600
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,130
for the better.

1601
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,720
I don't want to perseverate
on this processed foods,

1602
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,210
hidden sugars thing too much.

1603
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,070
But understanding now

1604
01:04:56,070 --> 01:05:00,370
a little bit about how
insulin and glucose work,

1605
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,050
you can probably imagine why hidden sugars

1606
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,310
are such an attractive thing

1607
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:07,160
from the standpoint of
processed food manufacturers.

1608
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,020
Because if they can put sugar
in that you can't even taste,

1609
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,930
that sugar is going to
amplify the amount of glucose,

1610
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:16,500
it's going to increase the
rate of glucose increase

1611
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,550
into your bloodstream

1612
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,750
and it's going to promote more feeding.

1613
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,620
So in that case, you're
really being tricked.

1614
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,000
It's not that you're actually reaching

1615
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,450
for the additional appetizer

1616
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,200
and your blood glucose is going up.

1617
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,480
The food that you ate

1618
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,170
is actually increasing your
appetite as you eat it.

1619
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,950
It's a positive feedback loop.

1620
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,780
So don't want to demonize those
any more than I already have,

1621
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,550
but you should be aware that
these things are happening

1622
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,700
at the level of your
bloodstream and brain.

1623
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,520
The other thing I'd like
to address for a moment,

1624
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,180
is this notion of stable blood sugar

1625
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:50,660
versus lay bile blood sugar
or unstable blood sugar.

1626
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,550
Some people just have stable blood sugar.

1627
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,710
They can go long periods
of time without eating

1628
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,570
and feel fine.

1629
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,440
Other people get really
shaky, really jittery,

1630
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,130
and/or when they do eat,
they feel really keyed up.

1631
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,680
Sometimes they'll even sweat.

1632
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,950
Sometimes their vision will go blurry.

1633
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:08,810
And some of that can actually be

1634
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,660
because they've become hyperglycemic.

1635
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:14,550
And those effects that you experience

1636
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:18,280
when you are hyperglycemic
are the early warning signs

1637
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,320
of the kinds of things that damage neurons

1638
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,470
and lead to the really terrible stuff

1639
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,550
they talked about before
like peripheral neuropathies.

1640
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,300
Now, it takes some time
for those things to occur,

1641
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,790
those neuropathies to occur.

1642
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,140
But whether or not your blood
sugar is all over the place

1643
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,060
or whether or not stable,

1644
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,760
can be impacted by a number of things.

1645
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,890
One of those things is exercise.

1646
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,950
So these days there's a lot of interest

1647
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,380
in what they call zone two cardio,

1648
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,100
which is that kind of steady state cardio,

1649
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,590
where you can just nasal breathe

1650
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,570
even at pretty high output,

1651
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,770
where you could maybe have a conversation.

1652
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,090
Although I'm such a huge proponent

1653
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,690
of nasal breathing during exercise,

1654
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:54,430
most forms of exercise
especially zone two cardio,

1655
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,550
that you probably shouldn't be talking

1656
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,810
while you're doing that cardio

1657
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,960
unless it's absolutely essential.

1658
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,950
But periods of zone two cardio

1659
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:07,010
that lasts anywhere from
30 minutes to an hour

1660
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:09,310
or sometimes more for
your endurance athletes,

1661
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,320
can create positive effects
on blood sugar regulation,

1662
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:18,320
such that you people can sit
down and enjoy whatever it is,

1663
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,640
the hot fudge sundae,

1664
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,930
or whatever the high
sugar content food is.

1665
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:24,880
And blood glucose management is so good.

1666
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,600
Your insulin sensitivity is so
high, which is a good thing,

1667
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,940
that you can manage that blood glucose

1668
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,980
to the point where it doesn't
really make you shaky,

1669
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,690
it doesn't disrupt you.

1670
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:39,430
And you know, to say nothing
of the weight-related issues

1671
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,810
or the adipose fat gain, et cetera,

1672
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,950
that's a separate issue
because people vary there.

1673
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:48,950
But basically doing zone two
cardio for 30 to 60 minutes,

1674
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,780
three to four times a week

1675
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,910
makes your blood sugar really stable,

1676
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:55,670
and that's an attractive thing
for a variety of reasons.

1677
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:58,710
On the flip side, high
intensity interval training

1678
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:01,230
or resistance training
AKA weight training,

1679
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:04,600
are very good at stimulating
the various molecules

1680
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,130
that promote repackaging of glycogen.

1681
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:10,940
So sprints, heavy weight lifting,
circuit type weightlifting

1682
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,710
provided there is some
reasonable degree of resistance,

1683
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:16,140
those are going to trigger
are all sorts of mechanisms

1684
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,830
that are going to encourage the body

1685
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:22,100
to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,

1686
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,790
converting to glycogen,
into muscle tissue,

1687
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,680
restock the liver, et cetera.

1688
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,160
Depleting one's glycogen
actually takes some time.

1689
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,140
You know, if you do a couple
sets of tricep extensions

1690
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,500
and some crunches, you're
not depleting your glycogen.

1691
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,640
Glycogen depleting workouts
are very high intensity.

1692
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,770
Generally they're less than an hour or so,

1693
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:41,750
but those are the sort

1694
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,770
that are going to lead to big increases

1695
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,890
in the kinds of enzymes
and metabolic pathways

1696
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,970
that are going to repack
glycogen and shuttle most things

1697
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,439
towards restorage of foods

1698
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,489
not into adipose tissue, not into fat,

1699
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:55,899
but taking glucose and
making it into fuels

1700
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:56,849
that you can access later

1701
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:59,550
for more of that high intensity activity.

1702
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:01,520
And I should mention that
one of the advantages

1703
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,270
of high intensity interval training

1704
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:07,790
or weightlifting of various kinds,

1705
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:12,010
is that it causes long standing increases

1706
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,330
in basal metabolic rate.

1707
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,810
I don't want to go too far down this path

1708
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,830
because we're going to do an entire month

1709
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:19,710
on human performance and
athletic performance.

1710
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,710
But it's not just the increases in muscle

1711
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:26,600
that increase metabolism,
because muscle burns more energy

1712
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,950
than other types of tissues,

1713
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,540
except your brain, which
truly burns the most energy.

1714
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,460
Anyway is the main reason

1715
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,673
why your basal metabolic
rate is what it is.

1716
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,689
Well, high-intensity training.

1717
01:09:38,689 --> 01:09:39,709
So it could be sprints,

1718
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,270
it could be high intensity
interval training

1719
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:43,220
of different kinds, it
could be weight training,

1720
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,279
also has an effect of
increasing thermogenesis

1721
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,549
even long after you've
completed the exercise.

1722
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,710
So there's a long tail.

1723
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:54,590
There's a kind of post
exercise metabolic effect

1724
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,900
that's also beneficial.

1725
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,440
So it's not an either or,

1726
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,280
it's really that high
intensity interval training

1727
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,290
and resistance training.

1728
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,540
And things of that sort are
very good for one reason.

1729
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,120
And the zone two cardio is
very good for other reasons.

1730
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,390
And now you can see why
it's just a healthy thing

1731
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:11,460
and why most people should
probably be doing exercise

1732
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,230
most days of the week, if
not every day of the week.

1733
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:17,540
If your goal is to manage blood glucose

1734
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:21,130
and your goal is to manage
some of the metabolic factors

1735
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,290
that control repackaging of glycogen

1736
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,740
and encouraging excess glucose

1737
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,430
to not get diverted into body fat stores.

1738
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,660
We haven't talked a
lot about lipids today,

1739
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,020
that's because most of today's
discussion is about hormones

1740
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,150
and insulin is the dominant hormone

1741
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:40,040
in terms of mobilizing and
managing glucose in the body,

1742
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,290
at least for most people.

1743
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,440
But fats are very important.

1744
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,290
And there's just a little
anecdote about fats

1745
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,810
that I think will be useful in thinking

1746
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,500
about why you want to manage

1747
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,617
what they call the LDL or HDL ratios.

1748
01:10:52,617 --> 01:10:54,970
And this is deserving an entire episode,

1749
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:57,260
many, perhaps even several episodes.

1750
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:01,570
But some of you may be
familiar with LDLs and HDLs,

1751
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,630
some of you may not.

1752
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,340
The LDL is low density lipoprotein.

1753
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,170
This is the one that you
don't want it to be too high.

1754
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,638
Castillo's dreaming, he's barking.

1755
01:11:10,638 --> 01:11:13,020
He loves all forms of cholesterol

1756
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,670
but that's just Castillo dreaming.

1757
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:18,050
So LDLs are the ones that
you want to keep low.

1758
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:19,980
You don't want those
to go excessively high.

1759
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,360
HDLs, the high density lipoproteins

1760
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,113
are the ones that are the
so-called healthy lipoproteins.

1761
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,640
That's all fine and good.

1762
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,010
But you might ask yourself,
what are they doing?

1763
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,860
What is the actual role of these things,

1764
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:36,700
and why would you want
healthy levels of HDL

1765
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,500
and not too much LDL?

1766
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,220
Well, one of the reasons is,

1767
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,750
that fats don't like water, right?

1768
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,640
They are hydrophobic.

1769
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,960
And yet you need to move
fats in your bloodstream,

1770
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,180
all tissues in your body need fats.

1771
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,630
They need cholesterols, they're...

1772
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,430
In last episode we
talked about cholesterol

1773
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:56,560
is a precursor to the
sex steroid hormones,

1774
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,810
estrogen, and testosterone
and other hormones as well.

1775
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:04,330
Well, HDL and LDL, actually coat fats

1776
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:07,180
to allow them to be transported
through the bloodstream.

1777
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,030
They do a number of other things as well.

1778
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:13,280
But HDL, is a key component
of the delivery system

1779
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,440
that brings those fats
to the liver, ovaries,

1780
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,420
testes, and adrenals.

1781
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,320
In other words, having
adequate levels of HDL is good,

1782
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,830
because it allows fats to
be delivered to the tissues

1783
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:28,330
that manufactured testosterone, estrogen,

1784
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,500
cortisol in healthy levels and the liver.

1785
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,340
So this is why when LDLs are too high

1786
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,290
what's happening is
you're not getting fats

1787
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,190
to the correct tissues.

1788
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,160
And you can get buildup of fats

1789
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,300
like fatty liver disease

1790
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,630
and some of these things can happen.

1791
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,080
A high sugar content

1792
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,920
can even lead to some of
these fatty liver conditions

1793
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,770
that starting to happen

1794
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:51,310
is actually the first time
in human history perhaps

1795
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,810
that we're aware of anyway.

1796
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,400
That we're starting to
see liver conditions

1797
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,180
that normally were associated
only with severe alcoholism

1798
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,590
starting to come from sugar content.

1799
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,600
So what does this mean?

1800
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,150
This means keep your LDL
and HDL ratios proper.

1801
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:08,890
You want those HDLs in order
to deliver fatty molecules

1802
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,950
to the very tissues that use cholesterol

1803
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,090
in order to manufacturer hormones.

1804
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:16,150
So how do you keep LDLs and
HDLs in their proper ratios?

1805
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,050
Well, a lot of people don't realize this,

1806
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:22,700
but the debate about dietary cholesterol

1807
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,033
and its relationship
to LDL and HDL ratios,

1808
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,520
it is a barbed wire debate.

1809
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,050
I don't want to get into it right now.

1810
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:32,300
There are still a lot of open questions

1811
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,160
as to how much dietary cholesterol

1812
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,960
impacts LDL and HDL ratios.

1813
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,920
I don't want to get into that now,

1814
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,900
I'm not taking a stance either way.

1815
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,570
But what is very clear,

1816
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:45,870
is that having highly elevated glucose,

1817
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:47,180
consuming too much sugar

1818
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,320
or not managing glucose in your body

1819
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,390
through some of the mechanisms

1820
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,880
that we've been talking
about up until now,

1821
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,610
can also negatively
impact LDL, HDL ratios.

1822
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,190
So managing glucose goes way beyond

1823
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,980
just managing blood sugar,

1824
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,510
and making sure that you don't
lay down too much body fat,

1825
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:04,940
making sure your metabolism stays high

1826
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,550
and making sure you're not
getting jittery at meals.

1827
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,330
It also has to do with

1828
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:12,170
making sure that you're creating
enough of the molecules HDL

1829
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:15,690
and not too many of the molecules LDL,

1830
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,670
that are going to disrupt
the delivery of things

1831
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,200
to the organs of your body

1832
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,580
that allow you to make healthy
levels of testosterone,

1833
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,170
estrogen, and so forth.

1834
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:27,090
If that wasn't clear, let
me make this ultra simple.

1835
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:29,400
You want healthy levels of HDL,

1836
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,820
and you want low levels of LDL,

1837
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,640
because if you have ovaries

1838
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:38,160
it will allow the fats that
need to get to the ovary

1839
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,810
to produce estrogen, to get there.

1840
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:44,060
And if you have testes,
it will allow the fats

1841
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:46,090
and the cholesterol
molecules that you need

1842
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:51,090
in order to manufacture
testosterone to get to the testes.

1843
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:54,250
As well, in order to have
proper adrenal function

1844
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,480
and proper liver function,

1845
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,240
you want HDL and LDL in
the healthy correct levels.

1846
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,910
So now we've talked a lot
about behavioral tools

1847
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,120
and the underlying biological mechanisms

1848
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,800
that justify those tools in
particular circumstances.

1849
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,090
Now, I'd like to turn to
supplements and prescription drugs

1850
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,560
that regulate the hormone systems,

1851
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,040
controlling feeding and satiety.

1852
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,570
There are a huge number of these.

1853
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:19,600
Some have more powerful
effects than others.

1854
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,790
There are two that I want to describe

1855
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:25,000
because they've been getting
a lot of attention recently.

1856
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,280
First of all, there's a
prescription drug Metformin,

1857
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,770
which was developed as a
treatment for diabetes.

1858
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:34,490
And it works potently
to reduce blood glucose.

1859
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:38,600
It has dramatic effects
in lowering blood glucose.

1860
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,600
Metformin involves changes
to mitochondrial action

1861
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:44,560
in the liver.

1862
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,470
That's its main way of depleting
or reducing blood glucose.

1863
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:53,140
And it does so through the
so-called AMPK pathway,

1864
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,860
and it increases insulin
sensitivity overall.

1865
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,740
Metformin is a powerful drug.

1866
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,510
In fact, I'm surprised that so many people

1867
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:05,460
have sought it out, given
that most of the people

1868
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,730
that I'm aware of that sought
it out are not diabetic.

1869
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,820
I think for diabetics it
seems to be a useful drug.

1870
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,310
For non-diabetics, it can also of course,

1871
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:14,560
lower blood glucose.

1872
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,700
It also has the potential
to make people hypoglycemic,

1873
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,560
genuinely hypoglycemic.

1874
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,060
So, you really need to approach
Metformin with caution.

1875
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:23,920
I get a little concern

1876
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,140
when I hear about people
blasting Metformin,

1877
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:30,450
simply because fasted states
or low blood sugar states

1878
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,323
are healthy.

1879
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,920
Doing that pharmacologically
can have long standing effects.

1880
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,620
You really want to
approach that with caution.

1881
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,180
Now, there's a comparable drug,

1882
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,570
it really should be called a drug.

1883
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,230
But it's non-prescription,

1884
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,330
that's also in fairly
prominent use out there

1885
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:51,330
called berberine, B-E-R
B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.

1886
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:58,130
So berberine is a really
interesting compound.

1887
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:01,370
Its actions very much mimic Metformin.

1888
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:04,100
So let's talk about
berberine for a second.

1889
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,420
Berberine actually comes from
various plants and tree bark.

1890
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:11,440
It is sold in supplement
stores, it's sold online.

1891
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,650
It is, as far as I know
unregulated, it is powerful.

1892
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,410
If you're going to
experiment with berberine,

1893
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:18,160
you definitely want to talk to your doctor

1894
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,820
and you want to approach it with caution.

1895
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:25,820
It also works to activate
the so-called AMPK pathway.

1896
01:17:25,963 --> 01:17:27,450
AMPK by the way stands for

1897
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:31,062
Adenosine Monophosphate-activated
protein kinase, AMPK.

1898
01:17:31,062 --> 01:17:34,123
And it inhibits a protein
tyrosine phosphates 1B pathway.

1899
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,500
I think that's enough nomenclature.

1900
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,390
It activates a certain pathway

1901
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:41,950
that's associated with
fasting and low blood glucose.

1902
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:46,380
The effects of berberine
are as far as I can tell,

1903
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,840
when looking at the literature,

1904
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,833
are very similar if not
identical to Metformin.

1905
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:57,010
Now, the number of studies
out there on this are many.

1906
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:58,650
So I'm just going to review a few of them

1907
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:00,140
and their major effects.

1908
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,870
As always, I invite you
to check out examine.com.

1909
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:04,910
It's a wonderful website

1910
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,700
where you can put in any
supplement or compound

1911
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,630
or biological goal for that matter.

1912
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,850
And it will list out the various effects

1913
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,240
in the human effect matrix.

1914
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,830
So studies on humans,
if they're available.

1915
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,410
And it will tell you whether
or not they're strong effects

1916
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:19,780
or weak effects or modest effects.

1917
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,853
And it will point to the
specific subject population,

1918
01:18:21,853 --> 01:18:24,090
it's a wonderful resource.

1919
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:27,860
So berberine, not surprisingly
has very strong effects

1920
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:29,000
in lowering blood glucose.

1921
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,940
There are four studies on this.

1922
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,310
In fact, they say that
berberine is one of the more

1923
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,210
if not the most effective supplements

1924
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:36,450
for lowering blood glucose.

1925
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:38,180
It talks about dosages there.

1926
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,270
Although I'll just mention
that I've tried berberine,

1927
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:44,720
and the dosages that are
typical on the bottle

1928
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,170
of most supplements, is
much higher than I needed.

1929
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:51,900
So when I took berberine,
two things happened,

1930
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,700
first of all, I got a
pretty splitting headache.

1931
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,220
It gave me pretty vicious headache.

1932
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,890
So for me it was a no, almost immediately.

1933
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:03,300
The other thing is, I
became so hypoglycemic.

1934
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,460
That in order to get
my blood sugar back up,

1935
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,570
I think I ate something like 10 donuts

1936
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,920
and I didn't feel like I had
ingested all that much sugar.

1937
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,900
It was really kind of weird.

1938
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,220
I was hyperphagic for sugar.

1939
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,397
I was craving sugar, craving sugar

1940
01:19:14,397 --> 01:19:16,320
and I was very thirsty as well.

1941
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,700
And so, I don't want to
promote any bad behavior,

1942
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,480
but I know that certain people use this

1943
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,020
when they've overeaten sugars

1944
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,380
or they're doing their cheat days,

1945
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,860
something that I'm
personally just not a fan of.

1946
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,650
And they want to keep
their blood sugar in check

1947
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,240
or they know they're going
to consume a huge meal.

1948
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,990
They'll take berberine to
keep blood glucose clamped.

1949
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,490
And it does do that.

1950
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,300
It has very strong effects.

1951
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,550
Three peer reviewed
studies on HbA1c levels.

1952
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:42,690
HbA1c is something that can
be measured in a blood test.

1953
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,930
That is sort of an average readout

1954
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,150
of your blood sugar levels

1955
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:48,150
over the previous two or three months,

1956
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,130
sometimes shorter period.

1957
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:53,720
But that's mostly what HbA1c is about.

1958
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:58,540
So, it radically decreases
your blood sugar levels.

1959
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,250
It actually lowers cholesterol.

1960
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,970
It acts remember on the liver,

1961
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:06,260
and the liver is involved
in cholesterol metabolism.

1962
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,340
And remember it's both
sugars, blood glucose,

1963
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,880
and dietary fats.

1964
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,910
Perhaps it's still heavily debated

1965
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,320
in terms of how your
blood total cholesterol

1966
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,870
HDL and LDL are regulated.

1967
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,850
So it seems to lower total cholesterol,

1968
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:25,400
and it seems like it lowers
HDL and LDL in parallel.

1969
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,130
So that's interesting.

1970
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:29,447
One study showed a minor increase in HDL,

1971
01:20:29,447 --> 01:20:31,230
the so-called good cholesterol.

1972
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:32,970
Insulin levels dropped, not surprising.

1973
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,770
Another study showed a
slight decrease in LDL,

1974
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:36,970
though seem to be kind of minor.

1975
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,180
Here's a kind of interesting one,

1976
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,800
just to help you remember berberine

1977
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,760
as of the fact that it
comes from tree bark,

1978
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,770
isn't trigger enough to remember it.

1979
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:48,080
Direct contact of
berberine on canker sores

1980
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,170
seems to eliminate canker
sores very quickly,

1981
01:20:50,170 --> 01:20:51,250
which is kind of cool.

1982
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,650
I've not had canker sores in a few years

1983
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:55,804
but when I dig down,
they're extremely painful.

1984
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:56,637
I don't like those.

1985
01:20:56,637 --> 01:20:57,520
So that's kind of interesting,

1986
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,850
and there's some study references there.

1987
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:01,700
I find it amazing that
these compounds exist.

1988
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,450
You've got this
prescription drug Metformin,

1989
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,750
and then you've got berberine,
this stuff from tree bark,

1990
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,970
and they have effects that
are essentially equivalent

1991
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:08,890
to one another.

1992
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,050
So again, I'm not promoting their use

1993
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:13,060
or even their exploration,

1994
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:15,520
but those compounds do
exist, they're out there.

1995
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,880
And check out examine.com
if you'd like to learn more.

1996
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,860
Certainly do your
reading, do your homework,

1997
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,880
before you start just popping the stuff.

1998
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,880
And if you have hypoglycemia
or hyperglycemia,

1999
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:32,230
be especially careful and also
do understand that dosages

2000
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,870
and dose requirements vary.

2001
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,713
So if you do go down this path,

2002
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:37,960
really approach things carefully.

2003
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,350
Always start with the lowest amount

2004
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,850
that you could get away with.

2005
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,210
For me, the headache thing
just made it a no-go.

2006
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:47,920
I do keep a bottle of
it in a full disclosure,

2007
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,030
in the odd chance

2008
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:52,510
that I feel like eating
a ton of doughnuts.

2009
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:55,960
It's not so much about not
ingesting the calories,

2010
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,210
it's just that I don't like the feeling

2011
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,410
of being hyperglycemic,

2012
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,750
the blurry vision, just feeling lousy,

2013
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,620
I do love donuts.

2014
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,570
Other things that impact blood
glucose in supplement form.

2015
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:10,030
Chromium has been shown in
29 studies to have a minor,

2016
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:13,120
I want to emphasize a minor
effect on reducing blood glucose.

2017
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,270
Things like L-carnitine,

2018
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,100
something we've talked about
here on the podcast before

2019
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,450
in terms of its relationship

2020
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:20,450
to power output in ATP production

2021
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:23,330
for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise,

2022
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,960
as well as sperm quality and egg quality.

2023
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,653
We talked about that long ago.

2024
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:34,730
Things like Panax ginseng
can have positive effects on,

2025
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,140
I should say, can have effects

2026
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,320
of reducing blood glucose slightly.

2027
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,780
I don't want to give a
valence to or judgment

2028
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,210
to whether or not it's
positive or negative.

2029
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,043
Here's something that's interesting

2030
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:45,090
that you should know about.

2031
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:49,380
Caffeine has very reliably been shown

2032
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,500
to increase blood glucose
just a little bit, okay?

2033
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,530
So I always thought that caffeine
would drop blood glucose,

2034
01:22:56,530 --> 01:23:00,430
but it actually can increase
blood glucose just slightly.

2035
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,880
Things like magnesium.

2036
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,690
We talked about magnesium

2037
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:07,970
as a tool for enhancing
the passage into sleep,

2038
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:10,770
in particular magnesium
threonate and bisglycinate.

2039
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:14,840
Magnesium can also have a modest
reduction in blood glucose.

2040
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,750
You're just trying to get the impression,

2041
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,170
everything reduces blood glucose,

2042
01:23:17,170 --> 01:23:18,410
but that's certainly not the case.

2043
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,480
And then a couple episodes ago

2044
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,500
when we were discussing nutrition

2045
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,960
we talked about artificial
sweeteners, sucralose,

2046
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,323
aspartame, NutraSweet.

2047
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:29,750
Some of those are generic names.

2048
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,070
Some of those might be brand names

2049
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:33,810
and how they have negative
effects on the gut microbiome

2050
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:35,320
and that's supported
by a number of studies.

2051
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,320
There's one artificial sweetener,
it's stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A,

2052
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,120
which seems to lower blood
glucose just slightly.

2053
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,970
And I still can't find data

2054
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,320
on whether or not Stevia
impacts the gut microbiome

2055
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,110
in either direction.

2056
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,430
Many of the things that I consume

2057
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,070
do have small amounts of Stevia in them.

2058
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:56,890
So I'd love to know if anyone out there

2059
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:59,540
is aware of quality
peer reviewed research,

2060
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:03,460
as to whether or not Stevia
impacts the gut microbiome

2061
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:07,540
similarly or differently from
other artificial sweeteners.

2062
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,373
Please let me know.

2063
01:24:08,373 --> 01:24:09,400
Please send me the references.

2064
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,233
I'd really appreciate it

2065
01:24:10,233 --> 01:24:12,970
if put it in the comment
section on YouTube or elsewhere.

2066
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,230
Comment section on YouTube
would be the best place.

2067
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:18,560
So Stevia seems to lower
blood glucose a little bit,

2068
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,610
which makes it kind of an
attractive artificial sweetener

2069
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:24,820
if one is going to use
artificial sweeteners.

2070
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,980
But remember, sweet taste itself

2071
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,600
stimulates the desire to eat,

2072
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,330
which will increase more blood glucose.

2073
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,290
So I'm guessing that they
probably cancel each other out.

2074
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:35,060
So you have to think
logically about these things.

2075
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,390
Vitamin B3, so some of the B vitamins

2076
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:39,290
do indeed stimulate appetite

2077
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:41,490
by triggering increases in blood glucose,

2078
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:42,820
vitamin B3 in particular.

2079
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,300
I don't know if B6 does.

2080
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,490
Things like zinc seem
to lower blood glucose.

2081
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:49,120
And then there've been an
enormous number of other things

2082
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,520
that have been tested for
their roles in blood glucose.

2083
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,150
Apple cider vinegar, anything acidic.

2084
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:59,380
This is well-known now
that any kind of acidity,

2085
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,300
so it could be lemon juice or lime juice,

2086
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,790
or Apple cider vinegar,
lowers blood glucose slightly.

2087
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,550
Some of those can also have other effects

2088
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:08,180
that we're not talking about today.

2089
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,280
So that's kind of interesting

2090
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,260
because there's a movement now

2091
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,760
towards creating a sort
of people talk about

2092
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,980
becoming more alkaline,
you know, what these...

2093
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,040
I hate to break it to you

2094
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,290
but you don't really want
your body to be too alkaline.

2095
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,930
You want to stay in the right
pH or else you're start...

2096
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:26,740
There are conditions that
make you more alkaline.

2097
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,320
You don't want to be too
acidic or too alkaline.

2098
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,290
If you see a beverage or something

2099
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:35,010
that purports that ingesting that beverage

2100
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:37,090
is going to make you more alkaline,

2101
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,410
that is absolutely false.

2102
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:41,210
There's no evidence for that,
is impossible biochemically.

2103
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,900
It's just marketing.

2104
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,230
But nonetheless ingesting
foods that are acidic

2105
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:51,900
can make some slight
adjustments to the pH of the gut

2106
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,890
in ways that can slow or
alter the absorption of foods

2107
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,970
and can blunt blood glucose.

2108
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,300
You can try this sometime if you want,

2109
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,390
if ever you're feeling
kind of over sugared out

2110
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,110
like you ate something
with too much sugar.

2111
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:05,110
You can drink a small
amount of lemon juice

2112
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:06,490
mixed with water or lime juice,

2113
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,300
and you'll notice that it will blunt

2114
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,460
that kind of hyperglycemic
effect just a little bit.

2115
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,420
Again, you don't want to
use this as a medical tool,

2116
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,180
but the effect is fairly potent.

2117
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,890
And then, excuse me.

2118
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:21,010
And then there are a
number of other things

2119
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:23,040
like capsaicin and hot chili peppers

2120
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,080
that will lower blood glucose.

2121
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,640
The list goes on and on,

2122
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,270
The most powerful one is
absolutely berberine and Metformin,

2123
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:33,010
but that's really heavy caliber stuff.

2124
01:26:33,010 --> 01:26:36,150
And the other ones I mentioned
have more minor effects.

2125
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,900
I do want to mention because
I'm sure some of you out there

2126
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,380
are curious about the ketogenic diet.

2127
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,040
I'm going to do an entire
episode about ketosis

2128
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,720
and the brain and the body,

2129
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:49,720
but the ketogenic diet has
been shown in 22 studies

2130
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,840
to have a notable
decrease on blood glucose.

2131
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,180
And that is not surprising,

2132
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:56,750
because the essence of the ketogenic diet

2133
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:00,230
is that you're consuming
very little or zero

2134
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:04,223
of the foods that promote big
spikes in insulin and glucose.

2135
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,420
If you consume enough protein,

2136
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:09,210
some of that protein can
be converted into glucose,

2137
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:11,170
of course, through gluconeogenesis.

2138
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:14,350
But the ketogenic diet
has a very strong support

2139
01:27:15,589 --> 01:27:19,290
for its role in regulating
blood sugar, which is glucose.

2140
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:22,500
But the specific effects
of the ketogenic diet,

2141
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,420
and one particular effect
that I'll address later

2142
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,870
but I'll mention now,

2143
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:29,620
which is, the ability
of the ketogenic diet

2144
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,020
to adjust thyroid hormone levels

2145
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,270
in ways that make it

2146
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:36,580
such that if you return
to eating carbohydrates

2147
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,840
after being in ketosis for too long,

2148
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,920
you don't manage fibroid
and carbohydrates as well,

2149
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,500
that has been shown as well.

2150
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,180
So we're going to dive deep into ketosis

2151
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,300
in a future episode.

2152
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,840
So for you ketonistas does
out there don't worry,

2153
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,200
I certainly have nothing
against ketogenic diet.

2154
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,650
I actually don't have anything

2155
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:54,810
for against any particular nutrition plan.

2156
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:57,450
I know it works for me, at
least at this stage in my life.

2157
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:58,990
And I'll update it if I need to.

2158
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,950
I'm simply trying to get
you as much information

2159
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,410
as I possibly can,

2160
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,860
so that you can navigate
through that landscape

2161
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:08,560
in a way that's in keeping
with your particular goals.

2162
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,930
So now you understand
a lot about blood sugar

2163
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:12,100
and how it's managed,

2164
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,980
and the ways that you can manage it better

2165
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,420
depending on your particular needs.

2166
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:19,900
This is also a good
opportunity for us to look back

2167
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,050
at some of the medical literature,

2168
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:25,370
because it really points
to just how far we've come

2169
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,050
in terms of understanding
these important mechanisms.

2170
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:30,010
And it points us in the direction

2171
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,480
of some actionable protocols.

2172
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:37,480
So diabetes, which is these
huge increases in blood glucose,

2173
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,060
because there's no insulin,

2174
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,420
was known about as early as 1500 BC,

2175
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,260
which is just incredible.

2176
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:49,800
And the way physicians then understood

2177
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,980
that certain people had high blood glucose

2178
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,430
without actually knowing
what blood glucose was,

2179
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:57,420
is that they would take the
urine of particular patients,

2180
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,810
and they'd find that ants
preferably move toward

2181
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:06,370
and consume the urine of
certain patients and not others.

2182
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:09,360
And they understood that there
was something in that urine

2183
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,470
that was correlated with the weight loss

2184
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:12,470
and some of the other

2185
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:15,740
probably very unfortunate health symptoms

2186
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,240
that these people were experiencing.

2187
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,120
So they knew that there was
something in blood and urine.

2188
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,230
But you might be asking
yourself, wait, that's urine.

2189
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:29,980
But as I tell every kid
that I meet, two things.

2190
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,960
I tell a kid, your brain is here,

2191
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,170
I make them point to their head.

2192
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,160
And then I tell them, do you know what?

2193
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,940
Do you know that your urine
is actually filtered blood?

2194
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,530
And they usually go, [grunts].

2195
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:41,560
I get parental permission
to do this first.

2196
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,570
But most adults don't realize

2197
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:46,690
that your urine is actually
just filtered blood.

2198
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:49,690
And that's why if you
see blood in your urine,

2199
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:50,730
that's a problem.

2200
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:54,400
You want to filter the blood,
but urine is filtered blood.

2201
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:59,400
Now, this business of measuring
blood sugar from the urine

2202
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:03,030
has been something that lasted way beyond

2203
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,760
these early stages of 1500 BC.

2204
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,313
It turns out that as late as 1674,

2205
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,790
physicians at Oxford
university were figuring out

2206
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:18,440
who had pathologically high
levels of blood glucose

2207
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,870
by analyzing their urine.

2208
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:24,350
And again, they were measuring
the sweetness of their urine,

2209
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:25,610
and this is medical fact.

2210
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:26,443
They would do this

2211
01:30:26,443 --> 01:30:29,250
by taking urine samples
from different patients,

2212
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,310
and tasting them.

2213
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:34,500
And they developed an intuitive sense

2214
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,610
of what excessively sweet urine was

2215
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:40,740
relative to the other
urines that they had tasted.

2216
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,670
So for those of you that are
in the medical profession

2217
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:45,400
or those of you that are seeking
out the medical profession,

2218
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,080
do you understand this
is not done anymore?

2219
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,350
And you can also just
reflect on how far we've come

2220
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:53,770
in terms of the medical profession itself.

2221
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:55,820
In our ability to measure
things from the blood

2222
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,170
and measure things from urine

2223
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:02,170
without having to ask ants
which urine is sweeter

2224
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,960
or ask oneself, which urine is sweeter.

2225
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,470
So indeed we are making
progress as a species.

2226
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:11,440
Before we close out today I
want to talk about one more tool

2227
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,440
that many of you will
probably find useful.

2228
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,170
I certainly have, I'm a
big consumer of caffeine,

2229
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:20,220
although I don't consume a ton of it,

2230
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,770
I consume it very consistently.

2231
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,643
So I'm big on consuming Mate,

2232
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,370
which is a strong caffeinated tea.

2233
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:30,180
And I generally do that early in the day.

2234
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,480
Although I do delay about
two hours after I wake up

2235
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,480
for reasons I've talked
about in previous episode,

2236
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,550
to maintain that nice arc
of alertness and focus.

2237
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:40,540
I do drink black coffee as
well, mushroom coffee as well,

2238
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:41,770
I love that stuff.

2239
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:46,680
But Mate, also called Yerba
Mate, is an interesting compound

2240
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,480
because unlike coffee,

2241
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,110
it has been shown to increase
something called glucagon

2242
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:54,900
like peptide GLP1.

2243
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,650
And increase leptin levels.

2244
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,620
Now, we didn't talk a
lot about glucagon today.

2245
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:01,620
Glucagon is really elevated
in the fasting state.

2246
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,600
I mentioned that it's sort
of the opposite of insulin

2247
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,480
in kind of rough terms

2248
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,970
that's one way to think about it.

2249
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:13,310
But GLP1, or glucagon-like peptide one,

2250
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:15,760
is increased by ingesting Mate

2251
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,840
and it acts as a pretty
nice appetite suppressant.

2252
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,130
Now, I'm not trying to
suppress my appetite.

2253
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:24,290
I like to eat as I mentioned before.

2254
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:27,970
But it works really well
to stimulate the brain

2255
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:31,130
and to give you a level of alertness

2256
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,190
and to do a lot of the
things that coffee does.

2257
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,980
It also contains electrolytes.

2258
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:39,430
So we meaning our neurons and our brain

2259
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:42,010
run on a variety of factors,

2260
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:44,330
electrical activity and chemical
transmission, et cetera,

2261
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:47,420
but they require adequate
levels of sodium potassium

2262
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:48,990
and magnesium.

2263
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:51,860
So, if you were to learn the biology

2264
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,620
or the physiology of the action potential,

2265
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:54,960
the firing of a neuron,

2266
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,210
something we teach every first
year neuroscience student,

2267
01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:00,390
and I'd be happy to teach
you if you're interested.

2268
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:03,230
You'll hear about sodium
rushing into cells

2269
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:06,400
and potassium entering and leaving cells

2270
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,760
in order to allow neurons to communicate.

2271
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,360
Electrolytes are critically important

2272
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,500
for the function of the nervous system.

2273
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,470
And many things that act as diuretics,

2274
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:20,260
that promote excretion
of water, like caffeine,

2275
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,890
can also take electrolytes out along

2276
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:24,400
with in particular sodium.

2277
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,960
And sometimes the lightheadedness

2278
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,980
or the brain fog that people experience,

2279
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,570
isn't just because electrolytes are low

2280
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:31,890
but because they're
kind of out of balance.

2281
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:36,120
So I like Mate because it has
electrolytes, it has caffeine.

2282
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,830
It stimulates the release of
this glucagon-like peptide

2283
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,000
GLP1, and it's been a big help to me

2284
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,690
in extending that early
morning fasting window

2285
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:46,630
out to about noon or so
when I eat my first meal.

2286
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:48,060
It also just tastes really good.

2287
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,460
I don't drink it out of the gourd

2288
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,900
even though I have Argentine lineage.

2289
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,860
The gourd to me it's just
kind of an inconvenience,

2290
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,770
I drink it out of a mug.

2291
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,010
There's no promotion here.

2292
01:33:57,010 --> 01:34:00,020
I have no relationship to
any Yerba Mate plantations

2293
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,810
or companies, I just happen
to really like the stuff.

2294
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:08,590
And the fact that glucagon-like
peptide one is enriched

2295
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:11,560
or is released more when you drink Mate.

2296
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:15,050
And the fact that GLP1
can regulate blood sugar

2297
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,310
in ways that keep your blood sugar

2298
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:20,210
in that we called euglycemic,

2299
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:22,240
not too high, not too low mode,

2300
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:26,090
is one reason why ingesting
Mate is attractive to me.

2301
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:27,840
If you go to South America,

2302
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,210
well, you'll see especially
among Oregonians,

2303
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:32,070
but also Argentines, is
people actually carry

2304
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,740
a thermos of this stuff with them around

2305
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,580
and bring it to meals in restaurants.

2306
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:38,430
And it's just considered
cultural convention,

2307
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,130
it's not unusual to see that.

2308
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:41,990
So we don't see that so
much here in the States

2309
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:43,570
but I happen to really love this stuff.

2310
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,130
I brew my own,

2311
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:47,140
because that's the most
economical way to do it.

2312
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,570
And I really enjoy it.

2313
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:51,000
It can be a little bitter for some people.

2314
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,460
The real key there if you want to know,

2315
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,570
the Mate trick is to not use water

2316
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:55,900
that's really boiling hot.

2317
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,230
You go just shy of boil

2318
01:34:57,230 --> 01:35:02,010
and then it doesn't have that
same kind of tobacco like

2319
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:05,000
or really acidic flavor to it.

2320
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,620
It's just a little bit sweeter,
although not quite sweet.

2321
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:13,170
So, Yerba Meta GLP1, can
manage in healthy ways

2322
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:16,240
leptin levels, glucose
levels, and glucagon levels

2323
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,750
in ways that if it serves you,
that you might want to try.

2324
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:23,250
So once again, we covered an
enormous amount of material,

2325
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:27,340
focused on how hormones
regulate feeding, hunger,

2326
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:30,330
and when one feels they don't need to eat,

2327
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:33,090
so-called satiety, that you've had enough.

2328
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:36,870
As always, we covered a lot,
but I could not be exhaustive

2329
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:39,920
about all the information
related to this topic.

2330
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,150
It's just so vast.

2331
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,870
For instance, we did not
talk about thyroid hormone,

2332
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:47,050
an extremely important hormone and pathway

2333
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:48,400
in the body and brain.

2334
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,650
We are going to do an
episode related to thyroid

2335
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:53,140
and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise.

2336
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:54,680
Having seen this episode,

2337
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:58,853
you will be able to digest that
material with far more ease.

2338
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:02,240
We also didn't talk about the fact that

2339
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:04,990
testosterone and estrogen
can impact blood glucose

2340
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,240
in ways that are opposite to one another.

2341
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,250
That when estrogen levels are high,

2342
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,670
appetite tends to be reduced.

2343
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,730
When testosterone levels are high,

2344
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:15,170
appetite tends to increase.

2345
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:17,260
So there are all sorts
of interesting interplays

2346
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:18,770
between the various hormones.

2347
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:21,720
But that's too much of a deep dive of now.

2348
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,500
Right now, we've just focused today mainly

2349
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:27,800
on things like ghrelin, on things like,

2350
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,310
Melanocyte simulating hormone,

2351
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:32,990
incredible powerful hormone
that can suppress appetite.

2352
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:36,580
On things like Cholecystokinin
that comes from the gut

2353
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,320
and can suppress appetite.

2354
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,550
On things like food emulsifiers.

2355
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:42,580
On the fact that when you're eating

2356
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,750
you are amino acids seeking,

2357
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,420
even though you might not realize it.

2358
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:49,590
That you are also seeking
out particular fatty acids

2359
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:53,440
in particular, the conjugated
linoleic acids and Omega-3's.

2360
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,870
So I've tried to give you a
number of actionable tools.

2361
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:58,750
Many of them behavioral.

2362
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,980
Some of them are based on supplements

2363
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:02,530
or even prescription drugs.

2364
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:04,600
Again, always do what's
best for your health,

2365
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,600
and do that in company with
a healthcare professional.

2366
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,880
I'm not a physician, I
don't prescribe anything.

2367
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,440
I'm a professor, I
profess a lot of things.

2368
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,870
And I try and share with you
what I think to be the best

2369
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,700
high quality peer reviewed literature.

2370
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,240
So that's what I've done today.

2371
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,450
Really appreciate your time and intention.

2372
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,950
Many of you have continued to ask

2373
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:23,850
how you can help support the podcast.

2374
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:26,120
And we really appreciate the question.

2375
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:27,360
There's several ways to do that.

2376
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:31,040
The first is to like a
video that you've seen

2377
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,380
if you like it, and please
subscribe to the YouTube channel.

2378
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,780
That's perhaps the most important thing

2379
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,120
about the YouTube channel.

2380
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,580
As well, leave us a comment.

2381
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:40,250
If you leave us a comment
in the comment section

2382
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,340
that helps us.

2383
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,170
And please ask questions.

2384
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:44,610
Those questions and your comments

2385
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,940
do inform content of future episodes.

2386
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,040
We read them all.

2387
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,470
Except the negative ones we don't read,

2388
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,610
I'm just kidding, we read them all.

2389
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:56,000
In addition, please subscribe
on Apple and/or Spotify

2390
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,540
or both if you like.

2391
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,780
And on Apple, you have the
opportunity to leave us

2392
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,450
up to a five star review if
you feel we deserve that.

2393
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:04,550
Apple also lets you leave a comment,

2394
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:06,810
some feedback for us as well.

2395
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,250
Please do check out our sponsors

2396
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,950
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

2397
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,510
That's the best way perhaps
to support the podcast.

2398
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:15,260
As well we have a Patreon account.

2399
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:18,080
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2400
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,480
And there you can support the
podcast at any level you like.

2401
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,670
And today, as well as
in previous episodes,

2402
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:26,420
I've mentioned various supplements.

2403
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,620
If you're interested in
seeing what supplements I take

2404
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,640
and you want to explore for
some other supplements as well,

2405
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,860
you can go to Thorne

2406
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:37,860
T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash U, the
letter U, slash Huberman.

2407
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:41,370
Thorne is a supplement company

2408
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:43,840
that we believe to have
the highest stringency

2409
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,340
in terms of what they put

2410
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:47,460
in the various supplements that they make.

2411
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,450
And the amounts that they
put are very accurate.

2412
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:51,510
They've partnered with the Mayo Clinic.

2413
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:53,610
They partnered with all
the major sports teams.

2414
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:55,210
And we've partnered with them

2415
01:38:55,210 --> 01:38:57,420
because we believe in
their levels of stringency

2416
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:58,890
and accuracy.

2417
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:03,890
If you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
you can see what I take

2418
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,450
and you'll also get 20% off
any of those supplements

2419
01:39:07,450 --> 01:39:10,270
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

2420
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:13,170
So that's where you can find
out more about supplements

2421
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:14,300
and the ones that I take.

2422
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,370
And again, you get the 20% discount

2423
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,830
on any supplements that Thorne makes.

2424
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:21,710
And last but not least,
thank you for being with us.

2425
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:22,860
I hope you learned a lot.

2426
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:25,420
I hope you explore some of the tools

2427
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:27,880
and that the mechanistic
information that you learned today

2428
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,970
will serve you well.

2429
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:31,400
If you know anyone that's
interested in this topic

2430
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,460
or you think that someone
could benefit from it,

2431
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:35,610
please suggest the
podcast to them as well.

2432
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:38,340
And most of all, thank you
for your interest in science.
