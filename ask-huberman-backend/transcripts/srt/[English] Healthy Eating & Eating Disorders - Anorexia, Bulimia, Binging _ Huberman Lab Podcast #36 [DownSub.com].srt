00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,300
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,710
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,963
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,260
- I'm Andrew Huberman.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,980
And I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,210
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,550
Today, we are going to
talk all about healthy

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,280
and disordered eating.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,520
And indeed, we are going to talk

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,530
about clinical eating disorders,

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,150
such as anorexia, bulimia,
and binge eating disorder,

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,310
as well as some other
related eating disorders.

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,409
However, before we get into this material,

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,090
I want to emphasize that
today's discussion will include

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,380
what it is to have a healthy
relationship with food.

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,610
We're going to talk about metabolism.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,430
We're going to talk about
how eating frequency

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,700
and what one eats influences
things like appetite

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,410
and satiety, as well as whether
or not we have a healthy,

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,430
psychological relationship
to food and our body weight

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,440
and so-called body composition,
the ratio of muscle to fat,

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,803
to bone, et cetera.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,080
So, as we march into this conversation,

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,682
I'd like to share with
you some interesting

25
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:09,840
and what I believe are
important findings in the realm

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,170
of nutrition and human behavior.

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,400
I know these days,

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,940
many people are excited about or curious

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,730
about so-called intermittent fasting,

30
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,760
intermittent fasting
is as the name implies,

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,970
simply restricting one's feeding behavior,

32
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,390
eating to a particular
phase of the 24 hour

33
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,250
or so-called circadian cycle.

34
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,260
Other forms of intermittent
fasting involve not eating

35
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,330
for extended periods of
time for an entire days,

36
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,210
or some people will extend to two days

37
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,657
or three days typically.

38
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:45,620
And hopefully they will drink
water during those times,

39
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,340
sometimes referred to as water fasting,

40
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,230
which means that they
are ingesting fluids.

41
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,830
And hopefully they are ingesting
electrolytes such as salt,

42
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,040
potassium and magnesium as well,

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,790
because well one can
survive for some period

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,770
of time without ingesting calories,

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,880
it is extremely important
to continue to ingest plenty

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,039
of fluids and electrolytes.

47
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,939
And the reason for that is
that the neurons of your brain

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,470
and body that control your
movements, your thoughts,

49
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,983
clarity of thinking in general, et cetera,

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,420
is critically dependent on the
presence of adequate levels

51
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,790
of sodium, potassium and
magnesium, the electrolytes.

52
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,700
And that's because neurons can
only be electrically active

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,500
by way of movement of particular ions,

54
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,370
which include things like
sodium potassium and magnesium.

55
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,600
So, without those,

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,300
you can't think, you can't
function and it actually

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,640
can be quite dangerous.

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,900
So, why all the excitement
about intermittent fasting?

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,170
Well, a lot of the excitement
relates to work that was done

60
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,730
by a former colleague of mine,

61
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,950
down at the Salk Institute
for Biological Studies

62
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,520
in San Diego, named Satchin Panda,

63
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,761
Satchin's lab identified
some very important

64
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:57,110
and impactful health
benefits of restricting

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,330
one's feeding window to particular
within the 24 hour cycle,

66
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,525
or even to having extended
fasts that go for a day

67
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:07,023
or two days, or maybe even three days.

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,080
What they saw was an improvement

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,999
in liver enzymes and improvement
in insulin sensitivity,

70
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,460
which is something that is good.

71
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,160
It means that you can utilize the calories

72
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,150
and the blood sugar
that you happen to have,

73
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,010
being insulin insensitive is not good,

74
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,313
and is actually a form of diabetes.

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,080
What Satchin's lab and
subsequently other labs showed,

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
was that restricting one's
feeding window to anywhere

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,900
from four to eight or even 12 hours

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,480
during each 24 hour cycle
was beneficial in mice.

79
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,710
And some studies in humans have also shown

80
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,230
that it can be beneficial for
various health parameters.

81
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,490
However, the excitement about
intermittent fasting seems

82
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,490
to be related to the foundational
truth about metabolism

83
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:00,410
and weight loss and weight
maintenance and weight gain,

84
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,070
which is that regardless of
whether or not you intermittent

85
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,920
fast or whether or not you
eat small meals all day long,

86
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,710
or you eat one meal in the
evening and snack up until then,

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,710
it really doesn't matter in
the sense that the calories

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,579
that you ingest from whatever source,

89
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,580
are going to be filtered through
the calories that you burn,

90
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,460
by way of exercise, basal metabolic rate,

91
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,780
which is just the calories
that you happen to burn,

92
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,080
just being alive and
thinking and breathing

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,750
and your heart beating, et cetera.

94
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,240
And the reason why many people
will prefer intermittent

95
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,280
fasting to other forms of let's
just call it what it is diet

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,050
or nutritional framework is
that many people find it easier

97
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,060
to not eat, then to
limit their portion size.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,940
And here I'm not talking
necessarily about eating disorders.

99
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,930
I'm talking about the general population.

100
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,574
So, I think that's one reason
why there's so much excitement

101
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:58,490
about intermittent fasting.

102
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,650
Now, within the context
of intermittent fasting

103
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,900
on a circadian timescale,
once every 24 hours,

104
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,038
you generally find two
categories of people,

105
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,990
people who prefer to
not eat in the morning,

106
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,070
either because they are
not hungry in the morning,

107
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,810
or because they find it
relatively straightforward

108
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,130
to just drink things like
coffee or water, et cetera,

109
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,140
and push their feeding window
out to noon or 2:00 P.M.

110
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,740
or 3:00 P.M. and then they'll eat between,

111
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,850
say 1:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M. or 9:00 P.M..

112
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,300
It depends on the individual.

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,540
Other groups of people find
that they are very hungry

114
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,860
when they wake up in the morning,

115
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,120
they don't feel well if
they don't eat breakfast.

116
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,420
And so they prefer to
eat early in the day,

117
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,700
but then they limit their
feeding window such that they cut

118
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,650
off their food intake or
stop ingesting any calories

119
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,430
of any kind, somewhere around 5:00 P.M.

120
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,300
or 6:00 P.M., et cetera.

121
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,050
So, the duration of the feeding window

122
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,830
has not been broken down
into the kind of nuanced type

123
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,000
of information that one would really want.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,610
At least not in human studies saying,

125
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,030
well, a six hour feeding window

126
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,230
or an eight hour feeding window is ideal.

127
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,370
It really is going to
vary based on lifestyle

128
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,770
and circumstances, for instance,

129
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,760
some families really want

130
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,330
to eat dinner together every night.

131
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,210
So, do you want to be
the person that's sitting

132
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,440
there watching everybody eat?

133
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,450
Because you're fasting
from 5:00 P.M. onwards?

134
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,283
I don't know.

135
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:17,690
That's an individual difference.

136
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,620
What you can start to identify, however,

137
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,980
is that people tend to fall
into either one category.

138
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,520
The other people who prefer
to skip eating in the morning

139
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,180
or people that prefer to,

140
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,230
or managed to skip eating in the evening.

141
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,280
And there has been no evidence thus far,

142
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,820
that one is better or worse,

143
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,370
at least in terms of weight loss

144
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,490
or overall health parameters.

145
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,410
Now, you can imagine that some people

146
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,760
might eat breakfast and dinner.

147
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,120
And indeed I have several many colleagues

148
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,840
in fact who just choose to skip lunch,

149
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
because they're busy during the day,

150
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,270
they eat breakfast and dinner,
that doesn't afford the long,

151
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,090
fast associated with sleep.

152
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,923
What do I mean by that?

153
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,810
Well, if you went to sleep at 11:00 P.M.

154
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,870
and you wake up at 6:00 A.M.

155
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,260
by extending your fast until
1:00 P.M. in the afternoon,

156
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,880
you get quite a long period
of no ingesting any calories.

157
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,720
Whereas when you don't eat
during the middle of the day,

158
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,220
you are getting a fasting period.

159
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,390
That's probably anywhere
from four to seven hours,

160
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,992
but it's not linked to
the longer fasting period

161
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:16,220
of not eating while you
are asleep, because most,

162
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,140
all people and I want to emphasize most,

163
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,220
do not eat while they are asleep.

164
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,410
But we are going to talk
about any new disorder

165
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,210
that does exist, where people
actually eat in their sleep.

166
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,332
I know it sounds pretty
wild, but indeed it,

167
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,680
that eating disorder does exist.

168
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,170
And it has a very interesting
underlying mechanism.

169
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,680
So, why are we talking about this?

170
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,870
And in particular, why are
we talking about this during

171
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,740
an episode that includes a discussion

172
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,955
about eating disorders?

173
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:47,955
The reason is, nobody not the
government, no nutritionists,

174
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,970
no individual, no matter how knowledgeable

175
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,340
they are about food and
nutrition and food intake,

176
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,313
can define the best plan for
eating for any one individual.

177
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm going to repeat that.

178
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,500
Nobody knows what truly healthy eating is.

179
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,870
We only know the measurements
we can take, liver enzymes,

180
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,120
blood lipid profiles, body
weight, athletic performance,

181
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,140
mental performance, whether
or not you're cranky all day,

182
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,920
whether or not you're feeling relaxed,

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,430
nobody knows how to define these.

184
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,720
And these have strong
cultural and familial

185
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,230
and socio-societal influence.

186
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,960
So, if you hang out with people
that intermittent fast all

187
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,470
day, that will seem normal.

188
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,490
If you spend time with
people that have never heard

189
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,669
of intermittent fasting,

190
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,819
intermittent fasting is
going to seem very abnormal.

191
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,799
Now we are going to talk
about eating disorders

192
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,389
that really fall into the category

193
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,606
of clinically diagnosable
eating disorders,

194
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,848
for which there's actually
serious health hazards

195
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,852
and even the serious risk of death,

196
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:51,083
we will get to that topic.

197
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,683
But for the time being,

198
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:56,700
I want to emphasize a new set of findings

199
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,460
that I think many people
will find interesting.

200
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,670
And at least we'll want
to consider in light

201
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,350
of their current nutritional
plan or pattern of eating,

202
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,880
whether or not you're
intermittent fasting or not.

203
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,670
And I want to cue up
an important framework

204
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,610
for the rest of the
conversation on healthy

205
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,070
and disordered eating,

206
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,070
which includes an understanding
of thinking, decision-making

207
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,730
and what we call homeostatic processes,

208
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,680
meaning regulation of things
that are going on in our brain

209
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:26,642
and body and reward mechanisms.

210
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,140
So, I'm going to return
to that in a moment,

211
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,680
but first I want to share
with you these new findings

212
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,621
that were just published in
the Journal Cell Reports,

213
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:35,050
a Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

214
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,960
This was a study that was
performed both in mice

215
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,543
and it included a crossover
study with a human population.

216
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,630
The human population was women,

217
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,470
but it relates to a previous
study that was also carried

218
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,650
out in men.

219
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,850
I'm going to simplify this study.

220
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,440
We will provide a link to the
full study so you can explore

221
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,360
it in more detail.

222
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,190
And if you're really
excited about the results,

223
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,160
I would encourage you to
explore some of the references

224
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,543
within that paper as well.

225
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
What was the study?

226
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,800
The study looked at giving
mice or humans, two meals.

227
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,250
And explored whether or not
putting those meals early

228
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,410
in the day or late in the day,

229
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,620
had an impact on muscle hypertrophy,

230
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,440
muscle growth and overall
protein synthesis of muscle.

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,850
So, when we eat, the amino
acids from various foods

232
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,390
are broken down and synthesized

233
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,640
into different types of tissues.

234
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,120
They can be utilized for energy,

235
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,720
burned up for moving about
and thinking et cetera,

236
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,370
or it can be synthesize.

237
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,010
Those amino acids can be
synthesized into skeletal muscle.

238
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,490
The sorts of skeletal
muscles that allow you

239
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,772
to move your limbs.

240
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:45,772
This study explored how protein intake,

241
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,540
which included what are called
branch chain amino acids,

242
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
and amino acids, like leucine,

243
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,400
which are important for
muscle protein synthesis.

244
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,920
Explored whether or not emphasizing

245
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,870
or skewing the protein
intake toward early day

246
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,920
or late day was better in
terms of muscle hypertrophy.

247
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,970
And they also looked at
some parameters of strength,

248
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,870
like grip strength.

249
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,940
Now mice are nocturnal.

250
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,820
So, before you say wait,
mice are nocturnal,

251
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,860
how did they look during the day?

252
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,693
And it's completely,

253
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,380
it doesn't apply because it's in mice.

254
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,290
Of course they knew that.

255
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,330
And they looked during
the mice's active phase

256
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,880
of their circadian cycle,
which corresponds to our day.

257
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,170
And in humans, they looked
at whether or not eating

258
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,460
most of one's protein early in the day,

259
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,450
was better than if the protein intake

260
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,220
and the sprint chain amino acids

261
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,200
were placed later in the day.

262
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,260
And yes, they had the mice
do resistance training.

263
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,890
They did that by emphasizing
overload to one limb

264
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,000
of the mouse.

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,570
And that actually generates hypertrophy.

266
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,980
It's a form of resistance
training in mice.

267
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,520
So, they don't have them weight training.

268
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,030
They weren't doing curls
and dips and squats

269
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,000
and things of that sort.

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,350
They were moving their own body weight,

271
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,700
but they skewed that
distribution of body weight

272
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,959
by restricting a limb and
forcing them to use one limb

273
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,570
that did indeed grow in response to that.

274
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,510
And then in humans,

275
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,470
there was an exploration of grip strength.

276
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,290
And then with resistance
training that was also carried

277
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,840
out through a peripheral study.

278
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,970
Basically the takeaway from
this study was that mice

279
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,970
and humans can utilize amino
acids that are ingested early

280
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,980
in the day,

281
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,600
better than they can utilize
amino acids ingested later

282
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,070
in the day in particular
toward muscle hypertrophy

283
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,400
and growth or maintenance of muscle,

284
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,220
which for those of you
that aren't interested

285
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,970
in much muscle hypertrophy
that aren't trying

286
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,060
to grow your muscles.

287
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,100
I've talked before in the
episode on building strength

288
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,620
and hypertrophy, that maintaining muscle,

289
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,870
regardless of one's athletic prowess,

290
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,612
regardless of one's age
is extremely important

291
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:53,280
because loss of skeletal muscle

292
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,460
is one of the major causes of injury.

293
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,293
As we age.

294
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,126
It's one of the major causes,

295
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:01,900
believe it or not, of cognitive
and metabolic deficits

296
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,733
as we age.

297
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,830
So, maintaining muscle is important.

298
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,401
Building muscle might be
important to some of you,

299
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,350
but what they found was ingesting
protein early in the day.

300
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,233
And these amino acids early in the day,

301
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:15,730
led to more muscle hypertrophy
than if the majority

302
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,510
of amino acids and proteins
were ingested late in the day.

303
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,814
So, this translates to
intermittent fasting,

304
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:23,910
such that if you are interested
in muscle hypertrophy,

305
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,100
you might, and I want to emphasize,

306
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,040
might consider making sure
that you're getting sufficient

307
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,620
protein intake early in the day.

308
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,120
What sources of protein you use,

309
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,410
is going to be highly individual.

310
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,710
Some of you are meat eaters.

311
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,140
Some of you don't eat red meat.

312
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,678
Some of you eat chicken and fish and eggs.

313
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:40,950
Some of you don't, some of you are vegans.

314
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,450
It has been shown that the
amino acid leucine is vital

315
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,030
for the cell growth process,

316
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,410
including muscle growth,
because of its relationship

317
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,010
to the so-called mTOR pathway,

318
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,320
mammalian target of rapamycin.

319
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,390
We can talk about that more if
you like in a future episode,

320
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,130
this means that if you're
somebody who wants to maintain

321
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,473
or increase the amount of
muscle mass that you have,

322
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,940
ingesting a high protein
meal early in the day ought

323
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,940
to be beneficial for that.

324
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,980
Does it mean that you
should not eat protein

325
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,000
in the afternoon and evening?

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,833
No.

327
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,660
I think a lot of people might've
misinterpreted this study

328
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,173
and I don't want that to happen.

329
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,930
This is only pointing out the fact

330
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,330
that ingesting sufficient
quality amino acids,

331
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,780
including leucine, early in
the day can be beneficial

332
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,930
for maintenance and
growth of muscle tissue.

333
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,050
It does not say that you
should avoid protein later

334
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,030
in the day.

335
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,540
Now for you intermittent
fasters, this could be relevant.

336
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,373
I, for instance,

337
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:42,650
with somebody who for a very
long time skipped breakfast,

338
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,050
my first meal of the day would
be in the early afternoon,

339
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,890
mostly protein and salad,
in my case, animal protein.

340
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,810
'Cause that's in alignment with my values.

341
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,600
Then in the evening I would eat pasta,

342
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,480
vegetables, et cetera.

343
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,410
I might have some protein,

344
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,400
some small piece of fish or
chicken or something like that,

345
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,700
but I didn't really emphasize that.

346
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,240
On the basis of these results.

347
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
I am experimenting with.

348
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,200
I want to emphasize experimenting with,

349
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,780
I haven't completely
tossed out my old protocol,

350
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,740
but I'm experimenting with
eating proteins early in the day

351
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,060
and eating lunch.

352
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,650
And then dinner might be
light supper of some sort,

353
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,550
but not so much protein
later in the evening.

354
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,240
Again, if you want to eat six meals a day,

355
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,300
you want to eat round the clock.

356
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,170
I'm not going to stop you.

357
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,450
I'm not telling anybody what to do.

358
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,283
As I mentioned earlier,

359
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:29,370
nobody knows exactly how to
eat for one's particular goals.

360
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,830
But this study was really interesting,

361
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,610
because it really did
show that we can utilize

362
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,750
the proteins that are
ingested early in the day,

363
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,600
better than we can utilize
the proteins that are ingested

364
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:40,478
later in the day.

365
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:42,900
And of course there will be
factors that can shift that.

366
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,560
For instance, if you work out very hard

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,430
with resistance training later in the day,

368
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,295
resistance training is known
to increase protein synthesis.

369
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:52,660
So, it stands to reason
that ingesting amino acids

370
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,292
after that training would be beneficial.

371
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,120
However, in this study,

372
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,890
it did not seem to matter when
the resistance training fell

373
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,533
within the 24 hour schedule.

374
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,460
The morning ingestion
or early day ingestion

375
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,450
of amino acids seemed to be beneficial.

376
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,283
How early?

377
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,845
Between the hours of about 5:00 A.M.

378
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,614
and 10:00 A.M. for humans.

379
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:15,386
Now just a bit of mechanism
to explain why this happens.

380
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:18,642
So, why would it be that
ingesting protein early in the day

381
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:21,150
would lead to more synthesis of muscle

382
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,277
than ingesting protein later in the day?

383
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:25,810
And the reason it turns out is related

384
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,970
to the circadian clock mechanism

385
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,584
that is present in all cells,
including muscle cells.

386
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,110
So, muscles have fibers.

387
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,420
I think most people are aware of that,

388
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,110
that your muscles are not
just one big blob of tissue.

389
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,128
A lot of these little
fibers that contract.

390
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:41,092
Within those fibers, however,
there are cells with nuclei.

391
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:46,092
Those nuclei contained DNA.

392
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,670
DNA is transcribed into RNA.

393
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,403
RNA is translated into proteins.

394
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,500
The DNA of your cells,

395
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,840
including these muscle cells

396
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,920
are under strong circadian regulation.

397
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,600
Each one has a pattern of gene
expression that is different

398
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,060
at different times
during the 24 hour cycle,

399
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,010
this is an unescapable reality
of all cells in your body,

400
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,180
right from your hair
cells to your brain cells,

401
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,250
to your retinal cells,
to your toe on both feet.

402
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,970
These cells make a gene
called, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L

403
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,210
is a clock gene.

404
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,490
And the expression of
this clock gene varies

405
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,430
across the 24 hour cycle,

406
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,640
and proteins that are downstream

407
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,523
of this BMAL gene influence
protein synthesis.

408
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,700
The circadian regulation
of this BMAL gene turns

409
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,683
out to be vitally important

410
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:40,240
for this protein synthesis mechanism.

411
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,100
How do we know that?

412
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,670
Well, in this particular study,

413
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,190
because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,

414
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,860
the gene was knocked out,
they had bunch of these mice.

415
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,400
They were able to explore
whether or not this early day

416
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,820
feeding effect was present or absent

417
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,220
in these mice that lack the gene BMAL.

418
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,580
And indeed it was absent.

419
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,600
In other words,

420
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,350
the effect of increased protein
synthesis early in the day

421
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,183
was eliminated in the
absence of the BMAL gene.

422
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,790
So, what this means is that
when you wake up in the morning,

423
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,820
assuming you're following
a standard schedule

424
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,630
of being asleep at night
and awake during the day,

425
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,080
your muscle cells are primed
to incorporate amino acids

426
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,670
and synthesize muscle,

427
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,420
regardless of whether or
not you weight trained

428
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,110
the night before 8:00 P.M.,

429
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,300
or you don't weight train at all,

430
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,350
or you weight train afterwards or before.

431
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,320
I said five to 10:00 P.M.
is the sort of critical

432
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,760
window for this increased
protein synthesis.

433
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,229
All this means is that if you
are interested in maintaining

434
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:39,263
or enhancing muscle tissue volume,

435
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,840
that you might want to
consider eating quality,

436
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,330
protein and amino acids early in the day,

437
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,220
you could train first.

438
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,140
You could train after,
you can not train at all.

439
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,223
That's entirely different discussion.

440
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,770
What is quality protein,

441
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,690
well quality protein is
going to be a protein

442
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,450
that includes most of the
essential amino acids.

443
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,833
And in particular leucine.

444
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,770
Now, there's a lot of debate as to whether

445
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,210
or not you can get all
the essential amino acids

446
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,670
from a purely plant based diet

447
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,503
or whether or not you need

448
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:12,410
to ingest animal-based foods or not.

449
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,330
The term quality protein

450
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,345
has no strict scientific definition.

451
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:20,310
Some people define quality
protein as a protein

452
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,890
that has a high essential
amino acid to caloric ratio.

453
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,050
Now, what that means is,
a small piece of chicken

454
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,970
or steak or eggs for instance,

455
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,700
will have many essential amino acids

456
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,700
with a low caloric content
relative to say beans

457
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,500
or plant-based food that can also get

458
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,810
you essential amino acids,

459
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,480
but it requires more calories to access

460
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
those essential amino acids.

461
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,480
Now that's that has many
exceptions and nuances.

462
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,340
And I for one, and perfectly
respectful of the folks

463
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,670
that just want to ingest
plant-based foods in order to get

464
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,920
their high quality protein.

465
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,850
I think that actually can be done.

466
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,610
One has to be careful and
thoughtful in their choices

467
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,660
about how to do that.

468
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,700
So, this really isn't about animal based

469
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,460
versus non-animal based foods.

470
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,280
This is about getting quality
amino acids early in the day

471
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,900
from whatever foods are in
alignment with your particular

472
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,620
values in your particular eating plan.

473
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,640
So, that's a lot of information,

474
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,950
but the key takeaways are
every cell in your muscles

475
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,360
has a clock gene.

476
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,905
The clock genes vary such
that protein synthesis

477
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:30,460
is greater early in the day
than it is later in the day,

478
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,370
such that in both mice and in humans,

479
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,130
ingestion of quality proteins
early in the day will be more

480
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,700
so incorporated into muscle.

481
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,330
Than the proteins that are
ingested late in the day.

482
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,190
And of course there are the
caveats of if you're training

483
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,680
hard late in the day,

484
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,580
if you're adjusting your hormone status

485
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,605
through whatever mechanism et cetera,

486
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:54,960
protein synthesis can also
be high later in the day.

487
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,840
But for most people it's
going to taper off due

488
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,510
to this circadian BMAL
gene related mechanism.

489
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,820
Again, we will provide a link to the study

490
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,170
and the other key takeaways
were that nobody knows.

491
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,270
Nobody can tell you what
healthy feeding windows are,

492
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,760
what the best feeding windows are.

493
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,260
There's absolutely no
information in that context,

494
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,260
you talk to 10 nutritionists
or academics or trainers

495
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,650
or individuals about
what healthy eating is,

496
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,940
and you are going to get
vastly different answers.

497
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,640
And that's one of the
reasons why I believe

498
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,090
that the internet in
particular social media,

499
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,830
are so filled with contradictory opinions,

500
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,650
but the calories in versus
calories burned formula,

501
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,520
is that more or less holy
foundation of all things

502
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,245
about nutrition, eating and weight.

503
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:43,580
And as we transition
today into the discussion

504
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,750
about eating disorders,

505
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,600
I'd like you to keep this in
mind because for the treatment

506
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,640
of eating disorders,

507
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,222
it doesn't matter what psychological

508
00:21:52,222 --> 00:21:56,610
or early trauma based effects
led to the eating disorder.

509
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,560
If the person isn't adjusting
their feeding behavior

510
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,070
in a way that is going to
ameliorate the symptoms

511
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,910
of that disorder, which
is ultimately the goal.

512
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,440
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

513
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,360
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

514
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,540
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

515
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,210
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

516
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,140
and science related tools
to the general public.

517
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,230
In keeping with that theme,

518
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,200
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

519
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,903
Our first sponsor is Belcampo,

520
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,490
Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California

521
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,260
that raises organic grass fed

522
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,500
and finished certified humane meats.

523
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,547
I don't eat a lot of meat, but
I eat meat about once a day.

524
00:22:33,547 --> 00:22:38,547
That means a small piece of
steak or chicken, et cetera,

525
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:40,950
and usually a salad.

526
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,828
I usually do that for
breakfast or for lunch.

527
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,310
And then in the evening
I tend to follow a more

528
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,420
or less vegetarian diet.

529
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,420
I tend to eat pastas and
vegetables and things of that sort.

530
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,140
Well I don't eat a lot of meat.

531
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,158
It's important that the meat
that I eat be a very high

532
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:58,740
quality and that I am certain
that the animals were raised

533
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,100
and treated humanely up
until the point of slaughter.

534
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,170
Belcampo's animals, graze on open pastures

535
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,650
and seasonal grasses, their
entire lives resulting

536
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,742
in meat that's higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.

537
00:23:09,742 --> 00:23:12,260
It also results in healthy happy cows.

538
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,060
Often talk about how important
omega-3 fatty acids are.

539
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,840
They've been shown to be
important for regulating mood,

540
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,240
for the microbiome,

541
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,940
for restricting inflammation in the brain

542
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,370
and elsewhere in the body.

543
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,160
Belcampo's meats are known
to be high in omega threes.

544
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,370
And given that the meat is
grass fed and grass finished,

545
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,770
that combines all the
features of the nutrition

546
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,590
and the animal wellbeing
that I want to see

547
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,970
for any meat that I ingest.

548
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,390

Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.

554
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,040
Headspace is a meditation app.

555
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,350
That's backed by 25 published studies

556
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,350
and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

557
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,583
I've been meditating for a very long time.

558
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:05,970
Although I admit I meditate on and off,

559
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,040
meaning I'll go a few weeks or
months meditating regularly.

560
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,010
And then I tend to stop.

561
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,970
A few years ago, I got into
a regular meditation practice

562
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,320
because I started using
Headspace meditation app.

563
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,140
The thing I really like
about their meditation app

564
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,360
is it has meditations
of different durations.

565
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,510
So, sometimes I'll just
meditate for three minutes

566
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,343
or five minutes,

567
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,080
or ideally I'm doing two
20 minute sessions per day,

568
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,330
but I confess I don't always manage that,

569
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,250
but they have a ton of
different meditations

570
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,220
on the Headspace app that allow you

571
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,090
to tailor your meditation practice

572
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,100
to your particular schedule.

573
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,180
And there are now a plethora
of studies showing the benefits

574
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,530
of a regular meditation practice.

575
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,670
If you want to try Headspace,

576
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,920

go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

584
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,963
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

585
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:05,180
Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink,

586
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,480
and it's one that I've
been drinking since 2012.

587
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,006
The reason I started drinking
Athletic Greens and the reason

588
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:14,508
I still take Athletic Greens
is that it really helps me

589
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,030
cover all of my nutritional
basis with respect to vitamins

590
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,359
and minerals and probiotics.

591
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,450
And we now know that a
healthy gut microbiome

592
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,170
is supported by probiotics.

593
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,550
And for me,

594
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,210
Athletic Greens is the best
way to get those probiotics.

595
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,810
I also ingest some fermented foods,

596
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,490
but by ingesting Athletic Greens,

597
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,790
I'm certain to get all the things I need.

598
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,350
And also, I just feel
better when I drink it.

599
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,170
I genuinely feel like I have more energy

600
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,470
and I just feel better.

601
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,320
And I happen to really
like the way it tastes.

602
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,220
I mix mine with some water
and some lemon juice.

603
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,850
And in doing that, I'm certain
to get all my nutritional

604
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,210
basis covered and the probiotics support

605
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,530
a healthy gut microbiome,

606
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,170
which is important for mood,

607
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,910
regulating inflammation and so on.

608
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,290
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

609
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,200
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

610
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,690
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

611
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,220
They'll give you five free travel packs.

612
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,010
In addition to your Athletic Greens order,

613
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,630
those travel packs make it really easy

614
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,070
to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road,

615
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,620
in the car, on the plane, et cetera.

616
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,160
And they will give you a year supply

617
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,920
of vitamin D3, K2,

618
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,670
vitamin D3 and K2 have
been shown to be important

619
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,180
for blood lipid profiles for
metabolism and a whole bunch

620
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,420
of other metabolic and neural processes.

621
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,070
So, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

622
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,010
to get the Athletic Greens,

623
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,850
the five free travel
packs and the year supply

624
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,823
of D3 and K2.

625
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,570
So, let's talk about eating disorders.

626
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:34,120
And as we do that, I
want to emphasize again,

627
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,410
that nobody can really define
what healthy eating is,

628
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,660
with a single protocol.

629
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
However, there is some general agreement

630
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:44,370
about what unhealthy and
disordered eating is.

631
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,820
There are clear criteria
in the psychiatric

632
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,420
and psychological communities
to define things like anorexia

633
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,100
bulimia, binge eating disorder,

634
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,830
all of which we will talk about,

635
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,040
but as we have that discussion,

636
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,580
I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis

637
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,950
can be both a terrific, but
also a very precarious thing.

638
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,700
We talked about this a
little bit in the episode

639
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,590
about depression, there's always
a temptation as one learns

640
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,860
about the symptomology
of a given disorder.

641
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,190
It doesn't really matter
what the disorder is,

642
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,023
to ask the question.

643
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,260
Well, do I have that?

644
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,006
Does so-and-so that I know have that, ah,

645
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:20,724
I see this sort of behavior
or that pattern of thinking.

646
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:24,687
In that individual, it's
tempting to diagnose them

647
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:27,180
and or ourselves as either having or not

648
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,490
having a particular disorder.

649
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,350
However, diagnoses really need
to be carried out by people

650
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,380
who are trained in that particular field,

651
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,620
and that have deep
expertise in recognizing

652
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,460
the symptomology, including some

653
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,360
of the more subtle symptomology
of eating disorders.

654
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,723
So, if any of the symptoms
resonate with you,

655
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,350
by way of you thinking

656
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,180
that you have this particular
disorder or someone that,

657
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,000
you know, has this disorder,
I would take that seriously,

658
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,760
but I would take that information

659
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,730
to a qualified healthcare
professional that could diagnose

660
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,430
or rule out any of these
possible disorders.

661
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,843
I say that not to protect us,

662
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:08,380
but to protect you, because
information is valuable.

663
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,080
And I do believe that
knowledge of knowledge

664
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,840
can be very valuable
in navigating any topic

665
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,324
and improving our thoughts and
behaviors around that topic.

666
00:28:15,324 --> 00:28:18,840
But one doesn't want to, or I should say,

667
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,070
one, shouldn't start to
self-diagnose simply on the basis

668
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,970
of information without running
that through the filter

669
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,750
of a qualified professional.

670
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,990
So, what is an eating disorder?

671
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,243
Well, we have to take a step back,

672
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:35,690
and confess to the fact that
every society, every culture,

673
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,700
every family, and every individual

674
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,350
has a different relationship to food,

675
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,780
eating disorders, however,
have particular criteria

676
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,750
that allow us to define them and to think

677
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,220
about different modes of treatment.

678
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,380
As it relates to the particular
symptoms and particular,

679
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,650
the psychological and biological symptoms

680
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,483
of those disorders.

681
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,329
Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended.

682
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:00,923
What are the major eating disorders?

683
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,660
Anorexia nervosa, most commonly
referred to as anorexia

684
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,410
is perhaps the most prevalent
and the most dangerous

685
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,130
of all eating disorders.

686
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,310
In fact, anorexia is the most
dangerous psychiatric disorder

687
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,563
of all, even more than depression.

688
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,650
The probability of death
for untreated anorexia

689
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,970
is very high, and sadly the prevalence

690
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,930
of anorexia is very high.

691
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,743
So, what is anorexia
and how prevalent is it?

692
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:36,140
Anorexia, if you look
it up online or you talk

693
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,910
to a qualified professional,
is essentially a failure

694
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,463
to eat enough, to
maintain a healthy weight.

695
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,030
You can see all sorts of very
troubling symptoms of somebody

696
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,423
who's been anorexic for
some period of time,

697
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,540
a general loss of muscle mass
because they're ingesting

698
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,580
fewer calories than they burn.

699
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,470
Muscle is very metabolically active.

700
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,890
They tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.

701
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,060
They will have a low heart rate.

702
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,670
This is the body and brain's
attempt to lower energy output.

703
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,290
They will have low blood pressure.

704
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,950
They'll sometimes have
symptoms like fainting.

705
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,220
They will have sometimes
even hair growth on the face,

706
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,850
something called lanugo,

707
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,010
which is essentially the body's attempt

708
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,560
to insulate the body because
of loss of body heat.

709
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,713
When you're that thin.

710
00:30:25,787 --> 00:30:26,900
Loss of bone density,

711
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,880
osteoporosis, loss of
periods in girls and women,

712
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,880
and all sorts of disrupted
gut and immune functions.

713
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,040
So, there are just tons
of terrible symptoms

714
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,730
of anorexia that really
placed the anorexic

715
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,730
into a very risky state,
which is why mortality

716
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:51,820
from anorexia gone
untreated is extremely high.

717
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,700
Now, one of the
misconceptions about anorexia,

718
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,090
is that it stems from an
overemphasis on perfectionism,

719
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,310
or that because of all
the images in social media

720
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,750
and in advertising of
extremely thin and fit

721
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,760
or muscular people that
individuals are looking

722
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,100
at themselves and comparing
themselves to those images

723
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,630
and thinking that they don't match up

724
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,838
and developing anorexia,

725
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:21,160
that turns out to not be the case.

726
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,920
If you look at the prevalence
or the rates of anorexia,

727
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,270
in the last 10 years or 20 years,

728
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,750
and you compare that to when
anorexia was first identified,

729
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,140
which was in the 1600s,
and perhaps even earlier,

730
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,550
what you find is that rates
of anorexia are not going up.

731
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,240
So, this idea that the images
that we're being bombarded

732
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,190
with are causing anorexia
doesn't seem to be true.

733
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,170
Now, that is not to say that the images

734
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,569
that we in particular young
people are being bombarded

735
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:52,970
with are healthy for the
psychological state of mind.

736
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,280
But classically define anorexia
has existed at essentially

737
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,170
the same prevalence for the last 100, 200,

738
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,680
300 and 400 years,

739
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,600
which is incredible and really
speaks to the likelihood

740
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,460
that there's a strong
biological contribution

741
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,120
to what we call anorexia nervosa.

742
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,860
Anorexia nervosa is extremely common.

743
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,790
It's anywhere from one to 2% of women.

744
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,060
And the typical onset is in
adolescence close to puberty,

745
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,960
but it can show up later in life as well.

746
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,180
In fact, the identification
and diagnosis of anorexia tends

747
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,470
to be in the early '20s.

748
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,560
But if you look back at the
history of those individuals,

749
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,660
there were typically signs
of anorexia that back

750
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,630
into their early teens.

751
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,063
Or maybe even before that.

752
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:45,440
Now, of course, men can
be anorexic as well,

753
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,670
but anorexia nervosa does seem
to occur at 10 times the rate

754
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,610
in women and young girls,

755
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,100
than it does in men and young boys.

756
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,210
So, while there does seem to be more

757
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,220
of a prevalence of anorexia
in boys and young men,

758
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,260
these days, that's probably
due to better diagnosis

759
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,470
and detection than it is to some sort

760
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,070
of societal shift related
to imagery, et cetera.

761
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,180
Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia

762
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,540
and some of the images
that are present in media

763
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,400
and social media and how those
are impacting other forms

764
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,233
of eating disorders.

765
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,470
But when you look at anorexia nervosa,

766
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,350
this failure to maintain weight,

767
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,320
even to healthy levels
and often drops in weight

768
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,840
that are very dangerous or even deadly,

769
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,550
that has existed for a very long time,

770
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,270
and seems to be somewhat
hardwired into the biology

771
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,600
of individuals that suffer from it.

772
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,640
Now, when I say hard wired,

773
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,130
that doesn't mean that it
can't be treated or cured,

774
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,333
and indeed it can.

775
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:48,640
Bulimia which is defined as
binge eating or overeating.

776
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
Let me explain what that is.

777
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,160
Binge eating is consuming
vast amounts of calories

778
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,570
in a short period of time.

779
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,190
Overeating can be ingesting
more calories than one needs,

780
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,360
but over an extended period of time,

781
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,050
both can exist of course, but
bulimia is also very common.

782
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,990
It's more common in young girls

783
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,260
and in women that it is
in young boys and in men,

784
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,543
but it is present in both sexes.

785
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,949
Bulimia and rates of
bulimia might be increasing.

786
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,419
That's sort of an interesting finding.

787
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,320
It's not quite clear
whether or not it's existed

788
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,280
in its same form for a long period of time

789
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,790
or within other new forms that
are evolving or showing up,

790
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,437
we're going to drill into bulimia

791
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,518
and what it actually is
and what it represents.

792
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:37,670
But one thing I want to be clear about,

793
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,290
just as the perfectionist
mindset has been associated

794
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,303
with anorexia, and it turns
out that's not the case.

795
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,283
It can be, but it's not always
associated with anorexia.

796
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,959
There was the idea that
bulimia is associated

797
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,550
with early trauma in childhood,
in particular sexual trauma.

798
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,720
And while that can be the case,

799
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,690
there's no direct
correlation between the two.

800
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,200
Now, obviously psychological
phenomena and trauma

801
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,070
can have a profound impact on the way

802
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,170
that the brain wires up and the way

803
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,480
that people approach food
and other types of behaviors.

804
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,270
But the sort of classic
idea was that all anorexics

805
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,780
are perfectionists, they
want to perform well.

806
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,900
It's all about control and autonomy.

807
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,500
And bulimics are kind of
dysregulated and acting

808
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,562
out against some early sexual trauma,

809
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:29,562
those stereotypes of the
psychological framework

810
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,220
of anorexics and
bulimics, doesn't hold up.

811
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,700
When you look at the data, many,

812
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,990
many meta analysis have been done.

813
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,780
It just simply is not the case.

814
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,200
And in both instances,
both anorexia and bulimia,

815
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,720
there are clear biological underpinnings,

816
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,300
to what's driving the
under-eating or the overeating.

817
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,310
So, we're going to talk about
the biology of under eating

818
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,730
and overeating and
appropriate levels of eating.

819
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,770
And by doing that,

820
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,280
we will start to identify
some of the mechanisms

821
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,630
that serve as entry
points for the treatment

822
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,563
of both anorexia and bulimia.

823
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:07,200
And as some of you are probably aware,

824
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,640
anorexia and bulimia can be comorbid,

825
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,140
they can exist with one another.

826
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,180
There are anorexics who
will binge and then purge

827
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,623
in order to maintain that
unhealthily low weight.

828
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,630
There are bulimics

829
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,601
who fit the psychological
criteria of anorexia.

830
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,820
And so there's a lot of overlap

831
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,480
between those two categories.

832
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,430
Now let's talk about the
categorization for a second and why

833
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,060
the categorization has led to now a bunch

834
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,170
of other eating disorders as defined

835
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,270
by the psychiatric community.

836
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,910
One of the classic symptoms of anorexia

837
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,400
is a loss of menstrual
cycles, loss of periods.

838
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,620
And the reason for that is when
the body is undernourished,

839
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:52,020
the body fat stores,
send signals to the brain

840
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,440
to inform that the body is undernourished,

841
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,470
or they turn off the
signals that say, look,

842
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,880
there are enough body fat cells out here

843
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,160
to support healthy metabolism.

844
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,073
And therefore let's shut down ovulation,

845
00:37:04,073 --> 00:37:07,260
literally signal sent
from the fat and muscle

846
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,070
to the brain and the brain,

847
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,370
the hypothalamus and pituitary
will send signals down

848
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,239
to the ovaries,

849
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,660
or they will turn off the
signals heading to the ovaries

850
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,930
to deploy eggs,

851
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,760
to maturation of eggs in
the follicle, et cetera.

852
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,760
So, there are instances in
which people have anorexia

853
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,770
or have bulimia,

854
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,640
but are still maintaining
healthy menstrual cycles

855
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,990
or at least menstrual cycles.

856
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,900
And that has led to a whole
set of other categorizations

857
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
of eating disorders, like
binge eating disorder,

858
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,070
where there tends to
be a lot of overeating,

859
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:45,074
but not the purging or
categorizations of anorexia,

860
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,100
in which people are under feeding,

861
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,010
but they are not losing their periods.

862
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,810
And so these have a number of
different names and acronyms.

863
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,480
Some of them include things like, EDNOS,

864
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,990
EDNOS is eating disorder,
not otherwise specified.

865
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:02,413
So, that's a sub categorization or OSFEDs.

866
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:06,450
So, OSFEDs is or specified
feeding or eating disorder.

867
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,580
So, right now,

868
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,280
if you were to look
online or you're looking

869
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,240
to the psychiatric and
psychological textbooks,

870
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,260
what you would find is that
there's a huge constellation

871
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,210
of eating disorders today.

872
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,630
We're mainly going to talk about anorexia,

873
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,420
bulimia, binge eating
disorder and body dysmorphia.

874
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,000
You can even find eating
disorders like pica,

875
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,100
where people actually ingest
things like dirt or rocks

876
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,810
or metal because they
have a genuine appetite

877
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,643
for those things.

878
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,630
I certainly do not recommend sampling any

879
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,120
of those non food items.

880
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,620
As foods, is incredibly dangerous.

881
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,520
People often poisoned themselves.

882
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,090
They often can cause structural blockages

883
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,640
some people have died from
those sorts of things.

884
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,010
But nonetheless, there
are aspects of our brain

885
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,970
and biology that when disrupted can lead

886
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,700
to very bizarre types of eating behavior,

887
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,190
sometimes pica is caused by
malnutrition, but not always.

888
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,920
And so today we're going to focus

889
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,020
on the most prevalent eating disorders,

890
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,520
but we are going to build
up toward that understanding

891
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,600
by looking at what healthy
metabolism and eating

892
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,010
and satiety and hunger looks like.

893
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,130
Because one, I realized that not everyone

894
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,700
out there has an eating disorder.

895
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,045
And two, I want people to
understand this relationship

896
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:21,970
between how they think,
the decisions they take

897
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,090
about what they eat

898
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,650
and how the body and the
brain at subconscious levels

899
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,350
are driving some of these
behaviors healthy or otherwise.

900
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,760
Because I do think that
it can lead us to a better

901
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,080
understanding of what healthy
eating is for most of us,

902
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,040
and to increase compassion and hopefully

903
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,080
even increased improvement in
treatment of eating disorders

904
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,150
for those that are suffering from them.

905
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,230
So, what is hunger and what is satiety?

906
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,130
Satiety, of course being sated

907
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,373
or feeling like we've had enough food.

908
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,770
I want to remind people
of the basic mechanisms

909
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,680
by which the brain and body communicate.

910
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,070
This is vitally important,
not just for this discussion,

911
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,170
but for any discussion, about
how we think, how we behave,

912
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,680
how we feel, the body is
communicating two types

913
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,720
of information to the
brain on a regular basis,

914
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,792
but in particular around
feeding, and those two types

915
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,708
of information are mechanical information,

916
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:18,840
and chemical information.

917
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,400
What do I mean by mechanical information?

918
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,200
Well, if you take a deep breath, oh,

919
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,240
and you hold your breath,

920
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,610
what you'll find is that
you can hold your breath

921
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,040
a lot longer than if
you exhale all your air

922
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,790
and you hold your breath with lungs empty.

923
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,910
And the reason is not because
when your lungs are full,

924
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,400
you have enough oxygen

925
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,810
and therefore you can hold your breath.

926
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,300
It's because when your lungs are full,

927
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,230
a particular class of
neurons called baroreceptors,

928
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,240
send information to the brain and say,

929
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,400
there's pressure in the lungs.

930
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,700
And that means that there's
probably oxygen in here.

931
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,490
And so the trigger to breathe
is actually suppressed,

932
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,760
when your lungs are empty.

933
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,230
Even if you have plenty
of oxygen in your system,

934
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,610
those baroreceptors send a
different signal to the brain,

935
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,630
which is there's no oxygen in
here and you should breathe.

936
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,470
And so the impulse to
breathe comes earlier.

937
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,360
Likewise, when your stomach is full,

938
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,750
it sends signals to your
brain that are purely based

939
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,740
on this mechanical fullness,

940
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,060
has nothing to do with
nutrients, that says I'm full.

941
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,730
And therefore don't be as hungry.

942
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,500
Don't motivate to find or ingest food.

943
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,300
Whereas when our gut is empty,

944
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,280
even if we have plenty of nutrients

945
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,300
or plenty of body fat stores,

946
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,900
we tend to focus on food a bit more.

947
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,680
So, volume and mechanical
influences have a profound effect

948
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,750
on how we think.

949
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,650
And what consider doing or not doing,

950
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,870
likewise chemical effects.

951
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,220
When we ingest food,

952
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,325
our so-called blood sugar or
blood glucose levels go up.

953
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:44,500
That information is signaled to the brain

954
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,980
via neuronal pathways
and hormonal pathways.

955
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,450
And in particular, there
are neurons within our gut,

956
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,960
that signal to areas of our
brain stem that are involved

957
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,180
in satiety in our sense of having enough

958
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,440
that there's food in our system.

959
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,530
So, that's chemical information.

960
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:05,530
So, how our hunger and
feeding and satiety regulated

961
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,833
by way of mechanical
and chemical signaling.

962
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,820
You have, I have,

963
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,310
we all have neurons in our
hypothalamus that trigger eating

964
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,800
and neurons that trigger
cessation or stopping of eating.

965
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,423
We have an accelerator on
eating and we have a break.

966
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:24,550
And I covered all of this in
a lot of detail in the episode

967
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,720
on feeding and metabolism and hunger.

968
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,800
So, if you want a lot more
detail, see that episode,

969
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,633
but right now,

970
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,110
I'm just going to give you the top contour

971
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,090
of how all that works.

972
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,140
Your hypothalamus is an
area of your forebrain,

973
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,970
which tells you it's in the front,

974
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,180
but it's at the base of your
forebrain sits more or less

975
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,440
above the roof of your mouth.

976
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,550
The hypothalamus contains
lots of different kinds

977
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,970
of neurons, including neurons
that stimulate sexual activity

978
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,495
and desire, regulate your body temperature

979
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:54,495
and control appetite and
ceasing of eating and appetite.

980
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,260
There are two types of neurons
within a particular area

981
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,230
of your hypothalamus
that are relevant here.

982
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,760
There are the so-called
POMC neurons, okay?

983
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
that tend to act as more

984
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,620
of a break on appetite,

985
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,080
by way of another hormone

986
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,830
called melanocytes stimulating hormone.

987
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,230
And not so incidentally
when you're getting

988
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,300
a lot of sunlight and you're
viewing a lot of sunlight,

989
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,210
that system is ramped up.

990
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,703
This is why appetite is
lower in the summer months

991
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,480
than it is in the winter months.

992
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,211
This is true in animals.

993
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:30,880
And this is true in humans.

994
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,060
And you have a class of neurons
called the AgRP neurons.

995
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,730
The AgRP neurons are the
ones that stimulate feeding,

996
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,680
and they create a sort of
anxiety or excitement about food,

997
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,530
can be positive anxiety, or
it can be negative anxiety.

998
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,490
What do I mean by that?

999
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,910
Well, if you ever seen kids
heading in to get ice cream,

1000
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,230
they're absolutely excited.

1001
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,440
You see people getting raised,
sit down and eat a big meal.

1002
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,530
They're excited to eat.

1003
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,340
Sometimes that's due to social factors,

1004
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,660
but they have an increase
in overall levels

1005
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,569
of autonomic arousal.

1006
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:02,680
And depending on the context,

1007
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,310
they can feel excited or anxious,

1008
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,370
but it is a ramping up of energy.

1009
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:09,530
These AgRP neurons are what caused that,

1010
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,556
in fact so much so that if you eliminate

1011
00:44:11,556 --> 00:44:14,740
or kill these neurons, which has been done

1012
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,860
in experimental mouse
models in the laboratory,

1013
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,810
but also there are
humans that have lesions

1014
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,050
or neurotoxic effects
on these AgRP neurons.

1015
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,008
And what you find is that
they don't want to eat.

1016
00:44:25,008 --> 00:44:26,500
They essentially become anorexic,

1017
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,083
meaning they don't want to ingest food.

1018
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,270
They have no appetite for food whatsoever.

1019
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,440
Now that's not exactly what anorexia is,

1020
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,880
but these AgRP neurons
are like an accelerator

1021
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,950
on wanting to eat.

1022
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,640
Whereas if you stimulate
these AgRP neurons

1023
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,580
or in humans that have
say a small tumor near

1024
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,950
these AgRP neurons,
they become hyperphagic.

1025
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,090
They will eat to the point of bursting,

1026
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,820
both animals and humans
that have elevated levels

1027
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,700
of these AgRP neurons are anxious.

1028
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,700
They want to eat,

1029
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,680
and they will ingest food to
the point where they override

1030
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,800
those mechanical and
chemical signals in the body.

1031
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,210
And I know it sounds
horrible, and it is horrible.

1032
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,140
They will eat until the
point that they burst.

1033
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,320
Now, there are signals
coming back from the body

1034
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,210
to inform the brain about presence

1035
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,130
of different levels of nutrients.

1036
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,470
And that generally comes
from three sources.

1037
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,760
First of all, is body fat.

1038
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,080
The more body fat we have,

1039
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,790
the more we secrete a hormone
called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N,

1040
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,350
leptin from body fat,

1041
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,741
leptin goes to the brain
and suppresses appetite.

1042
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:30,780
This is a body to brain signaling
mechanism that says, look,

1043
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,630
I've had enough,

1044
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,530
not incidentally, leptin
signaling is disrupted

1045
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,720
in people that have bulimia and obesity

1046
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,490
and certain forms of
binge eating disorder.

1047
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,050
So, that system has disrupted
they have had enough signal

1048
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,690
or there's enough body fat
here such that you don't need

1049
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:51,300
to eat more right here,
I'm sort of in the voice

1050
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,200
of the body fat, trying to
talk to the brain, that signal,

1051
00:45:55,483 --> 00:45:56,316
that dialogue is mixed up or messed up.

1052
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:58,380
In some cases it's absent entirely.

1053
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,820
So, the body fat is signaling to the brain

1054
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,820
about how much reserve you have.

1055
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,807
It's sort of like a
savings account for energy,

1056
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:06,560
'cause that's what body fat is.

1057
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,193
You've got lipids in there
and through lipolysis,

1058
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:09,500
that can be metabolized.

1059
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,404
If you're interested in that process,

1060
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:13,410
both how to increase it.

1061
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,290
And just generally how it works.

1062
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,685
You can see the episode on
the science of fat loss.

1063
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:20,500
The body fat is doing something
else really interesting

1064
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,890
that relates to anorexia,

1065
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,830
when they're sufficient levels of body fat

1066
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,270
and leptin circulating in the blood.

1067
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,970
And that leptin signal gets to the brain,

1068
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,520
the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland

1069
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,500
register that signal.

1070
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,460
And in a completely subconscious way,

1071
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,460
trigger the deployment of eggs
in females and the production

1072
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,950
of sperm in males.

1073
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,180
So, when body fat stores are very low,

1074
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,220
the reason why periods shut
off or sperm production

1075
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,520
is reduced or even shut off
is because there's not enough

1076
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,700
leptin getting to the
hypothalamus and to the pituitary.

1077
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,500
And they shut off the
signals, the hormones,

1078
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,160
things like
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

1079
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,400
luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone,

1080
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,233
all these hormones.

1081
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:06,120
So, you don't have to remember the names

1082
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,260
of if you don't want to
that travel to the ovary

1083
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,860
or to the testes and
cause the ovary and testes

1084
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,600
to ovulate or to produce more sperm.

1085
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,453
So, the reason why anorexic
stopped having periods,

1086
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,660
while they stopped cycling,

1087
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,060
is because there isn't sufficient
leptin in the bloodstream.

1088
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:28,540
Now there have been attempts
to give leptin to anorexics

1089
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,550
because leptin has been
sequenced and the peptide

1090
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,670
has been synthesized.

1091
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,262
And so you can inject leptin into people.

1092
00:47:35,262 --> 00:47:37,520
There are studies where they've done that,

1093
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,130
when that happens, it
does not tend to alleviate

1094
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,404
the anorexia, does not cause

1095
00:47:43,404 --> 00:47:44,840
people to start eating again.

1096
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,920
And that actually makes sense
because leptin is also a way

1097
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,350
of shutting off the hunger signals saying,

1098
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,890
it's the body fats way of saying, hey,

1099
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:52,900
there's a lot of body fat here,

1100
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,160
or there is sufficient body fat.

1101
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,990
There doesn't even have
to be a lot, but it has,

1102
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,990
in some cases been shown
to rescue the menstrual,

1103
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,470
cycling in some anorexics, okay?

1104
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,810
So, body fat is signaling to the brain.

1105
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,340
The gut is signaling to the brain.

1106
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,630
There are neurons in your gut
that are primarily responding

1107
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,410
to meaning they fire electrical signals.

1108
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:14,710
When there are sufficient
fatty acids coming

1109
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,660
from fats you ingest, amino acids coming

1110
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,370
from proteins you ingest and sugars coming

1111
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,940
from carbohydrates and sugars.

1112
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,990
Things like fructose, glucose, et cetera.

1113
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,270
Those signals are being sent
from the fat and from the gut

1114
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,010
up to the brain.

1115
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,380
And therefore your body
has multiple signals

1116
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,530
of directing you toward
eating more or eating less.

1117
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,130
So, you've got two categories of neurons.

1118
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,070
One that acts as an accelerator,
the AgRP neuron saying,

1119
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,853
eat, eat, and get you excited to eat.

1120
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,540
And then you have a category of neurons.

1121
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,890
The POMC neurons that
are suppressing hunger.

1122
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,000
They're acting like a break,
and the body is informing

1123
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,670
the brain all the time about the status

1124
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,830
of the body and whether or
not it needs more food or not.

1125
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,440
So, you might ask why is it
that people who are overweight

1126
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,990
and have a lot of body fat,

1127
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,740
why they would continue to eat a lot,

1128
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,260
well past a certain
threshold of body fat that's

1129
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,657
when you start getting

1130
00:49:09,657 --> 00:49:10,920
into these so-called metabolic disorders,

1131
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,010
where blood glucose
metabolism is disrupted,

1132
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,050
leptin signaling is disrupted
and there are all sorts

1133
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:19,760
of changes on both the
brain side and the body end

1134
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,240
of things, such that they're hungry,

1135
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,340
despite the fact that the body has plenty

1136
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,260
of energy on reserve.

1137
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,880
Okay, that I think is
sufficient to explain the basics

1138
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,990
of hunger and satiety are kind
of a biological mechanism.

1139
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,910
And the important thing again,

1140
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,710
to remember is that they're
mechanical and chemical signals

1141
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,050
that come from fullness
or absence of fullness

1142
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,930
that come in the presence
of glucose in the blood

1143
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,960
or the absence of glucose in the blood.

1144
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,400
When you haven't eaten for a long time,

1145
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,590
glucagon levels go up, for instance,

1146
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,540
GLP1 levels go up and those will drive you

1147
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,041
to seek out food and want food.

1148
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:54,670
And then there are the signals
that are coming from body fat

1149
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,040
and from neurons in the gut.

1150
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,800
So, there's a lot of convergence,
in a lot of pathways.

1151
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,120
I don't offer you all those
pathways to confuse you.

1152
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,380
I offer you those pathways
to clarify the extent

1153
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,230
to which something as simple
as eating or the decision

1154
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,580
to not eat is complicated.

1155
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,020
We've perhaps heard,

1156
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,650
or I've certainly heard
that, oh, you know,

1157
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,490
it takes about 20 minutes
for satiety to set in,

1158
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,995
so you should eat slowly that
you won't realize that you're

1159
00:50:19,995 --> 00:50:22,520
full until about 20 minutes.

1160
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,840
That's actually not true.

1161
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,960
I don't know where that got started,

1162
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,910
but we should probably
all chew our food better

1163
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,280
and eat more slowly,

1164
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,820
be more mindful of what
we're eating, et cetera.

1165
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,240
So, in anticipation of this episode,

1166
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,310
I consulted extensively with a colleague

1167
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,143
of mine at Stanford,

1168
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:40,640
who sadly for us is going off
to University of Pennsylvania.

1169
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,230
So, our losses University
of Pennsylvania's win.

1170
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,130
His name is Dr. Casey Halpern.

1171
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,840
He's a MD, Medical
Doctor and Neurosurgeon,

1172
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,300
and a PhD who studies
binge-eating disorder

1173
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,980
and other types of eating
disorders and how they arise

1174
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,840
in the brain.

1175
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,106
And he's developed some

1176
00:50:57,106 --> 00:51:00,110
really pioneering treatments for them.

1177
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,860
We'll talk more about his
work a little bit later

1178
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,470
in the episode, but we
got to the discussion

1179
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:09,470
of why a body that has
sufficient energy levels

1180
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,517
would desire to eat more at all.

1181
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:15,470
And this is not just the case
for binge eating disorder

1182
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,780
for bulimia, but why
that would be the case.

1183
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,560
You know, this is primitive biology

1184
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,230
that evolved over many tens.

1185
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,270
If not hundreds of thousands
of years, you see it in mice,

1186
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,350
you see it in humans,

1187
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,380
very similar types of
pathways and effects.

1188
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,690
How is it that human
beings who have plenty

1189
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,160
of fat on reserve and plenty of glycogen

1190
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,760
in their liver, et cetera.

1191
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,760
In other words, plenty of
energy, why they would be hungry,

1192
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,280
why they would eat at all.

1193
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,960
It seems like that just shouldn't happen.

1194
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,450
And he had a very important,

1195
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,550
and I think clear and intuitive way

1196
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,400
of framing up all this stuff around eating

1197
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,260
and motivated behaviors
and how they can go awry,

1198
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,610
not just in eating
disorders, but in all of us.

1199
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:01,910
Basically what he said was,
from an evolutionary standpoint,

1200
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,680
it makes sense that we should
eat as often as we can,

1201
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,733
as much as we can, and as fast as we can.

1202
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,550
Well, that sounds crazy.

1203
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,370
I've was told to eat not
too often, not too much,

1204
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,820
and to eat slowly and chew my food.

1205
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,010
But as Dr. Halpern pointed out,

1206
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,230
there are circuits in the
brain to reward eating

1207
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:28,170
often eating fast and
cramming as much food

1208
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,400
into you as possible.

1209
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,223
Because from a purely
evolutionary standpoint,

1210
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,490
food was scarce, and
seeking food was dangerous,

1211
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,990
whether or not it was from
animal sources or not.

1212
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,600
And it's always been competitive,
for those of you that grew

1213
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,130
up in families with a lot of siblings.

1214
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,490
This may resonate with you.

1215
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,833
I just one sibling,

1216
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:49,046
we were competitive about certain things,

1217
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:50,450
but typically not competitive about food,

1218
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,790
but I had friends that
had a lot of siblings.

1219
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,620
It was really interesting to
see how food was served up

1220
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,000
and how it was taken in those households.

1221
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,500
It was like food would hit
the table and it was just

1222
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,750
an absolute war for
portions and who got what

1223
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,010
and how much and who got
a slightly bigger piece

1224
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,130
of cake, et cetera,

1225
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:14,040
turned out to be a frequent
happening in these meals

1226
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,640
and that these birthday parties,

1227
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:19,291
whereas the only children
perhaps were used

1228
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,860
to having more food presented
to them without having

1229
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,456
to compete with other
members of the species.

1230
00:53:22,456 --> 00:53:27,430
Every animal, including
humans has a hardwired circuit

1231
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,120
that we were born with that pays attention

1232
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,530
to how much food is available,
how much we are getting now

1233
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,320
and how much we are likely
to get in the future.

1234
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,520
And without going down the rabbit hole

1235
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,520
of arcuate nucleus
biology, in two sentences,

1236
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,000
you have a hypothalamic area
called the arcuate nucleus.

1237
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,260
It's a fascinating area.

1238
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,020
It's actually the area that houses,

1239
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,480
these PMOC neurons and
these other types of neurons

1240
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,673
that regulate hunger and satiety.

1241
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:57,120
And these neurons

1242
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,700
in the arcuate nucleus
start getting active.

1243
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,270
When we see food and think about food,

1244
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,950
they drive hunger, and they drive hunger

1245
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,000
in a way that's responsive
to what the food looks like,

1246
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,500
what it smells like,

1247
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,150
but also our prior history of
interactions with that food.

1248
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,340
And it takes into account social context,

1249
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,100
whether or not we are going
to get the whole pizza

1250
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,250
to ourselves or whether or not
there are going to be others

1251
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,760
that we are going to have to compete with.

1252
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,876
So, there are a lot of signals
that this arcuate nucleus

1253
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:29,620
in your brain are paying attention to.

1254
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,110
So, Dr. Halpern pointed
out that you actually

1255
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,190
have an accelerator that
increases your level of awareness

1256
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,570
and anxiety and sort

1257
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,580
of constricts your field of
view and all your senses.

1258
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,070
Anytime you interact
with food and is driving

1259
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,220
a primitive reflex to ingest
as much food as you can,

1260
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,150
as quickly as you can,

1261
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,710
and then move on from there,

1262
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,160
and presumably to do the same elsewhere.

1263
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,387
So, that changed the way that
I think about eating behavior

1264
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:58,200
and eating disorders.

1265
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,570
In fact, we could think about
eating disorders like bulimia

1266
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,800
as an unmasking of that mechanism

1267
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,570
without the so-called top-down control,

1268
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:09,350
without the mechanisms that we
use to regulate our behavior.

1269
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:12,450
And indeed bulimia and
binge-eating disorder

1270
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,780
are closely associated with impulsivity

1271
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,830
and with impulsive
behaviors of other kinds,

1272
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,820
something that we also will discuss more.

1273
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,710
What's the pathway?

1274
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,543
How does this work?

1275
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:26,630
What is Dr. Halpern and his
colleagues doing in order

1276
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,940
to try and treat things
like binge eating disorder?

1277
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:33,940
Well, you can frame all of behavior,

1278
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,950
good decision making
and bad decision-making.

1279
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,820
In a pretty simple box diagram model.

1280
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,750
And I realized that many of
you are listening to this,

1281
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,760
not watching this.

1282
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,140
There is no diagram to look at.

1283
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,650
I'll just explain it so
that you can conceptualize

1284
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,483
it in your mind.

1285
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,610
We have knowledge of what we
should do, in one box, okay?

1286
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,520
We should eat that.

1287
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,490
We shouldn't eat that.

1288
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,390
We should wait for dinner.

1289
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,540
We shouldn't wait for dinner.

1290
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:02,050
And then we have what we
actually do in another box, okay?

1291
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,580
Now this is true for all behaviors,

1292
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,120
we should say something or
we want to say something,

1293
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,730
but we don't, we shouldn't say
something, but we do anyway.

1294
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,730
That's the knowledge that
kind of looping in your head.

1295
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:13,598
I should do my homework.

1296
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:14,450
I should go for a run.

1297
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:15,880
I shouldn't do this right now.

1298
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,540
I shouldn't be on social media,

1299
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,320
all those kinds of shoulds and shouldn'ts

1300
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,690
that are circulating your head.

1301
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:21,523
That's one box.

1302
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:23,170
Then there's what you actually do.

1303
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,580
The behavior, whether or not
you suppress the behavior,

1304
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,100
you turn off your phone and
you go read a book or you go

1305
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,530
to sleep or whether or
not you stay up all night,

1306
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,530
or you stay up for another
hour, even five minutes.

1307
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:37,120
In between those two boxes
are two intervening forces.

1308
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,970
And those intervening forces
are critically important.

1309
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:44,210
Those intervening forces
are homeostatic processes,

1310
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,790
called by some processes, same thing,

1311
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:51,740
homeostatic processes,
that regulate the balance

1312
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,230
of different systems in
your body, hot and cold,

1313
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,790
awake or asleep, dopamine and
the desire to pursue things,

1314
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,290
serotonin and the desire
to just relax and chill.

1315
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,820
So, homeostatic processes
and reward systems.

1316
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,367
And as we now move into
discussion about anorexia,

1317
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:11,660
and bulimia specifically,

1318
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,348
what you'll see is that
anorexia and bulimia

1319
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:20,220
are not a breaking of the
mindset of what one should do

1320
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,960
or shouldn't do.

1321
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,310
It's a disruption of these
homeostatic and reward processes,

1322
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,867
such that decision-making
is completely disrupted.

1323
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:31,230
And in many cases is not available

1324
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,110
to the anorexic or bulimic.

1325
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,261
Now, I don't want to be abstract here.

1326
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:38,820
What I'm saying is that the
person who starves themselves

1327
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,080
to the point where they
might die and in some cases,

1328
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,283
sadly do die.

1329
00:57:42,283 --> 00:57:47,210
They can know perfectly well
that their behavior is leading

1330
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,023
to bad outcomes and possibly even death.

1331
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:53,990
And yet they are not
able to intervene unless

1332
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,800
they get particular clinical help,

1333
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,960
because the homeostatic processes,
the signals from the body

1334
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,540
and brain that say, you need food.

1335
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,920
Those aren't registering in the same way

1336
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,150
that they are for other individuals.

1337
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,440
and for the bulimic or
the person that suffers

1338
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,528
from binge eating disorder.

1339
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:14,930
They don't necessarily
want to eat that food.

1340
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,380
They simply cannot help it.

1341
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,910
It's like a reflex for them,

1342
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:22,090
because the homeostatic processes

1343
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,740
and the reward processes
associated with food,

1344
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,890
are such that they can't intervene

1345
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:30,050
between the should do X, Y, or Z,

1346
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,340
or shouldn't do X, Y, or Z.

1347
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,100
And what their actual behavior is.

1348
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,190
Now, this isn't just a biological
mechanistic explanation

1349
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,660
for what could have been
summarized in two sentences.

1350
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,820
What this is,

1351
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,750
is a roadmap of where interventions

1352
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,420
can really make a difference.

1353
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,390
So, as we talk about different
drug based interventions

1354
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:51,793
or behavioral interventions
or social interventions,

1355
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,870
I'd like you to think

1356
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:58,360
about whether or not those
interventions are breaking into,

1357
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,219
or tapping into this box of the thinking,

1358
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:03,660
the sort of pattern of
thinking around food,

1359
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,690
whether or not it's the behavior,

1360
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,330
the actual ingestion or
the restriction of food,

1361
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,980
or whether or not it's tapping
into the homeostatic process,

1362
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,780
the balance of energy systems
and kind of getting enough,

1363
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:16,960
but not too much, or it's
tapping into the reward system.

1364
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,090
And just as a little teaser
of where we're headed,

1365
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:24,010
what you'll find based on the
data clinical data experiments

1366
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:27,060
done very carefully and very
well by excellent groups.

1367
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,240
What you'll find is the
anorexics have a sort

1368
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,780
of switch that's been flipped,

1369
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,440
such that their decision-making

1370
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,160
is actually pretty darn good.

1371
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,150
It might even be better
than yours in terms

1372
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,010
of evaluating food, nutritional content,

1373
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,240
but their habits are disrupted.

1374
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,690
So, they're not even
consciously aware of the fact

1375
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,010
that they're making terrible.

1376
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:49,430
And in some cases, very
dangerous food choices,

1377
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,830
and turns out that habits.

1378
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:56,800
And the way that we build and
break and rebuild new habits

1379
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,560
is one of the most effective
treatments for anorexia.

1380
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,110
So, now let's talk about anorexia,

1381
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,315
this failure to consume enough energy,

1382
01:00:02,315 --> 01:00:06,250
such that the individuals
at risk of death,

1383
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,113
and if not death, then
severe metabolic disorders,

1384
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,743
lack of bone density, et cetera.

1385
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,640
As I mentioned earlier,

1386
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,830
anorexia and things that
almost certainly were,

1387
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,710
and are anorexia have
been described as early

1388
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:20,880
as the 1600s.

1389
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,270
And maybe even earlier,

1390
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:24,320
there are some records from the saints,

1391
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,213
from the 1400s of people
that refuse to ingest food.

1392
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:34,250
Another common myth is that
anorexia is only the sort

1393
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,430
of thing that you see in rich societies.

1394
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:40,020
These are spoiled
children with so much food

1395
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,650
that they decide they're
only going to focus

1396
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,740
on how slim they are,

1397
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,682
how they look in bathing
suits, et cetera, not true.

1398
01:00:46,682 --> 01:00:51,080
A careful analysis through
medical epidemiology has shown

1399
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,620
that you find anorexia even in cultures

1400
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,300
and societies where food is scarce.

1401
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,750
So, that really speaks
to biological mechanism.

1402
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:02,230
Now it's hard to unveil in
societies where food is scarce,

1403
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,843
because a lot of people
are starving and hungry,

1404
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:09,843
but there are individuals that
choose still to avoid food

1405
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,290
and seem to have some sort of
reward mechanism that rewards

1406
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,750
them, where makes them feel
better if they don't eat,

1407
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,790
despite the fact that their body

1408
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,040
is severely depleted of nutrients.

1409
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,840
So, that's very interesting
and points again

1410
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,590
to some disruption in
some biological mechanism.

1411
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:29,650
Now, I want to make sure
that I'm emphasizing

1412
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,550
that I'm not in favor of people,

1413
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,010
in particular young children, adolescents,

1414
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,370
and teenagers being bombarded

1415
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:39,070
with unrealistic imagery about bodies.

1416
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,760
But the idea that that's the cause of,

1417
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,210
or is amplifying anorexia,
the data just don't seem

1418
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,780
to support that, anorexia
in its classic sense,

1419
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,650
requires that there be an endocrine,

1420
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,930
meaning a hormonal disruption,

1421
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,530
menstrual abnormalities,
lack of sperm production,

1422
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:00,760
or low testosterone in
males, in order to meet

1423
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,550
the classification for anorexia.

1424
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,600
But as I mentioned earlier,

1425
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,320
there are now nuanced and new
classifications of anorexia

1426
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,780
that even for individuals
that still menstruate

1427
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,340
or that maintain a sperm
production anorexia,

1428
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,710
can still be considered

1429
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:19,270
a clinically diagnosable disorder.

1430
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:22,630
Now, typically anorexia
starts in adolescence,

1431
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:23,640
right around puberty.

1432
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,440
Let's take a look at what puberty is.

1433
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,180
Puberty at a very broad
level is the most significant

1434
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,980
and dramatic developmental step.

1435
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,880
Anyone goes through in their lifespan.

1436
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,080
The body changes, the
brain changes, perceptions,

1437
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,400
change, one's own self
perception, changes.

1438
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,630
And most of those changes are
driven by changes in circuitry

1439
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,120
within the hypothalamus.

1440
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,010
So, neurons that are
controlling the production

1441
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,570
of the so-called sex steroid hormones,

1442
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:50,540
things like testosterone,

1443
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,430
estrogen, and related
hormones, prolactin, et cetera.

1444
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:56,403
Those are all changing
at very rapid rates.

1445
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,700
Anorexia tends to show up
around this time in a subset

1446
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:05,040
of individuals who on the
face of it seem to find food,

1447
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,820
aversive, now the purely
psychological theory

1448
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,550
of this is that they are
fighting for autonomy.

1449
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,850
They want control.

1450
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,570
Puberty is also a time in
which children and parents

1451
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,240
are in a tug of war over control.

1452
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,490
You were once a small child
being told when to go to bed

1453
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,430
sent to your room.

1454
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,860
Now you're a child that
can talk back and say,

1455
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,210
I don't want to, or I refuse to.

1456
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,250
And that happens a lot
in various households,

1457
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,896
as I'm sure you're familiar with.

1458
01:03:30,896 --> 01:03:33,300
Adolescence and puberty

1459
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,500
is also when girls start
menstruating typically,

1460
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,890
or boys develop deeper voice,

1461
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:44,470
they start producing sperm, et cetera.

1462
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,800
So, there are a lot of bodily changes

1463
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,430
that also drive perceptual
changes and perceptual changes

1464
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,970
that drive bodily changes.

1465
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:53,710
And it is a dramatic
shift for a young girl

1466
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:56,760
or boy that doesn't nourish
themselves sufficiently.

1467
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,593
During that period,

1468
01:03:57,593 --> 01:04:00,410
there are a number of
downstream negative effects.

1469
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,610
I'll list out some of them,

1470
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:05,330
these are just a subset of
the effects, hypogonadism.

1471
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,870
That's the lack of sperm production

1472
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:10,100
or healthy egg production.

1473
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,390
There is amenorrhea,

1474
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,160
which is the lack of
menstrual cycling, okay?

1475
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,710
So, a failure to have a menstrual cycle.

1476
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:20,130
Reduced insulin secretion,
insulin is this hormone

1477
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,360
that's released in order
to help shuttle glucose

1478
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,660
into various tissues
for energy utilization.

1479
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,330
That's down because energy
levels are down so much.

1480
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,390
One of the symptoms that's
a little more cryptic,

1481
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,490
and that has actually
interesting implications

1482
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:36,593
for sake of the cholesterol
hypothesis is that anorexics

1483
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,450
who ingest very little
food often have cosmically

1484
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:44,010
high levels of cholesterol, including LDL,

1485
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,000
low density, lipoprotein cholesterol.

1486
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,480
You say, well, how could that possibly be?

1487
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,940
We were all told and continue to be told

1488
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,480
from many sources that
ingestion of dietary cholesterol

1489
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,940
is what drives high levels
of bodily cholesterol.

1490
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,030
Cholesterol is manufactured
by the liver and in anorexics

1491
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,058
who consume very little food.

1492
01:05:02,058 --> 01:05:06,140
They often have cosmically
high levels of cholesterol,

1493
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,570
which is one of the kind of wrinkles

1494
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,580
in the so-called dietary
cholesterol hypothesis

1495
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,610
that all of our cholesterol
that we see on a blood panel

1496
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:15,979
is due to what we eat.

1497
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:19,620
But the explanation for it
is that under conditions

1498
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,260
where there's not sufficient cholesterol

1499
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,400
to synthesize the sex steroid hormones,

1500
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,010
things like testosterone and estrogen,

1501
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,130
which are required in
both males and females,

1502
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:31,360
those are made from
cholesterol that the body,

1503
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,840
the liver will start
generating its own cholesterol

1504
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,233
will often overshoot the
mark to a dramatic degree.

1505
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,870
So, the blood lipid profiles and anorexics

1506
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,210
are often very unhealthy despite the fact

1507
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,860
that they're eating very little food.

1508
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,040
In addition, they tend
to have elevated levels

1509
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,600
of things like vasopressin,

1510
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,920
which are hormones that
regulate body temperature

1511
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,160
and salt and blood volume.

1512
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,420
They tend to have low blood pressure.

1513
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,400
They can pass out.

1514
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,750
I mentioned some of the
other symptoms earlier.

1515
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,760
In other words, there are a huge number

1516
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,130
of terrible things happening.

1517
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,520
Thyroid levels are down.

1518
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,500
Heart rates are down, if
I'm painting a very bleak

1519
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,250
picture here is indeed a bleak picture.

1520
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,300
So, we have to ask
ourselves what can be done

1521
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,592
for the anorexic, right?

1522
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:19,310
Let's say it's a failure
of the AgRP neurons

1523
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:22,000
to stimulate appetite and feeding.

1524
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,230
Let's say it's too much
anxiety around food.

1525
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,210
Let's say it's because of
the way that food restriction

1526
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,370
was used for reward in
the household, right?

1527
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:30,203
I'm making this up,

1528
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,840
but you can imagine a
hypothetical scenario

1529
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,840
where let's just say the mother
of a particular individual

1530
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:39,110
is very vocal about her avoidance of food.

1531
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,300
We've seen this before, right?

1532
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,330
You've probably seen
somebody who loves to cook

1533
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,730
and prepare food, but then sits down

1534
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:45,352
and doesn't seem to eat.

1535
01:06:45,352 --> 01:06:48,013
And they always seem to in
air quotes have eaten earlier.

1536
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:49,930
I ate while I cooked, I
ate while I cooked, right?

1537
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:52,850
These people that you
never actually see eating,

1538
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:54,700
we all know people like
this, are they anorexic?

1539
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,050
Possibly, we don't know.

1540
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:58,960
A child observes that kind of behavior.

1541
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,400
Maybe that individual is
being always being told how

1542
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,190
beautiful they look or how
wonderful or fit they look,

1543
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,600
what incredible meals they produce.

1544
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,593
And you could imagine a purely
psychosocial set of events

1545
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,960
that could lead a child to be anorexic.

1546
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,920
That doesn't seem to be the case,

1547
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,620
at least not in terms of driving classic,

1548
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:24,620
anorexia, a really extreme
deprivation of oneself from food.

1549
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:28,810
However, there is a strong
genetic component for anorexia.

1550
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,800
So, you could imagine a mild
form of anorexia in a parent

1551
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,730
that is supported or
exacerbated by praise,

1552
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,830
so that the person feels
good from the praise

1553
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:43,580
they're getting, that they
want to be a low body weight

1554
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,480
for whatever reason,

1555
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,350
for aesthetic reasons or for
whatever reasons that happened

1556
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:48,470
to appeal to them.

1557
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:52,440
And the child has a genetic
predisposition, right?

1558
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,330
We never think about genes in
terms of controlling behavior,

1559
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:59,650
genes, bias, probabilities
for behavior, okay?

1560
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,780
So, you can have a gene for
depression of schizophrenia,

1561
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,290
but it's not deterministic,
in the same way

1562
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,830
that there are genes that
determine your eye color,

1563
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:10,320
or your skin color or
your hair color, okay?

1564
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,060
So, there's a genetic
predisposition there.

1565
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:16,979
And that genetic predisposition
could exist such that if one

1566
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:20,379
is rewarded enough times
for a particular behavior,

1567
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:24,060
that behavior can start to ratchet in

1568
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,260
to our neural circuitry,

1569
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,130
because behavior drives neural changes,

1570
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:28,420
so called neuroplasticity.

1571
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,340
And you could imagine that
that child could develop

1572
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,229
a full-blown case of anorexia.

1573
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:36,249
And this is why I raised at the
beginning that no one really

1574
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,310
knows how to define healthy eating.

1575
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:42,550
And so therefore we have to
rely on just identification

1576
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,920
of unhealthy behaviors,

1577
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,500
but what do we point people to in terms

1578
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,740
of what healthy replacement
behaviors would be.

1579
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,410
So, rather than just look
at anorexics and say,

1580
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:52,460
they're not eating enough.

1581
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,710
And there's this huge
array of terrible things

1582
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,270
that they're doing to their
body, and they need to eat more.

1583
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,720
We need to rescue them from themselves.

1584
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,960
Let's look under the hood.

1585
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,460
Let's look at, what's known
about the neural circuitry

1586
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,790
and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors

1587
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,790
of the neural circuitry is driving,

1588
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:11,790
in order to understand what
they are truly suffering from,

1589
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:14,200
at the level of cause ,not just symptoms,

1590
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,910
it's clear what they're
suffering from at the level

1591
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:18,479
of symptoms, symptoms are how we diagnose.

1592
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:21,760
I listed off a number of those things,

1593
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,649
but let's look under the
hood and try and identify

1594
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:27,522
where one could intervene in theory,

1595
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,300
in order to try and rescue the anorexic

1596
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,450
or help the anorexic rescue themselves.

1597
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:38,180
Because it turns out that
the answer or at least one

1598
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,210
of the answers of how to do
that is not intuitive at all.

1599
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,510
At least to me was very surprising.

1600
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:46,120
I would be remiss if I didn't
start with the obvious,

1601
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,020
which is, is there a chemical defect?

1602
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,540
Meaning is there some
disruption in one of the major

1603
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,280
chemical systems in the brain
that makes anorexics anorexic

1604
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,534
and therefore, can we
replace that chemical?

1605
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:01,350
Or can we reduce some chemical

1606
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,140
and essentially eliminate anorexia?

1607
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,683
And the answer is not
really sort of maybe no,

1608
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:11,210
here's why, there are a
lot of different chemicals

1609
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,310
in the brain and body,

1610
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,830
but there are a category of
chemicals that are particularly

1611
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:19,330
important that if you've
listened to this podcast before,

1612
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,460
even if you haven't are
going to come up again

1613
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,450
and again and again,

1614
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,560
and that is the category
of chemicals in the brain

1615
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,930
and body called the neuromodulators,

1616
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,550
neuromodulators are different
than neuro-transmitters

1617
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,449
in the sense that
neuromodulators modulator

1618
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:35,510
or change the activity of
brain areas in neural circuits,

1619
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,810
you can think of them as
microphones that are held

1620
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:41,290
between particular sets of
connections in the brain

1621
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:43,010
that make those connections in the brain,

1622
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:46,870
more likely to be active
relative to others, okay?

1623
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,923
They make them louder so to speak,

1624
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,210
there are many neuromodulators,

1625
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,650
but the ones that are important for sake

1626
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:55,390
of today's discussion
are the classic ones,

1627
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,690
dopamine, acetylcholine,

1628
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,020
or epinephrin and serotonin.

1629
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,330
Let's focus on serotonin.

1630
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:05,330
Serotonin is a neuromodulator
that tends to increase

1631
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,590
the activity of certain neural circuits,

1632
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,190
including within the hypothalamus,

1633
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:14,420
but also within the body that
trigger a sense of satiety,

1634
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:19,010
of having enough, enough
food, enough warmth,

1635
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:21,090
enough social connection,

1636
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:26,090
enough of any motivated goal
or drive or any type of thing

1637
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,500
or behavior that one would want more of,

1638
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,693
serotonin tends to make
those circuits quiet down.

1639
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:39,180
Now, there are many categories
of drugs that emphasize

1640
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,050
the serotonergic circuitry,
meaning they cause the release

1641
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,350
of, or the efficiency of
serotonin in the brain and body.

1642
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:48,933
Things like Prozac, Zoloft,
Paxil, things of that variety.

1643
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:54,260
Those drugs have been used
to some degree of success.

1644
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:58,480
Although not much to treat
things like anorexia nervosa.

1645
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,820
That should make sense,
because if these drugs increase

1646
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:05,093
serotonin, if their general
effect is to increase serotonin,

1647
01:12:06,249 --> 01:12:08,760
it will be to lower anxiety.

1648
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,260
That sounds like a great thing.

1649
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,320
A lot of anorexics are
really anxious around food.

1650
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,610
We'll talk about why, lowering
anxiety you might think

1651
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,670
would lead to ingestion of more food,

1652
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:23,040
but that's not often what
happens, increasing serotonin,

1653
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,930
by way of some drug regimen will tend

1654
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:30,660
to make one less hungry,
because with heightened levels

1655
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,400
of serotonin in the blood and brain,

1656
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,830
there isn't the desire
to go seek out the things

1657
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:37,800
that will raise serotonin on their own.

1658
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,710
Now, some anorexics do well or benefit

1659
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:43,480
from these serotonergic drugs,

1660
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,820
these drugs that increase the
activity of these circuits

1661
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,847
that leads to satiety.

1662
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:51,090
But if you think about
the major goal of treating

1663
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,690
an anorexic it's to get them

1664
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:55,630
to have more hunger, more appetite.

1665
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:58,530
So, now I want to focus on some
of the work that's been done

1666
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:01,300
around the habits and
behaviors of anorexics,

1667
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,133
because those turned

1668
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:05,363
out to be ideal places for intervention.

1669
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:09,540
The work I'm about to describe was done

1670
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,890
by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues

1671
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,810
at Columbia University in New York.

1672
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,240
And there are other groups as well.

1673
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,910
Of course, they're
doing this type of work,

1674
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:20,180
but they did what I think
are really some beautiful

1675
01:13:21,379 --> 01:13:23,210
experiments and some
beautiful explorations

1676
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:25,040
of potential treatments for anorexics.

1677
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,469
That seemed to have a quite high degree

1678
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:32,320
of effectiveness when they
are applied correctly.

1679
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,260
First of all, there's a
challenge in studying anorexia

1680
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,330
because in anorexia,

1681
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:39,420
what you're essentially
studying is the absence

1682
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,410
of a behavior.

1683
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,320
It's very hard to study
the absence of a behavior,

1684
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,510
as opposed to a behavior.

1685
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,610
So, they did some
experiments with anorexics,

1686
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:51,670
giving them a gallery of
pictures of different foods,

1687
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:54,120
and allowing those anorexia patients

1688
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,400
to arrange those foods,

1689
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,040
according to preference
about what they would select,

1690
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,130
about food, nutrient content
about caloric content.

1691
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:07,140
They essentially asked these
anorexics to evaluate food,

1692
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:07,973
and in doing so,

1693
01:14:07,973 --> 01:14:10,870
they were able to identify
something that's very unique

1694
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:15,290
to anorexics at the level
of their perception of food.

1695
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,830
What they found is the anorexics,

1696
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,400
rather than being anxious
in the presence of food,

1697
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,253
and that anxiety driving
and avoidance of food.

1698
01:14:23,253 --> 01:14:27,050
What they found is that
anorexics have a hyper acuity,

1699
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,340
a hyper awareness of the
fat content of foods,

1700
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:33,890
almost to the point of being
sort of fat content savant.

1701
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,840
Now they don't necessarily
know that they're doing this.

1702
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,910
They're not looking at an
avocado and thinking, okay,

1703
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,702
that's X number of grams of fat rather,

1704
01:14:40,702 --> 01:14:43,933
or looking at an apple and
saying, okay, that has no fat.

1705
01:14:43,933 --> 01:14:47,120
They start to do this
more or less reflexively.

1706
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,900
Now it's a well-known symptom of anorexia,

1707
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,350
especially young anorexics
that they have kind

1708
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:56,140
of an obsession with
food, caloric contents,

1709
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,040
macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein

1710
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,940
and carbohydrate ratios.

1711
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,269
They know caloric numbers,

1712
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:04,810
but then they sort of
pass that information

1713
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,970
into a memory system in
their brain that allows

1714
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,380
their interactions with
food, to be very reflexive

1715
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:16,030
in a way that they are actively
avoiding high-fat content,

1716
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,820
foods, calorie rich foods,

1717
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,860
and defaulting towards
very low calorie foods.

1718
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,030
If they have to eat.

1719
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:26,467
Now, this might seem like
an almost trivial result

1720
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:27,828
on the face of it, you think, okay,

1721
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:29,671
they don't like to eat when they do eat.

1722
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:30,840
They eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh,

1723
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,010
but it's the way in which they
are doing this subconsciously

1724
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,070
that they learn this
information and then they pass

1725
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,200
it off to a reflexive habit.

1726
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,960
And that's very important
because what that means

1727
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,930
is that we need to look at
what processes in the brain,

1728
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:45,770
what brain areas,

1729
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:49,960
what chemicals drive
decision-making and knowledge.

1730
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,340
And we also need to look
at the areas of the brain

1731
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:57,340
that drive habit formation
and habit execution,

1732
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,447
because for any of you that have habits.

1733
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,440
And that means all of you,

1734
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,130
the hallmark feature of a
habit is that it's reflexive.

1735
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:06,470
You have a mosquito bite on
your leg, you scratch it.

1736
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,990
You didn't necessarily even think, oh,

1737
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,274
I'm going to scratch that.

1738
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:13,120
In fact, just to take a little
bit of a moment of respites

1739
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,800
and talk about habits in general,

1740
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,620
there's a beautiful
study that was done out

1741
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,000
of Caltech University,

1742
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,170
looking at the parking
lot of where people park

1743
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:25,810
in the morning, without
designated parking spots,

1744
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,770
and the trajectories that they
use to walk to their offices

1745
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:29,603
in the morning.

1746
01:16:29,603 --> 01:16:30,487
So, they put cameras up
on the roof of Caltech,

1747
01:16:30,487 --> 01:16:33,310
is the kind of thing that
the nerdy kids at Caltech do.

1748
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:34,390
I think at Caltech,

1749
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,170
if you call someone a nerdy
is I think it's a compliment.

1750
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,420
So, my apologies to the
non nerds at Caltech,

1751
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:41,220
I think there's one or two
of you and for the nerdy ones

1752
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,770
of you at Caltech, you're welcome.

1753
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,100
They videotaped the
behaviors of these faculty

1754
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,463
and students and staff.

1755
01:16:48,839 --> 01:16:51,040
And what they found, is that
people follow trajectories

1756
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,730
from their car that are
remarkably stereotype.

1757
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:56,770
First of all, they tend to
park always in the same spot.

1758
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:59,010
If they can, they tend
to get out of their car.

1759
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,240
Of course, 'cause they're
on the driver's side

1760
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,070
or passenger side in the same place.

1761
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,850
They turn and pivot their
body at approximately

1762
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:05,683
the same rate every day.

1763
01:17:05,683 --> 01:17:06,970
They close the door,

1764
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,530
they've put their bag on their shoulder

1765
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:09,570
or across their chest,

1766
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:12,118
or however it is that
they carry their briefcase

1767
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:12,973
or whatever it is.

1768
01:17:12,973 --> 01:17:15,140
And they follow trajectories onto campus

1769
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,770
that are so stereotyped.

1770
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,610
That you'd wonder if you just trace line,

1771
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,530
after line after line.

1772
01:17:19,530 --> 01:17:23,730
What you'd find is that every
day is almost exactly the same

1773
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:24,950
and you do this too.

1774
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,990
You don't realize it because
if you're being videotaped

1775
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,130
in this kind of behavior, it's
not being released to you,

1776
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:33,200
but your behaviors are so
stereotyped to the point

1777
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,440
where if you were to see them
laid out in front of you,

1778
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,100
in kind of diagrammatic
format of the lines

1779
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,410
and the trajectories that you
follow throughout the day,

1780
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,550
the lifting of your mug and how frequently

1781
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:43,630
you drink each hour,

1782
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:47,810
you would be amazed and
probably a little bit scared

1783
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,553
by how much of a robot we all are.

1784
01:17:50,553 --> 01:17:54,720
Now that robotic aspect of
our neurocircuitry is vital,

1785
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,000
because it's what allows us
to think about other things

1786
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,830
and do other things, and
drive other behaviors.

1787
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:03,080
But the work of Dr. Steinglass
and colleagues showed

1788
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,300
that in the case of the anorexic,

1789
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,710
those habits are exactly
the place where things start

1790
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:10,000
to go awry.

1791
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,740
And that drive this very
dysfunctional under-eating behavior

1792
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,150
that sadly often leads to death

1793
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,600
or certainly bad medical outcomes.

1794
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,660
And it turns out that the
brain areas associated

1795
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,280
with habit formation and execution

1796
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,650
are the best point of intervention.

1797
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:28,920
So, what Dr. Steinglass
and colleagues did,

1798
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,020
is they took anorexics and they
of course had control groups

1799
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,210
and they put them in an FMRI scanner,

1800
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,070
which are these brain scanners
that allow you to evaluate

1801
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:42,430
which brain areas are active,
during particular tasks.

1802
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,280
And because when you're
in one of those scanners,

1803
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,990
you actually, you know,

1804
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,220
I've actually been in one of these things.

1805
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:50,030
You're biting down on a
bite bar and you're most

1806
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,560
of the time and most all of
these scanners you're immobile.

1807
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,150
So, you're looking at
things on a TV screen.

1808
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,000
Sometimes you can press
buttons to select choices

1809
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,929
and so forth, but you can't
really eat within those things.

1810
01:18:59,929 --> 01:19:04,929
What they found was that
reward based decision-making,

1811
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:10,040
the drive to pursue a
particular food or the drive

1812
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,480
to perform a particular task,

1813
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,250
which is a lot of what
we do throughout our day,

1814
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,790
that was controlled by a brain area called

1815
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:19,210
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

1816
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:20,830
Let me simplify a little bit of this,

1817
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:23,530
but I'm going to simplify it
by giving you a little detail,

1818
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:25,030
because it's the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1819
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:27,290
And I believe in mechanism,

1820
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,710
mechanism is the way that
you get true understanding

1821
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:34,100
and that you can then be
very quick and give overviews

1822
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,250
of things, but you need the mechanism.

1823
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:41,250
So, you have reflexes and
you have neural processes

1824
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,940
that include what are called duration path

1825
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,770
and outcome type processes,

1826
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:49,910
a duration path, outcome type process,

1827
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,130
we can shorten with DPO.

1828
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:57,130
DPO is for all types of
goal related behaviors.

1829
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,170
So, for instance,

1830
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,750
if you want to get a
particular grade on an exam,

1831
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,590
you want to learn something,
you want to complete a workout.

1832
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,280
You want to go to the grocery
store and pick some stuff up

1833
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,490
and then head home.

1834
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:08,290
You're going to think duration.

1835
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:09,430
How long do I have, okay,

1836
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,180
do I have 45 minutes to get to the store?

1837
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,841
How long does it take to
get to the store path?

1838
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,500
Which way am I going to drive there?

1839
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,050
Which way am I going to navigate
through the grocery store,

1840
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:19,470
outcome, was able to get
in and get the items I need

1841
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:21,010
and get home in time, okay?

1842
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:22,650
DPO, duration path outcome.

1843
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,167
It's a very conscious process.

1844
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:27,470
You tend to take into account
different criteria related

1845
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:30,560
to what's preventing
you from accomplishing

1846
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,393
what you want to do

1847
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,460
and what's helping you or assisting you.

1848
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,293
So, of course,

1849
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:36,540
as you get to the checkout
line in the grocery store,

1850
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,180
you're going to select the
shortest line for instance.

1851
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,410
So, that's all DPO stuff.

1852
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:42,800
It requires decision-making
and it's reward-based,

1853
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,570
you use these DPO type
processes in the short term

1854
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:50,250
to pick up groceries and pick
a line at the grocery store

1855
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,867
and decide which trajectory to take home.

1856
01:20:52,867 --> 01:20:56,920
And you use them for navigating
long extended processes

1857
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,110
in life, trying to get a
degree or raise children

1858
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:03,700
or get through a particularly
challenging year, et cetera.

1859
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,270
So, duration path outcome,

1860
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:09,431
and that entire process
relies on your fore brain.

1861
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:10,581
This prefrontal cortex,

1862
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,870
the prefrontal cortex is what allows you

1863
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:15,530
to take information from memory,

1864
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:18,270
combine it with information
about what's happening

1865
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:21,990
in the present context, and
then to direct your behavior,

1866
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:25,680
your speech, et cetera,
toward particular outcomes.

1867
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,280
And if all that sounds
like a mouthful, it is,

1868
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,010
and it's very metabolically demanding,

1869
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:33,220
decision-making is
metabolically demanding.

1870
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:35,123
It takes effort, okay?

1871
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,100
Reflexes on the other hand,

1872
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,560
don't involve the prefrontal
cortex in the same way,

1873
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,629
habits and reflexes.

1874
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:45,850
Like once you know how to
walk, you get up and you walk,

1875
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:48,392
you don't have to think
about right foot, left foot,

1876
01:21:48,392 --> 01:21:49,225
right foot, left foot.

1877
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:50,058
You just do it.

1878
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:51,850
That doesn't rely on prefrontal cortex.

1879
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,880
It's subconscious as
it's sometimes called,

1880
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,890
but basically you don't have
to use the parts of the brain

1881
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:58,440
that are involved in duration path

1882
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,410
and outcome type analysis.

1883
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:03,360
Okay, so, in this particular study,

1884
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,940
they examined brain activity in anorexics

1885
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:09,940
who are selecting different foods.

1886
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:10,940
And as I mentioned earlier,

1887
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:15,510
they have a hyper acuity or
awareness of which foods contain

1888
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,460
more or less calories than other foods

1889
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,100
and what the fat content
of particular foods is,

1890
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,363
in particular, et cetera,

1891
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,310
they're doing all this while in a scanner.

1892
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:28,340
And then they look at
what sorts of brain areas

1893
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:31,720
are active after that task is done.

1894
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,670
And what they found
was really interesting,

1895
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:36,360
what they found was that the
dorsal lateral prefrontal

1896
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,360
cortex not surprisingly is
involved in the decision-making

1897
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:44,140
and the evaluation of this food,

1898
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,850
which foods are going to be
best to eat in this context,

1899
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:51,290
which foods are going to
be appropriate for at least

1900
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:54,420
that anorexics framework
about what's okay to eat

1901
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,349
and what's not okay to eat and how much.

1902
01:22:56,349 --> 01:23:01,349
However, there are areas of the
brain that were active after

1903
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:03,690
that decision-making process.

1904
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,730
And those are the brain
areas that turn out to drive

1905
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,410
the habit of avoiding particular foods

1906
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:11,480
and approaching other foods.

1907
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,313
And in that case,

1908
01:23:12,313 --> 01:23:14,284
it wasn't the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.

1909
01:23:14,284 --> 01:23:15,930
It was an area of the brain called

1910
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,676
the dorsal lateral striatum.

1911
01:23:17,676 --> 01:23:20,970
Now the striatum is a
big area in the brain.

1912
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,090
It's involved in a lot
of different things.

1913
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:25,113
It includes areas like
the caudate and putamen.

1914
01:23:25,113 --> 01:23:27,810
And I just want to mention, as
I throw out all these names,

1915
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:29,840
you do not need to remember the names

1916
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,850
of these different structures.

1917
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:31,683
They're just there,

1918
01:23:31,683 --> 01:23:33,960
if you are interested
in that level of detail,

1919
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,170
but basically you have a
brain area and anorexics

1920
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,230
have a brain area that's
involved in evaluating

1921
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,770
and decision-making around food.

1922
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:42,170
And then another brain
area that's involved

1923
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:45,950
in the reflexive consumption
of particular foods

1924
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:49,013
and the reflexive
avoidance of other foods.

1925
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,370
If you remember way back at
the beginning of the episode,

1926
01:23:54,346 --> 01:23:55,310
I feel like that was a long time ago now.

1927
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:58,580
When we talked about how you
have these sorts of processes

1928
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,413
in the brain,

1929
01:23:59,413 --> 01:24:01,610
but there are always homeostatic

1930
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:05,380
and reward systems influencing
this kind of thing.

1931
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:08,910
Well, in the brain of the anorexic,

1932
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:12,760
it turns out that the reward
systems have been attached

1933
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,040
to the execution of habits
in a way that is unhealthy

1934
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,280
for body weight,

1935
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,650
but at least from a purely
neural circuit perspective,

1936
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:25,580
the reward is now given this
chemical reward in the brain,

1937
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:29,570
is given for avoiding particular
foods and only approaching

1938
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:33,430
these very low calorie, low fat foods.

1939
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:37,320
So, there really does seem
to be a flip in the switch,

1940
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:40,500
in the anorexic brain that
rewards them internally.

1941
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,940
They feel good when
they avoid certain foods

1942
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:45,370
and they approach others.

1943
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:47,840
So, it's not a deprivation based model

1944
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,364
where they are flagellating
themselves or masochistic

1945
01:24:51,364 --> 01:24:55,560
or actively avoiding food in
order to punish themselves,

1946
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,690
which is interesting because a
lot of psychological theories

1947
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,120
support that idea.

1948
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:04,120
Rather, once this transitions
into a set of habits,

1949
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,460
they are actually getting
a sense of reward.

1950
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,540
They feel good, presumably
from the release

1951
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:11,153
of a different neuromodulator
called dopamine,

1952
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:16,400
by approaching foods that are
low fat, low calorie content.

1953
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,070
And so their whole brain circuitry

1954
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:21,070
is skewed toward avoiding
particular things.

1955
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:24,640
And they actually are rewarded
for that, and they feel good.

1956
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,790
They feel better than if they were eating

1957
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,933
in a healthy weight supporting way.

1958
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,440
Now the dorsolateral
striatum is a structure

1959
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,100
that we should think about
in a little bit more depth.

1960
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,810
It's part of a set of
circuits that are involved

1961
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,870
in what are called go no-go tasks.

1962
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,130
And I don't want to go into this in a lot

1963
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,130
of detail right now,

1964
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,290
because it would take us too far down

1965
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,448
the rabbit hole of neurocircuitry.

1966
01:25:47,448 --> 01:25:51,910
But basically in terms of behaviors,

1967
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:55,390
we both have DPO type behaviors.

1968
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,800
So, decision-making,
reward based behaviors.

1969
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:02,250
And we have habits that
we learn and we acquire.

1970
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,480
And then we just start to
reflexively, things like walking,

1971
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,730
things like yawning when we're tired,

1972
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,550
things like taking a particular route

1973
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,160
through the parking lot, right?

1974
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,660
We learned that the first time
we go to a given parking lot

1975
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,493
and walk into a building.

1976
01:26:14,493 --> 01:26:15,630
But after that, we tend to follow

1977
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:19,092
the exact same trajectory
becomes very automatized.

1978
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:22,270
It's just like, we just
do it without thinking.

1979
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:27,270
Well, the go no-go
circuitry is another aspect

1980
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:28,813
of our behavior,

1981
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:31,315
where we both have to
select behaviors to perform.

1982
01:26:31,315 --> 01:26:34,830
And we have to select
behaviors to suppress.

1983
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:39,830
And the anorexic brain
seems to reward suppression

1984
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,290
of one set of behaviors,

1985
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:45,073
ingestion of high calorie
foods, and to reward focus,

1986
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:50,440
or even hyper-focus and
consumption of low fat,

1987
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,030
low calorie foods.

1988
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:54,280
So, this homeostatic process that we learn

1989
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,270
about from like high school onward,

1990
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,190
that, oh, everything in
your body is designed

1991
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:59,720
to keep everything in balance.

1992
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,280
You stay awake for a
certain amount of time.

1993
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,190
You want to sleep, you
don't eat for a while.

1994
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:05,060
Then you want to eat to
maintain weight, right?

1995
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:05,893
You eat too much.

1996
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:07,150
Then you want to eat less.

1997
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:09,300
Those systems are disrupted.

1998
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,239
And so what's so beautiful about this work

1999
01:27:13,239 --> 01:27:16,770
from the Columbia group,
is that what it says

2000
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:20,780
is the place to intervene
has to be the habit.

2001
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,300
This stuff has already passed
through all the learning,

2002
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,260
it's passed through
all the reward systems.

2003
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:28,270
It's clearly not being overrun
by the homeostatic processes

2004
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:29,103
of the body.

2005
01:27:29,103 --> 01:27:30,118
There's very little body fat.

2006
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:31,640
There's no leptin,

2007
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,970
whatever neurons in the brain
respond to leptin are starved

2008
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:37,400
for leptin, periods of
shutdown, sperm production,

2009
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,080
and testosterone is lowered.

2010
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,280
Bone density is down.

2011
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:44,380
Clearly, this is overriding all
those homeostatic processes,

2012
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,240
all the signals that
would say eat, eat, eat.

2013
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,650
Those don't matter in the
brain of the anorexic.

2014
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:53,770
In the brain of the anorexic
is just performing habits

2015
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:55,540
and they're being rewarded for it.

2016
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:57,550
So, when you come along and say, look,

2017
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:59,700
you should really eat this
whole pie or this whole pizza

2018
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,730
you'll feel better.

2019
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,188
That's how she aversive to them.

2020
01:28:02,188 --> 01:28:04,570
So, since it appears to be a habit,

2021
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:08,700
a reflex that's perpetuating
the anorexic phenotype.

2022
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,610
As we say, in science,

2023
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:12,510
it's perpetuating anorexia
in this individual

2024
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:15,020
and telling them about
all this terrible stuff

2025
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:17,200
that's happening in their body won't work,

2026
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,070
taking them away from all the images

2027
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:21,060
of thin people online, et cetera.

2028
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,610
That's not going to work.

2029
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:24,040
What's going to work.

2030
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,370
What's going to work is intervening
in the neural circuitry.

2031
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:29,193
That's related to the habit itself.

2032
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,917
And it turns out that
there are ways to do that.

2033
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,840
So, how do you break a habit?

2034
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,630
How do you rewire the brain circuitry

2035
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,600
that's literally causing a reflex?

2036
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,230
And in this case causing a reflex

2037
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,640
that is killing the individual,

2038
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,733
or at least leading to
very bad health outcomes.

2039
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,710
The way that you do that is
through a cognitive mechanism

2040
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:51,540
where you teach the individual,

2041
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,820
what is leading up to the habit?

2042
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,450
This is a little bit similar
to the way that somebody

2043
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:59,080
who suffers from addiction starts to put

2044
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,333
in different constraint type behaviors,

2045
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,340
constraint type behaviors,

2046
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,560
are the sorts of things
like where the alcoholic

2047
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,800
will call a hotel ahead
of time and say, listen,

2048
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,800
I want the mini bar taken out of the room.

2049
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,710
I don't want a television
in the room, et cetera,

2050
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:14,170
constraint type behaviors.

2051
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:17,100
Those are really ways of keeping oneself

2052
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,710
from the temptation.

2053
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,010
But with these habits,

2054
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,330
they work at such a subconscious level.

2055
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:26,277
That what seems to work best
is a combination of teaching

2056
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:29,960
the individual about their internal state

2057
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,770
and how to register their internal state.

2058
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:33,390
What we call interoception this ability

2059
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,490
to perceive your internal state,

2060
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:38,050
so that they can start to learn,

2061
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:41,750
to associate the interactions
with different types of food,

2062
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:44,880
with the sorts of cues that are
occurring within their body,

2063
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,720
quickening of heart rate,

2064
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,850
hyper acuity of focus that
we talked about earlier.

2065
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:52,010
Once they start to be able
to notice that those things

2066
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:55,000
are happening, then they
can start to intervene.

2067
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,940
So, let's talk about what
those things are that lead

2068
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:58,943
into a habit,

2069
01:29:59,929 --> 01:30:02,290
because those turn out to
be the exact points of entry

2070
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:06,000
for changing and eliminating
and rewiring habits,

2071
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,550
to a more healthy behaviors.

2072
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:11,304
And I should highlight that
this isn't just about rewiring

2073
01:30:11,304 --> 01:30:12,340
habits for sake of the anorexic.

2074
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:15,080
These are also the same types
of mechanisms that one would

2075
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,280
want to incorporate in
order to rewire any habit

2076
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,430
of any kind.

2077
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:21,205
There are two main features of thinking

2078
01:30:21,205 --> 01:30:25,363
that go into the sorts of
habits that anorexics execute.

2079
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,490
The first is something called
weak central coherence.

2080
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:32,480
Weak central coherence is
essentially an inability

2081
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,010
to see the forest through the trees.

2082
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:38,010
It's a hyper acuity and focus on details

2083
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,040
within a given environment.

2084
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:42,660
And there's actually an
interesting probe test for anorexia

2085
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:46,470
that involves something akin
to kind of a where's Waldo type

2086
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:50,140
of puzzle, where an image is put up.

2087
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:51,210
The one that I saw was one

2088
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:54,110
in which there is a big
array of coffee beans.

2089
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:55,650
Actually, they're all brown coffee beans.

2090
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:59,690
And your job is to identify
where in that array

2091
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,550
of coffee beans, there's a face.

2092
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:03,710
And indeed there's a
face embedded in there.

2093
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:04,990
It looks a little bit like a coffee bean,

2094
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:06,600
but once you see it,
you realize it's a face,

2095
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,060
not a coffee bean.

2096
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:11,963
And it becomes very hard to
not notice the face after that.

2097
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:17,270
Anorexics, are very good
at identifying the face.

2098
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:21,190
They find it much faster
than do non-anorexics,

2099
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:22,970
which is really interesting, right?

2100
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,280
They somehow are able
to hone in on details

2101
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,000
and find those details and
fixate on those details.

2102
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,050
Now eventually, most, if not
all people find the face,

2103
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:35,840
but once you do what you will
find and what everyone finds

2104
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,550
is that you can't unfine
the face, it just jumps out.

2105
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,570
So, what essentially
you've lost is the ability

2106
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,360
to see the whole picture,

2107
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,540
because there's some
detail within that picture

2108
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:46,230
that you're obsessed by.

2109
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:47,480
So, this has kind of elements

2110
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,900
of obsessive compulsive disorder,

2111
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,813
but it's not really obsessive
compulsive disorder per se.

2112
01:31:53,278 --> 01:31:55,787
So, we call that weak central coherence.

2113
01:31:55,787 --> 01:31:58,530
It's a hyper acuity on
one particular feature.

2114
01:31:58,530 --> 01:32:00,240
You miss the big picture.

2115
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,240
The other is a challenge in set shifting

2116
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,060
that once you identify something

2117
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,410
that's of particular interest
and that's driving some sort

2118
01:32:08,573 --> 01:32:09,870
of reward, for the anorexic

2119
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:12,950
that would be identifying the
high-fat foods or identifying

2120
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:16,220
the one food on the table that
one could eat without anyone,

2121
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:19,670
hopefully noticing that they're
eating just the green beans

2122
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:21,440
and not touching any of the other food.

2123
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,680
If you ever had a meal with an anorexic.

2124
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,450
You might be familiar with this.

2125
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,120
It's kind of uncomfortable to be around.

2126
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,740
Actually they go through a
lot of elaborate procedures

2127
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,530
to kind of hide food too.

2128
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:32,790
They'll sometimes even chew food,

2129
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:34,640
hold it in their mouth and
then go to the bathroom

2130
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,410
and discard it things, very elaborate,

2131
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:38,147
very troubling types of
things to hear about,

2132
01:32:38,147 --> 01:32:38,990
and to be around.

2133
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,360
But you'll notice that they push food

2134
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:41,440
around their plate a lot.

2135
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,830
They become masterful actually at trying

2136
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:46,760
to keep people's awareness
away from what they're doing,

2137
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:50,330
which is to hone in on these
low fat, low calorie foods.

2138
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,830
And they can't seem to set shift.

2139
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:54,850
They can't just relax and enjoy
the meal, because the meal

2140
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:58,220
for them is essentially
like this where's Waldo

2141
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,240
or find the face in the
coffee being tasked.

2142
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,590
They're constantly monitoring
how much people are observing

2143
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:05,730
them and trying to navigate this.

2144
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:08,280
What would otherwise be a
really pleasant circumstance

2145
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,130
for most people they're trying to navigate

2146
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:12,100
through this because remember for them,

2147
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,970
the reward is in the
avoidance of certain things

2148
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:17,410
and the acquiring of only the foods

2149
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:19,160
that their brain rewards them for,

2150
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,260
because those are the foods
that have been preselected

2151
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,299
and are now habit.

2152
01:33:22,299 --> 01:33:25,250
What's amazing.

2153
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:28,010
And frankly also important
are these findings

2154
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:31,650
that once you teach anorexics,
what's happening to them,

2155
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:34,702
that they're doing this,
they are able to intervene.

2156
01:33:34,702 --> 01:33:37,240
Now they need support, right?

2157
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,934
And another form of therapy
that seems to work well

2158
01:33:39,934 --> 01:33:43,320
for anorexics that ideally is combined

2159
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,010
with this habit rewiring,
is a family-based model.

2160
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:50,600
Family-based models are
starting to surface a lot now

2161
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,430
in various therapy settings,

2162
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:55,390
therapy based models
in short are basically

2163
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:57,890
where the entire family is made aware

2164
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:59,540
of the individual's challenges

2165
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:02,030
with a particular eating
disorder or other disorder.

2166
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:05,080
And in understanding some of
the biology and psychology

2167
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,430
around it, they stopped
condemning the individual.

2168
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:12,010
They start to support that
individual through queuing them

2169
01:34:12,010 --> 01:34:13,690
towards their own habits
that they observe.

2170
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:14,960
They give them some autonomy.

2171
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,220
They realize that none of
this changes overnight,

2172
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,580
but they're taught about
things like neuroplasticity

2173
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,160
and the ability to change one's brain

2174
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,480
in response to experience.

2175
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,550
And so there's a whole
internal support network.

2176
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:27,400
Now, for people that live alone,

2177
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,670
this isn't available to them.

2178
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:29,790
This isn't the kind of
thing that you share

2179
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,623
with your coworkers.

2180
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:33,520
You might involve a
close friend or a spouse,

2181
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,630
but it's not the sort of thing
that people that don't live

2182
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,913
in a family context can
really benefit from.

2183
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,080
All of these things
fall under the umbrella

2184
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,940
of cognitive behavioral therapy.

2185
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:47,340
And I should mention that
cognitive behavioral therapies

2186
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:51,030
are often done in conjunction
with pharmacologic therapies.

2187
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:54,100
I think that there's this idea
out there that it's either,

2188
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,120
or when often it's both.

2189
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,600
So, cognitive behavioral are
often combined with this habit

2190
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,830
recognition and rewiring approach,

2191
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:04,940
which is starting to become
more and more common.

2192
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,520
And I think the date on
it looked really good

2193
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,830
that especially when it
individuals are taught this early

2194
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:16,242
in adolescence, that there are
positive outcomes over time,

2195
01:35:16,242 --> 01:35:19,020
the relapse rate of
anorexia is quite high.

2196
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,850
It's about 50% of individuals
will relapse at some point

2197
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:24,400
often triggered by a
stressful life circumstance.

2198
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,570
But the combination of
cognitive behavioral therapy

2199
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:28,984
that includes this family model,

2200
01:35:28,984 --> 01:35:31,870
or at least habit reformulation seems

2201
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:33,410
to be fairly effective.

2202
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:36,100
And at present might be the
most effective treatment.

2203
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,620
Now there are additional
treatments starting to surface,

2204
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:40,530
and that takes us into the realm

2205
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:42,790
of chemical treatments for anorexia.

2206
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:46,710
And I just want to mention
that there are clinical trials,

2207
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,790
meaning legal clinical trials being done

2208
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:51,100
at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine by Matthew Johnson

2209
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:55,530
and others, exploring how drugs like MDMA,

2210
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:58,930
which increases dopamine and
serotonin to very high levels

2211
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:02,020
or siliciden so-called magic mushrooms,

2212
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:04,550
which increases serotonin
and other compounds

2213
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:07,350
to very high levels within the confines

2214
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:11,340
of a professionally supported
therapeutic environment

2215
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,430
can help people rewire their brain,

2216
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:16,020
such that they can get
relief from major depression

2217
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,410
and various forms of trauma.

2218
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:20,930
And now eating disorders
are also being explored

2219
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:24,990
in the context of MDMA and
siliciden clinical trials.

2220
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:28,700
I do want to emphasize that
those are clinical trials,

2221
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,750
that those compounds are not yet legal.

2222
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:35,020
And in many cases, most
cases they are still illegal.

2223
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,890
I do not think that
they should be explored

2224
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:42,200
without a properly trained medical doctor,

2225
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,220
that the clinical trials are
essential to complete before

2226
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:48,540
one explores those
compounds in particular,

2227
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,450
because lately I get a lot of
emails about these compounds.

2228
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:53,980
People telling me that they've
had amazing experiences

2229
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:56,580
and relief from various things,
not just eating disorders,

2230
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:58,240
but depression, et cetera.

2231
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:02,590
However, I get an equal number
of emails from people saying

2232
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,129
that they worked with
some self appointed guide.

2233
01:37:05,129 --> 01:37:07,860
This would be outside the
clinical trials I was referring

2234
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:12,180
to, and they are now experiencing
chronic visual, snow.

2235
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,000
They're getting genuine
visual field deficits.

2236
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,060
They are havering ticks that
they have never had before,

2237
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,290
they have chronic insomnia.

2238
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:22,860
So, I'm not passing judgment
on any of these compounds

2239
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,510
or the people that are
doing this sort of thing.

2240
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:26,750
I just want to see the clinical data.

2241
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:29,140
And I do believe that we should
wait until these clinical

2242
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,583
trials are done before people
start approaching the stuff.

2243
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:36,700
And that's because they
are serious compounds.

2244
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:38,285
They can open plasticity,

2245
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:41,599
but whether or not they work quote unquote

2246
01:37:41,599 --> 01:37:43,730
for different types of eating disorders

2247
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:47,840
or depression and trauma, the
data are looking promising,

2248
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,150
but that the clinical
trials are still not done.

2249
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:52,400
And I know a number of people
are going out of the U.S.

2250
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,010
and into other countries
where this stuff is being done

2251
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:56,860
more regularly and there too.

2252
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,830
I've gotten reports back of people doing

2253
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:00,600
so-called ibogaine treatments.

2254
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,930
Some of you who are familiar
with eating disorders

2255
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:05,340
will immediately be asking,
well, what about ibogaine?

2256
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,624
Does it work?

2257
01:38:06,624 --> 01:38:07,457
Does it work?

2258
01:38:07,457 --> 01:38:10,850
Well, the clinical trials in
this country are not complete.

2259
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,600
I've heard evidence direct.

2260
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,950
I've heard directly from
people who have benefited

2261
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:19,480
from the sorts of things, for
treatment of eating disorders.

2262
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,130
But I've also heard of people
that have developed chronic

2263
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:25,650
seizure disorders from
pursuing things like ibogaine

2264
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,480
for the treatment of eating disorders.

2265
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,880
So, again, I'm not passing judgment.

2266
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,740
I would just like to see more data.

2267
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:35,490
And it's very important
that the safety aspects

2268
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,610
of safety be in place.

2269
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:39,328
So, this is definitely not
something to get renegade about.

2270
01:38:39,328 --> 01:38:42,990
So, it appears that once
anorexia has established

2271
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:46,000
that habit breaking through self-awareness

2272
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,340
of what the habits are,

2273
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:50,550
is going to be a primary entry point.

2274
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,023
That might seem kind of trivial.

2275
01:38:52,023 --> 01:38:53,706
You might say, well,

2276
01:38:53,706 --> 01:38:55,100
could you have just told
us that in one sentence,

2277
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,260
but I want to return us to this model

2278
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,863
about homeostatic processes,
reward, processes, et cetera.

2279
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:06,250
That leads us to a place
where the short answer is no,

2280
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:09,160
you can't simply say break the habit.

2281
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,300
An individual needs to be informed

2282
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,877
about where that habit comes from.

2283
01:39:12,877 --> 01:39:15,590
And the fact that what currently seems

2284
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:20,290
like a rewarded habit should
actually be a punished habit.

2285
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:22,550
Now, I don't mean by actual punishment,

2286
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:24,599
but what I mean is within the brain,

2287
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:27,042
there's been a switch
and the anorexic needs

2288
01:39:27,042 --> 01:39:30,870
to learn that there's been a
switch such that what should

2289
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:34,130
be rewarding is now punished
and what should be punished.

2290
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:35,923
Starvation is now rewarded.

2291
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,770
The beauty of being a human
being is that knowledge

2292
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:44,593
of knowledge can allow you
to make better decisions.

2293
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,553
I'll say that again,

2294
01:39:46,553 --> 01:39:48,530
the beauty of being a human
being is that knowledge

2295
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:51,020
of knowledge can allow you
to make better decisions.

2296
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:55,610
Now, of course, when we are
anxious, when we are tired,

2297
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:58,400
when we are intoxicated,

2298
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,790
we have less access to that
ability to use knowledge

2299
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,760
of knowledge, to intervene.

2300
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,990
The anorexic will often do
things that are in keeping

2301
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:09,220
with their habits, such as overexercising.

2302
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,580
This is a area that anyone
who's treated anorexics

2303
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:15,150
or interacted with
anorexics is well aware of,

2304
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:17,260
that they are constantly moving.

2305
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,590
They're constantly on the treadmill.

2306
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:19,680
They're constantly running.

2307
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,220
They always want to be
moving and burning calories,

2308
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:24,340
so that they can feel
okay about interacting

2309
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:27,295
with food or because they
have the distorted body image.

2310
01:40:27,295 --> 01:40:30,980
Well, does breaking a habit mean

2311
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:33,360
that they should stop moving
around and exercising?

2312
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,860
No, not necessarily.

2313
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,830
There's some really
interesting studies that show

2314
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:40,858
that shifting anorexics towards activities

2315
01:40:40,858 --> 01:40:44,960
that for instance, build
muscle resistance training

2316
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,090
and allow them to eat a bit more food

2317
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:51,700
without necessarily losing weight,

2318
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:54,770
but rather to put more
muscle on their body

2319
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:56,722
can actually be beneficial.

2320
01:40:56,722 --> 01:40:58,790
Now I'm not talking about
anorexics becoming bodybuilders,

2321
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:01,670
has all body dysmorphia
associated with bodybuilding,

2322
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:04,870
but certain forms of
exercise are just catabolic.

2323
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:06,540
Meaning they break down
the amount of muscle.

2324
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,890
They reduce body weight, overall,

2325
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:12,030
other types of exercises
like resistance training

2326
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:15,380
or anabolic, they allow
muscle to be put on.

2327
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:18,260
And there are some interesting
studies, not a lot,

2328
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:21,750
but some interesting studies
trying to encourage anorexics,

2329
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,130
not to stop exercising,

2330
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:27,460
but rather to stop exercising
in this neurotic catabolic way

2331
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,930
of breaking oneself down,

2332
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:32,610
but rather getting them
shifted toward breaking habits

2333
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:34,870
of only approaching low
calorie, low fat foods,

2334
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:37,905
while also encouraging them to
embark on resistance training

2335
01:41:37,905 --> 01:41:41,850
and to start to learn and
reward the relationship

2336
01:41:41,850 --> 01:41:45,560
between exercise for sake
of making one's body strong,

2337
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,210
including the bones, not just
the muscles, but the bones,

2338
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:50,640
which is important,
especially in anorexics.

2339
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,840
And then to see food as a
way to nourish that process,

2340
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,980
to building a body that could
be of the stable weight.

2341
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:00,050
Hopefully there, once the
anorexic is of a healthy weight

2342
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:01,730
that they're maintaining that weight,

2343
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:04,350
but that they don't have to
constantly be on this treadmill,

2344
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:08,040
no pun intended of balancing
whatever food intake

2345
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,550
they have with activity.

2346
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:12,104
And along the lines of that.

2347
01:42:12,104 --> 01:42:15,450
During the episode on fat
loss and metabolism as well,

2348
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:19,200
I talked about this neat
and non-exercise induced

2349
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:22,510
thermogenesis where people
who tend to be thin,

2350
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:23,820
tend to bounce around a lot.

2351
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,694
They're kind of fidgety
and that burns 1000

2352
01:42:26,694 --> 01:42:28,877
of calories a day, anywhere
from 800 to 2000 calories a day.

2353
01:42:28,877 --> 01:42:31,882
Now that can be beneficial for
the folks that are overweight

2354
01:42:31,882 --> 01:42:33,960
and have a healthy mindset about food,

2355
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,430
but are trying to lose weight.

2356
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:38,640
And it turns out that by, you

2357
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,270
literally fidgeting and
bouncing around, like,

2358
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:41,877
this is why I'm doing this.

2359
01:42:41,877 --> 01:42:42,710
It looks ridiculous.

2360
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:45,200
You actually burn a lot
of body fat and calories.

2361
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,320
That way provide you're
in a caloric deficit,

2362
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,940
you'll burn body fat
because body fat is not just

2363
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:50,773
a passive tissue.

2364
01:42:50,773 --> 01:42:52,810
It actually receives input from neurons

2365
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:55,040
that release noradrenaline and adrenaline.

2366
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,333
And this neat.

2367
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:59,240
Has been described for
several decades now.

2368
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:00,910
And it actually is a pretty terrific way

2369
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:02,253
to burn off more calories.

2370
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:04,880
So, with the anorexic,

2371
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,620
you actually want to encourage
them to not constantly

2372
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,610
be trying to burn off calories.

2373
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:10,660
That can be very challenging.

2374
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:14,010
So, shifting them toward
activities like weight bearing

2375
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:16,580
activities or resistance
training that promote

2376
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:19,980
this more anabolic type of
relationship to activity,

2377
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:22,140
as opposed to catabolic can be beneficial.

2378
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:24,880
Before we move on to talking
about bulimia and some related

2379
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,500
disorders, I want to talk
about an aspect of anorexia.

2380
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,850
That's very interesting,
quite troubling in fact,

2381
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:33,460
but that has received a lot of attention

2382
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,110
and that's the distorted self image.

2383
01:43:38,110 --> 01:43:40,890
Now, episode and depression,

2384
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:45,720
we talked about a very powerful
aspect of major depression,

2385
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,050
which is this anti-self
confabulation that people

2386
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:51,450
who are depressed seem
to genuinely believe.

2387
01:43:51,450 --> 01:43:53,280
And even confabulate about the fact

2388
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,110
that they are performing poorly in life

2389
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:58,110
and that they are no good or
not, or worthless, et cetera.

2390
01:43:58,110 --> 01:44:02,410
It's literally a lie that they
believe and their statements

2391
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:04,140
and their feelings and
their behaviors start

2392
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:05,590
to reflect that lie.

2393
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:06,510
They're not conscious of it.

2394
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:08,410
That's why we call it a confabulation.

2395
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:14,890
Anorexics often will see
themselves as overweight

2396
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:18,830
or imperfect in ways that
are of an obsession for them,

2397
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:19,663
they'll think, oh, you know,

2398
01:44:19,663 --> 01:44:22,340
their arms are a little bit fat, you know,

2399
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:24,010
or, you know, the contour,

2400
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:26,510
their face makes they
don't like the pictures

2401
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:28,070
of themselves or they.

2402
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:30,690
What I'm describing here is
actually pretty typical behavior

2403
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:31,750
of a lot of people.

2404
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:33,490
I mean, how many people do
you know that after you take

2405
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:35,430
a picture of them, they
say, can I see the picture?

2406
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,610
And then they tell you that
you have to throw it away.

2407
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:39,430
That doesn't necessarily
mean they're anorexic

2408
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:41,400
or they're suffering from
some sort of disorder.

2409
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,510
That just means that they're
a human being that cares

2410
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:45,600
about how they appear in the world.

2411
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,960
We're not here to judge that
in the case of the anorexic.

2412
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:53,110
The problem seems to be that
they have a genuine distortion

2413
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:57,930
of their self image so much so
that they don't actually see

2414
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:01,890
themselves accurately, their
visual perceptions are off.

2415
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:03,003
And the reason we know this,

2416
01:45:03,003 --> 01:45:05,190
it's because of some really important

2417
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:08,908
and beautiful studies that
were done with my colleague,

2418
01:45:08,908 --> 01:45:10,060
Jeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford,

2419
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,720
he's in the department of communications,

2420
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,810
he's actually collaborated

2421
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:15,190
with a Dr. Halpern that
I mentioned earlier.

2422
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:17,240
What's really interesting about
these studies is they give

2423
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:20,876
us a window into the perceptual
defect that anorexics have.

2424
01:45:20,876 --> 01:45:23,500
I've actually done one
of these experiments.

2425
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,060
I'm fortunate to not be anorexic,

2426
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:27,894
but I've done some work
with the VR lab over there.

2427
01:45:27,894 --> 01:45:31,073
And what you get to do is
you get to adjust this avatar

2428
01:45:31,073 --> 01:45:32,460
of yourself to the point
where you think it's,

2429
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:34,660
as accurate as it could possibly be,

2430
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:39,260
and anorexics, really distort this avatar.

2431
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,093
In other words,

2432
01:45:40,093 --> 01:45:43,540
they create this serious
mismatch between their perception

2433
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:44,820
of themselves and the reality.

2434
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:49,030
So, indeed it does seem to be
the case now what's relieving,

2435
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:51,410
or I should say what's encouraging

2436
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:53,280
about some of the therapies that we talked

2437
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,770
about before the family based model,

2438
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:57,296
the Connie behavioral treatments.

2439
01:45:57,296 --> 01:45:59,630
Yes, and the drug treatments as well.

2440
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:03,990
But this habit intervention
model is that as one starts

2441
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:05,720
to shift those things,

2442
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,470
it does appear that the
perception of self seems

2443
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:11,079
to follow that the
perception of self seems

2444
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:14,370
to shift along with the change in habits.

2445
01:46:14,370 --> 01:46:15,595
And that's a relief,

2446
01:46:15,595 --> 01:46:17,360
or at least I find that reassuring

2447
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:21,750
because changing one's
perception is actually very hard,

2448
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:24,030
as somebody who's worked
almost his entire career

2449
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:26,530
on visual perception and related things.

2450
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:31,520
The perceptual apparatus of
the brain are not very amenable

2451
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,570
to neuroplasticity, meaning
they don't change that easily.

2452
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:37,090
Whereas it appears that the circuitry

2453
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,287
that's related to habit
formation, and decision-making

2454
01:46:39,287 --> 01:46:42,950
and the reward, circuitry,
that stuff can be rewired.

2455
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:45,040
And so anorexics as they progress

2456
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,950
out of their anorexic state into one,

2457
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:51,270
which they are intervening
in their reflexes,

2458
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:53,823
gaining better habits
around food, eating more,

2459
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:57,920
more accurately, assessing foods

2460
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,470
and environments that
they're in related to food,

2461
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:01,640
as they change their behavior.

2462
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,140
And they start to put on healthy weight,

2463
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,390
maybe they're also doing the
sorts of exercises that allow

2464
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:07,920
them to put on healthy
weight and avoiding kind

2465
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,200
of extreme exercises of cannibalism

2466
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,600
and breaking themselves down.

2467
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,350
They also managed to somehow
just as a consequence

2468
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:18,460
of all that rewire their
perception of self.

2469
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:20,620
So, it doesn't seem that
trying to tell someone,

2470
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:22,290
oh my gosh, you're so thin.

2471
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:23,400
You really need to eat.

2472
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,920
That doesn't seem to work.

2473
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,700
They just don't see
themselves the same way

2474
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:28,760
that you see them.

2475
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:31,590
And so I offer that as a
point of consideration,

2476
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:32,940
if you know someone that's anorexic,

2477
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,010
or if you look at an
anorexic and you think,

2478
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:38,770
how is it that they are
still critical of the small,

2479
01:47:38,770 --> 01:47:40,620
even nonexistent amount of body fat

2480
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:42,070
on their triceps or something?

2481
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:42,950
How is that?

2482
01:47:42,950 --> 01:47:45,370
Well, it's literally that their brain,

2483
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:46,760
as it relates to perceptions,

2484
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:50,170
visual perceptions in particular,
they're completely off.

2485
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:52,130
And fortunately by changing habits,

2486
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:54,240
you rewire those circuits as well.

2487
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,718
Okay, so let's talk about bulimia,

2488
01:47:55,718 --> 01:48:00,718
which is overeating and
then purging typically

2489
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,970
by self-induced vomiting or by ingestion

2490
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:07,100
of laxatives, sometimes also in concert

2491
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:11,280
with people taking
stimulants and fat burners,

2492
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,821
over ingestion of stimulus to
try and burn off more energy.

2493
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:16,850
And then we'll also talk
about binge eating disorder,

2494
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:20,010
which has a lot of the
same features as bulimia,

2495
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,063
but typically no purging.

2496
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,470
I'm not going to list off
all the clinical criteria

2497
01:48:26,470 --> 01:48:30,450
that would allow someone
to be diagnosed as bulimic

2498
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:32,470
or binge eating disorder.

2499
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:35,520
But the general features are
that they ingest far more

2500
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,520
calories than they need,
anywhere from 10 to 30 times,

2501
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:42,360
their daily caloric intake,

2502
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:45,210
oftentimes within a two hour period,

2503
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:49,090
which is just a staggering
amount of food and nutrients

2504
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:50,850
in a short period of time.

2505
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:53,510
Oftentimes they're overriding
those mechanical signals

2506
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:54,848
from the body that they're full.

2507
01:48:54,848 --> 01:48:58,780
It's a really troubling
thing to think about,

2508
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:01,010
but people are literally
gorging themselves with food.

2509
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:05,130
This looks a lot like a laboratory animal

2510
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:07,292
that has these AgRP neurons stimulated,

2511
01:49:07,292 --> 01:49:08,640
these neurons that will eat

2512
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,430
until they almost burst or burst.

2513
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,880
So, you wonder is that these
AgRP neurons that are active

2514
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,070
almost certainly yes.

2515
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:16,240
That they're involved.

2516
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:17,680
Although I don't think that that's going

2517
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,604
to be the major point of intervention,

2518
01:49:20,604 --> 01:49:23,720
but we're going to talk about
other types of interventions.

2519
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:25,350
There are a number of clinical criteria.

2520
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:28,340
For instance, if somebody
has one of these binges

2521
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:30,860
once a year, does that make them bulimic?

2522
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:34,450
Technically, no, but I certainly

2523
01:49:34,450 --> 01:49:36,252
don't recommend people do this.

2524
01:49:36,252 --> 01:49:38,560
If you are one of these people

2525
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,730
who has so-called cheat days, right?

2526
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,070
Some of you may be
familiar with cheat days.

2527
01:49:43,070 --> 01:49:44,380
I think they're a little less common now,

2528
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:47,650
but the idea is you eat clean for six days

2529
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:49,470
or five days a week or two weeks.

2530
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:51,320
And then you have a so-called
cheat day where you just kind

2531
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,815
of go wild and eat whatever
you want and whatever volumes

2532
01:49:53,815 --> 01:49:55,110
is that bulimia.

2533
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:58,380
And it has some of the contour of bulimia.

2534
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,800
If you're vomiting afterwards
or binge eating disorder,

2535
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:01,880
if you're not,

2536
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:03,760
does it constitute full blown bulimia

2537
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,900
or binge eating disorder?

2538
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,391
And it's pretty hard to say,

2539
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:07,960
the criteria that were described

2540
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,890
to me is that if somebody
is doing this at least once

2541
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:13,870
a month, over a period of
anywhere from two to three months,

2542
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:16,240
then it likely would qualify.

2543
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,050
And I certainly know people
who do these cheat days

2544
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:21,320
and by those criteria,

2545
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,840
they have something like
binge eating disorder.

2546
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:24,784
But in general,

2547
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:28,926
one of the hallmark features
of bulimia binge eating

2548
01:50:28,926 --> 01:50:31,920
disorder is that people are
unable to control their eating.

2549
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,810
They're just simply,

2550
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:35,440
they're not making the
decision to have a cheat day.

2551
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,920
They're not making the
decision to overeat.

2552
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,920
They are simply driven from
the inside without question

2553
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,570
by way of neurocircuitry.

2554
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:50,120
They are driven from the
inside to ingest far more food

2555
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,310
than they need.

2556
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:54,170
And in some cases than
they would want to eat.

2557
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:56,500
So, it's a lot like the habit

2558
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,700
that we described for anorexia,

2559
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,090
it's almost like it's
turned into a reflux once

2560
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:03,890
they get going, all
the homeostatic signals

2561
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:07,130
are being overridden, all
the signals from the body,

2562
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:10,230
the leptin, the insulin, the glucose,

2563
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:12,280
all that stuff has cosmically sky high.

2564
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,221
And yet they're just what we,

2565
01:51:14,221 --> 01:51:18,933
the nerds call hyperphagic,
they're just eating like crazy.

2566
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:21,549
So, what's going on there?

2567
01:51:21,549 --> 01:51:23,303
Well, there've been a lot of ideas,

2568
01:51:23,303 --> 01:51:26,540
about why this arises.

2569
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,530
There's the so-called
thyroid hormone hypothesis.

2570
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:31,810
That one's a tricky one.

2571
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,710
It turns out that cortisol

2572
01:51:33,710 --> 01:51:37,080
and thyroid hormone
concentrations vary according

2573
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:40,350
to when the binge purge happened.

2574
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,920
So, there were some studies that looked

2575
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,189
at thyroid hormone levels

2576
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:47,110
and they found elevated
thyroid hormone levels.

2577
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:49,480
Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism

2578
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:51,940
and not just the burning of energy,

2579
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:55,620
but the use of energy in
converting it to different tissues

2580
01:51:55,620 --> 01:52:00,255
of the body, cartilage bone,
fat, and muscle, et cetera,

2581
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:02,590
did a whole episode on
thyroid and growth hormone.

2582
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:03,709
By the way,

2583
01:52:03,709 --> 01:52:06,013
if you're interested in learning
more about thyroid hormone,

2584
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:11,220
but thyroid hormone can also
be depleted at other phases

2585
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,760
of the binge purge cycle.

2586
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,020
Now, without listing off
all the terrible things

2587
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:18,240
that happen with this binge purge cycle,

2588
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:19,320
there are a number of things

2589
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:21,440
that are really worth pointing out.

2590
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,563
One is that the vomiting itself,

2591
01:52:23,563 --> 01:52:27,220
the use of laxatives that
can cause severe disruption

2592
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:29,910
to the mucosal lining the mucus lining

2593
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,460
of the digestive tract
can severely disrupt

2594
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,130
the gut microbiome.

2595
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:39,130
It can cause all sorts of even
a ulceration of the esophagus

2596
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,163
and just really terrible stuff.

2597
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:45,740
There's a lot of shame
associated with bulimia,

2598
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:50,060
oftentimes because people are
vomiting and it's hard to hide

2599
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:53,100
that vomiting behavior,
people are aware of it.

2600
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,564
There's some social isolation.

2601
01:52:54,564 --> 01:52:55,900
So, you recall from the beginning,

2602
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:58,420
it does not appear that sexual trauma

2603
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:00,590
is a prerequisite for bulimia.

2604
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:03,290
Although sometimes it can
occur the hallmark feature

2605
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:06,830
of bulimia that distinguishes
it from anorexia,

2606
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:08,760
aside from the fact that
it's overeating as opposed

2607
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:10,680
to under-eating is a lack

2608
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:12,820
of what they call inhibitory control.

2609
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,358
And that might come as no surprise.

2610
01:53:14,358 --> 01:53:19,160
But first of all, the bulimic,

2611
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:24,160
unlike the anorexic is hyper
impulsive and oftentimes

2612
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:26,670
has other types of impulse behaviors.

2613
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:28,600
They might have a little bit of alcohol

2614
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,550
and then start to eat like crazy.

2615
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:32,060
Whereas normally they're very restrictive.

2616
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:34,830
That's a common feature of bulimia,

2617
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:38,190
sometimes they over ingest
alcohol during these binges.

2618
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:41,980
Sometimes they are sexually
promiscuous, not always,

2619
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:45,200
but it's a general issue with satiety

2620
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,800
once they start eating and
with impulse control generally.

2621
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,951
And for that reason,

2622
01:53:49,951 --> 01:53:52,410
many of the treatments
that you see for bulimia

2623
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:55,170
and binge eating disorder
are the sorts of treatments

2624
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:57,540
that don't seem to work so well,

2625
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:00,200
or at least most of the time for anorexia.

2626
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:03,150
So, the drugs that increase
the neuromodulator serotonin,

2627
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:06,890
for instance, fluoxetine

2628
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:09,620
also called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera.

2629
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:13,890
Those things oftentimes can
be effective in bulimia.

2630
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:16,330
Some of the drugs that are
used to treat attention deficit

2631
01:54:16,330 --> 01:54:18,870
hyperactivity disorder an
ADD, a topic that we're going

2632
01:54:18,870 --> 01:54:22,330
to talk about in depth
here on the podcast soon,

2633
01:54:22,330 --> 01:54:24,323
some of those same drugs like Adderall,

2634
01:54:25,437 --> 01:54:29,100
Vyvanse and things of
that sort can also be used

2635
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,670
to treat bulimia and
binge eating disorder.

2636
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,630
Why would that work?

2637
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:35,290
Well now you are familiar
with the prefrontal cortex.

2638
01:54:35,290 --> 01:54:36,790
You probably know more
about prefrontal cortex

2639
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:40,164
than you ever wanted to,
just from this episode,

2640
01:54:40,164 --> 01:54:44,450
prefrontal cortex is involved
in this analysis of duration

2641
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:45,436
path and outcome.

2642
01:54:45,436 --> 01:54:49,970
Duration path and outcome
is how we avoid impulsivity.

2643
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:50,803
It's how we think.

2644
01:54:50,803 --> 01:54:52,950
Okay, if this, then
that, if that, then this,

2645
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:54,870
you can imagine how for
the obsessive compulsive

2646
01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:59,420
or for the anorexic, these are
circuits that are overactive.

2647
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:03,080
For the bulimic this is
the circuit that's going

2648
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,420
to essentially be underactive
and is under conditions

2649
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:08,660
where they think, oh, you
know, I shouldn't eat anything.

2650
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:09,493
I shouldn't eat anything.

2651
01:55:09,493 --> 01:55:12,160
And then they just tear
the refrigerator open

2652
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,550
and plow through that.

2653
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:16,230
And then at that point they're
plowing through the cupboards

2654
01:55:16,230 --> 01:55:17,360
and then they're ordering food.

2655
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,410
And then they're feeling
horrible about themselves.

2656
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:23,510
There do tend to be these cycles
of binge and purge followed

2657
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:26,020
by feelings of real shame

2658
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:28,700
because they just can't
control their behavior.

2659
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:32,327
And what is more embarrassing
than not being able to control

2660
01:55:32,327 --> 01:55:34,660
one's behavior as an
adult or as a young adult.

2661
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:38,610
So, really the polar opposite
of what you see in anorexia.

2662
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:41,270
So, this lack of impulsivity implies

2663
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:43,040
a lack of prefrontal control.

2664
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,230
What we call top-down control.

2665
01:55:44,230 --> 01:55:45,090
Why do we call it top-down?

2666
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:47,010
Because the prefrontal
cortex is suppressing

2667
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:51,990
the activity of deeper limbic
and hypothalamic circuitry,

2668
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:53,620
and things of that sort.

2669
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:56,690
Anytime you feel like
you want to say something

2670
01:55:56,690 --> 01:56:01,690
really offensive and you
don't, that's top-down control.

2671
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:03,150
That's your prefrontal cortex.

2672
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,630
Anytime someone says something

2673
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:07,160
and you like grow your teeth.

2674
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,880
'Cause you'd know you
shouldn't say anything,

2675
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,670
gritting your teeth is
top-dow control, okay?

2676
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:15,080
When you explode or burst
or say the wrong thing,

2677
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:18,150
or say the thing that you
shouldn't say or do the thing

2678
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,290
you shouldn't do, that's
lack of prefrontal control.

2679
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:22,690
And indeed people who have
frontotemporal dementia

2680
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:24,282
due to aging or head injuries,

2681
01:56:24,282 --> 01:56:27,300
see this a lot and people play sports get

2682
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,680
a lot frontal damage.

2683
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:31,260
They become more impulsive.

2684
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:35,630
So, bulimics have an
issue with impulsivity,

2685
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:39,580
and therefore drugs that
can increase serotonin.

2686
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:42,450
And sometimes these drugs
that increase dopamine

2687
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:45,170
and adrenaline also called epinephrin,

2688
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:49,320
will increase the tone as we
call it the dopaminergic tone

2689
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:52,250
or the, it's called adrenergic,

2690
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:54,930
but norepinephrine
levels in the brain allow

2691
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:56,330
for more top-down control.

2692
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:58,870
And that's also why
they're used to treat ADHD

2693
01:56:58,870 --> 01:57:00,513
and attention deficit disorder.

2694
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:03,600
They tend to create a hyper-focus.

2695
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,670
They tend to push the brain into,

2696
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:07,230
these drugs tend to create a hyper-focus,

2697
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:10,100
and tend to push the brain
and general motor processing

2698
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:12,950
into one in which you think
if this, then that, if this,

2699
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:15,290
then that, so anticipating outcomes.

2700
01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:20,210
And for that reason, drugs
like Wellbutrin, bupropion,

2701
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:21,310
which is an antidepressant,

2702
01:57:21,310 --> 01:57:23,990
which mainly increases
the amount of dopamine

2703
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:26,780
and norepinephrine and less serotonin,

2704
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:28,720
that can also be effective
for certain types

2705
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,770
of binge-eating disorder is actually used

2706
01:57:31,996 --> 01:57:35,090
to treat smoking, for
promoting smoking cessation

2707
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:39,170
and for depression, but
also for certain forms

2708
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:41,600
of obesity related to
binge eating disorder.

2709
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:42,740
And the data are pretty good.

2710
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,170
And there are timed release forms

2711
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:45,660
of this and non-time release forms.

2712
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:49,490
And I think you have to consult
with a psychiatrist in order

2713
01:57:49,490 --> 01:57:51,930
to get these prescribed because
they are prescription drugs,

2714
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:55,240
but it's a very different
constellation of neurochemicals

2715
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:59,240
and brain areas and
approaches for bulimia.

2716
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:02,580
The treatment of binge eating
disorder has been explored

2717
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:05,300
from a new standpoint recently.

2718
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:07,590
And that's the work of this now,

2719
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:10,380
sadly, former colleague of
mine, Dr. Casey Halpern,

2720
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,570
who's at University of Pennsylvania

2721
01:58:13,763 --> 01:58:14,800
that I mentioned earlier,

2722
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,450
they are using deep brain stimulation

2723
01:58:17,450 --> 01:58:19,800
in order to treat binge-eating disorder.

2724
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,690
Now why deep brain stimulation?

2725
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:25,850
Well work from Dr.
Halpern and others while

2726
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:29,350
at Stanford showed that
there are particular patterns

2727
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:33,320
of brain activity in both
the prefrontal cortex,

2728
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,960
but also in an area of the brain

2729
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,610
called the nucleus accumbens,

2730
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:40,280
very important and very
relevant area of the brain

2731
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:41,160
in this context,

2732
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:45,140
and in any discussion
about motivated behaviors

2733
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:47,613
of any kind, feeding,
sex, drug relay behavior,

2734
01:58:47,613 --> 01:58:50,932
people exercise compulsively,

2735
01:58:50,932 --> 01:58:54,670
the nucleus accumbens
is in a ongoing dialogue

2736
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:56,599
with the prefrontal cortex
and the nucleus accumbens

2737
01:58:56,599 --> 01:58:59,104
has no mind of its own,
but it's associated

2738
01:58:59,104 --> 01:59:00,450
with dopamine release.

2739
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:03,510
It's part of this
so-called reward pathway.

2740
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:06,580
And what Dr. Halpern and
colleagues discovered

2741
01:59:06,580 --> 01:59:09,210
is that there are particular
patterns of activity

2742
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:11,150
that ripple through the brain,

2743
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:13,300
through these prefrontal
networks and through

2744
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:16,233
this nucleus accumbens area,
those areas are connected.

2745
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:19,010
It's called Delta oscillations,

2746
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:21,330
Delta, just being a particular frequency

2747
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:23,720
of electrical activity for your aficionado

2748
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,363
as wonderful heart activity.

2749
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:27,975
But in any case,

2750
01:59:27,975 --> 01:59:30,890
those Delta oscillations
in the nucleus accumbens

2751
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:35,090
are associated with food
reward in both mice and humans.

2752
01:59:35,090 --> 01:59:39,550
Somehow this reverberatory
activity creates a perception

2753
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:42,483
in the individual that
food is hyper rewarding.

2754
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:46,642
And that's interesting,
and has allowed them

2755
01:59:46,642 --> 01:59:48,850
to use a targeted deep
brain stimulation approach

2756
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:50,770
to treat binge-eating disorder.

2757
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:53,850
And this deep brain
stimulation is appearing

2758
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:55,400
to be an effective treatment.

2759
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,910
There's still more studies
that need to be done.

2760
01:59:57,910 --> 02:00:01,670
Actually, if you think you
have binge-eating disorder,

2761
02:00:01,670 --> 02:00:04,000
you can find the criteria for that.

2762
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,620
And you could contact Dr. Halpern he's.

2763
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,670
As I mentioned, he's moving
to University of Pennsylvania.

2764
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11,867
They are recruiting patients
for these studies all the time.

2765
02:00:11,867 --> 02:00:13,640
The studies are fairly invasive.

2766
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:18,400
They involve a FDA approved
approach of literally placing

2767
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:21,733
a wire down into an
area of the brain that,

2768
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:26,520
and allows the individual to
stimulate a particular brain

2769
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:30,100
area to offset some of
these activity patterns

2770
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:34,500
that lead to a elevated
sense of reward from food

2771
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:35,780
and binge eating.

2772
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:37,460
And the data looked really promising.

2773
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:39,720
Now I realize that's a
very invasive approach.

2774
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:42,080
Not everybody is going to be willing

2775
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:44,530
to have this wire inserted into the brain,

2776
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:47,120
but for people that suffer
from binge-eating disorder.

2777
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:52,120
This is a great and very
exciting potential treatment.

2778
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:54,650
Because what I didn't tell
you is that many people

2779
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:57,180
have binge eating disorder are obese

2780
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:59,840
to the point where their
health is greatly risk.

2781
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,700
Now, obesity causes all sorts
of shifts in the dialogue

2782
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:06,490
between the brain and body.

2783
02:01:06,490 --> 02:01:08,960
Some of which you'll
recognize from earlier

2784
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,587
in the discussion, for instance,

2785
02:01:10,587 --> 02:01:13,610
leptin signaling is disrupted.

2786
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:16,210
So, the fat there's lots of body fat,

2787
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:18,570
but even though that
body fat is secreting,

2788
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:21,610
this hormone leptin in that
signal should shut down

2789
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:22,567
the desire to eat.

2790
02:01:22,567 --> 02:01:26,680
The receptors to leptin in the
brain are totally screwed up.

2791
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:29,100
And so the signal to eat is there,

2792
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,400
but the signal to stop
eating is not there.

2793
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,100
So, again, you have an
accelerator and a brake,

2794
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:35,177
and it's like, the accelerator
has always pushed down.

2795
02:01:35,177 --> 02:01:37,590
Some of these brain
stimulation approaches seem

2796
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,720
to be able to bypass some of that,

2797
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:42,070
and of course there all
the metabolic syndromes

2798
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:45,750
and the problems with having
excess levels of body fat,

2799
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:48,660
things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes.

2800
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:51,921
I mean, as disturbing as is to here,

2801
02:01:51,921 --> 02:01:53,820
there are many individuals, actually,

2802
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:57,600
I know some who are so obese

2803
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:59,750
that they start getting bodily sores.

2804
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:00,700
They're not just bedsores,

2805
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:05,060
but they have skin sores that
are very disruptive to them.

2806
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:06,840
They don't like having these sores.

2807
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,303
And in addition to that,

2808
02:02:09,603 --> 02:02:10,575
they can get peripheral neuropathies

2809
02:02:10,575 --> 02:02:12,930
because of some of these metabolic issues.

2810
02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:16,040
They're not getting enough utilization

2811
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,880
of the nutrients in the tissue,

2812
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:21,550
because the way that insulin
has disrupted insulin singling,

2813
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:23,480
and they actually have
to have certain portions

2814
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:26,590
of their limbs amputated, and
yet they continue to overeat.

2815
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:30,850
So, this is not an issue of
self-control that can easily

2816
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:32,900
be dealt with simply by
telling the person, look,

2817
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:34,940
you have to stop eating
or you're going to die,

2818
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:36,950
or you're going to have
your legs amputated.

2819
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:38,640
Like with anorexia,

2820
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:41,850
there's a distortion in
the relationship to food,

2821
02:02:41,850 --> 02:02:45,850
but the homeostatic and the
reward aspects are disrupted.

2822
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:47,110
So, unlike anorexia,

2823
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:50,170
where it seems to be a
habit based mechanism

2824
02:02:50,170 --> 02:02:53,200
with bulimia and binge eating disorder,

2825
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:56,100
something deep within the
neural circuitry is causing food

2826
02:02:57,139 --> 02:03:00,150
to be hyper attractive
and the break is off.

2827
02:03:00,150 --> 02:03:02,170
So, if you want to develop some empathy

2828
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:03,600
for what these people are dealing with,

2829
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:06,480
consider this, it's like driving a car,

2830
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:10,640
you get onto a grade, maybe
a 10 or 15 degree grade,

2831
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:13,670
and you're heading down
and you figure, well,

2832
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:15,300
you'll just pump the brakes a little bit,

2833
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:16,810
but there is no break, right?

2834
02:03:16,810 --> 02:03:18,930
So, you start going faster
and faster and faster.

2835
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:20,820
And your only choice is
to use the accelerator

2836
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,700
just to coach through it.

2837
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:22,970
That's essentially what's happening

2838
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:24,500
to these neural circuits.

2839
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,420
So, the work of Dr. Halpern and others,

2840
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:28,170
I think is really exciting.

2841
02:03:28,170 --> 02:03:29,870
And even though it's highly invasive,

2842
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:33,240
I think is going to lead
to not just some relief

2843
02:03:34,081 --> 02:03:36,407
for the patients that do get
that deep brain stimulation,

2844
02:03:36,407 --> 02:03:38,410
but also the identification
of what sorts of receptors

2845
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:39,845
are present in those brain areas.

2846
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:41,520
That could help.

2847
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:45,290
What that means is that once
we understand which brain areas

2848
02:03:46,688 --> 02:03:49,260
are involved in disorder, and
we understand what receptors,

2849
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:51,430
those brain areas express,

2850
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:54,120
then there can start to be
additional interventions

2851
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:56,880
by way of non invasive treatments,

2852
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,850
things like drug treatments,

2853
02:03:58,850 --> 02:04:01,400
do behavioral interventions
work for bulimia?

2854
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,365
In some cases, yes,

2855
02:04:02,365 --> 02:04:06,173
provided that those interventions
are done early enough.

2856
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,360
Regardless, behavioral interventions,

2857
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:11,070
coupled with drug based interventions

2858
02:04:11,070 --> 02:04:13,370
are always more effective
than either one alone.

2859
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:17,150
Fortunately, there is a
decent size kit of drugs

2860
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:18,120
that can help with bulimia.

2861
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:19,650
I mentioned some of them before things

2862
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:23,490
like bupropion, Welbutrin
some of the serotonergic drugs

2863
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:26,160
and some of the drugs
used to treat impulsivity.

2864
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:29,860
So, we have on the one hand anorexia,

2865
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:32,720
which seems to be a disruption
in habit and a coupling

2866
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:35,710
of unhealthy habits in this case,

2867
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:39,210
food restriction to the reward pathway.

2868
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:40,410
And on the flip side,

2869
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:42,830
we have binge eating disorder and bulimia

2870
02:04:42,830 --> 02:04:45,580
where a very unhealthy
habit of gorging oneself

2871
02:04:45,580 --> 02:04:48,110
with food sometimes followed by purging,

2872
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:49,980
is not necessarily coupled to reward.

2873
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:52,040
They feel terrible when
they do that, right?

2874
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:54,000
The anorexic feels great about restricting

2875
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,960
their food intake.

2876
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,050
They feel like they're
winning some sort of game.

2877
02:04:57,050 --> 02:04:59,765
The circuitry is flipped somehow that way.

2878
02:04:59,765 --> 02:05:03,810
With bulimia they feel
horrible about the fact

2879
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:06,010
that they're bingeing,
there's immense shame.

2880
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:08,070
They can't control themselves.

2881
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:10,980
The reward is set up before the behavior,

2882
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:15,050
the reward is set up
in drawing them to food

2883
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:17,150
and in making food look like something

2884
02:05:17,150 --> 02:05:21,460
that's incredibly appetizing
and there's no impulse break.

2885
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:24,140
There's no way for them to
stop that kind of behavior.

2886
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:26,210
So, really kind of troubling
thing to think about.

2887
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:27,600
In either case,

2888
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,050
I think for those of
us that know anorexics

2889
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:31,423
or have observed anorexia,

2890
02:05:31,423 --> 02:05:34,130
it's so hard to see
somebody starved themselves

2891
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:35,700
to near death or to death.

2892
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,810
What more could be disturbing?

2893
02:05:37,810 --> 02:05:41,990
Well, equally disturbing is
somebody who has an abundance

2894
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:43,560
of food and is gorging themselves,

2895
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:45,406
and then feels terrible about it.

2896
02:05:45,406 --> 02:05:48,475
So, these are heavy topics.

2897
02:05:48,475 --> 02:05:52,380
These are topics that
frankly no one really wants

2898
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,440
to talk about unless they
know someone who is suffering

2899
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:56,980
from them, or they
themselves suffer from them.

2900
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:59,234
What I've tried to do today
is try and give you a window

2901
02:05:59,234 --> 02:06:02,740
into what really underlies these things

2902
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:05,120
that we call eating disorders.

2903
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:06,410
I hope I've done that at the level

2904
02:06:06,410 --> 02:06:09,650
of biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology,

2905
02:06:09,650 --> 02:06:11,163
and some of the psychology,

2906
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:14,140
as with any episode of this podcast.

2907
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:16,140
But especially in this
month where we're talking

2908
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:19,360
about mental health issues
and mental health disorders,

2909
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:23,250
behavioral disorders, there's
no way that I can exhaustively

2910
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:25,140
cover all the different
forms of treatment.

2911
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:26,460
You have the modely approach,

2912
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:29,260
you've got all these different
approaches to depression,

2913
02:06:30,610 --> 02:06:31,630
into anorexia, et cetera.

2914
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:33,900
What I've tried to do
is give you a framework.

2915
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:34,733
And in doing that,

2916
02:06:34,733 --> 02:06:36,700
I've tried to give you a
framework of understanding

2917
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:39,120
that also applies to this question.

2918
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:42,580
That's I think equally
important and goes alongside

2919
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:43,820
the treatment of eating disorders

2920
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:46,260
is what in the world is healthy eating.

2921
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:48,690
What in the world is a
healthy relationship to food.

2922
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:50,170
I like to think that I have a
healthy relationship to food.

2923
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:52,220
I know the foods I like.

2924
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:53,260
I enjoy them.

2925
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:56,120
They're 10 or 15 foods in
particular that I liked very much.

2926
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:58,250
I've mentioned a few of
them on the podcast before,

2927
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:03,250
and I was sort of amused,
surprised and perplexed as to why.

2928
02:07:04,490 --> 02:07:07,720
For instance, I do enjoy eating
butter, not in huge amounts,

2929
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,340
but I do like butter.

2930
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:12,393
So, that seemed to be pretty
triggering for folks out there.

2931
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,520
A small selection of people
decided that the ingestion

2932
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:17,500
of butter was a health concern.

2933
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:20,090
Look to me,

2934
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:23,100
ingesting butter in small
quantities is something

2935
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:23,960
that I'm comfortable with.

2936
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:26,290
And my blood lipid profiles feel good.

2937
02:07:26,290 --> 02:07:27,750
They look good to me.

2938
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:29,980
For other people that
might not be the case.

2939
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:30,813
For some people.

2940
02:07:30,813 --> 02:07:34,580
The idea of eating an
animal-based food is probably

2941
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:37,700
so repulsive that it actually

2942
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:39,390
can make them feel physically sick.

2943
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:42,410
And I think that we should
be aware that that kind

2944
02:07:42,410 --> 02:07:43,840
of mental phenotype exists.

2945
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,710
I'm not calling it a pathology
for other people like myself,

2946
02:07:46,710 --> 02:07:48,890
things like butter and meat feel healthy.

2947
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:50,020
Now, what quantities?

2948
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:51,930
Well, I enjoy eating very much.

2949
02:07:51,930 --> 02:07:52,900
I'm not shy about this.

2950
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:55,744
I've talked about on the
podcast before, I enjoy eating.

2951
02:07:55,744 --> 02:08:00,110
Some people have a very
complicated relationship to food.

2952
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:01,760
They don't think of it as nourishment.

2953
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:02,960
They don't enjoy it socially.

2954
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:05,570
It's a stressful thing for them based

2955
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:06,960
on their personal history,

2956
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:10,760
or maybe just general anxiety around food.

2957
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:13,970
And I hope that in sharing
this information about the fact

2958
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:18,280
that anytime we approach food,
these neurons in our hype,

2959
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:21,130
in the arcuate area of our
hypothalamus actually increase

2960
02:08:22,050 --> 02:08:23,051
our levels of anxiety.

2961
02:08:23,051 --> 02:08:24,930
This is related to that
point that Dr. Halpern made,

2962
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:27,018
which was that from an
evolutionary standpoint,

2963
02:08:27,018 --> 02:08:30,170
it is advantageous to ingest as much food

2964
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:32,560
as often as possible,
as quickly as possible.

2965
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,300
We now know that to not be
healthy in this age of abundance,

2966
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:39,580
where calories are essentially everywhere.

2967
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:44,580
And yet a lot of people
feel anxious in anticipation

2968
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:46,313
of a meal.

2969
02:08:46,313 --> 02:08:47,380
What could be useful to them?

2970
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:50,270
Well, whether or not they have
an eating disorder or not.

2971
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:53,970
It's very clear that developing
methods to calm oneself

2972
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:57,140
in the presence of any anxiety
or fear inducing stimulus

2973
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:57,990
can be beneficial.

2974
02:08:57,990 --> 02:09:00,850
I've talked about some of these
episodes related to stress,

2975
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:02,840
things like the physiological
side to inhale through

2976
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,153
the nose and a long exhale,

2977
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:07,250
things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help.

2978
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:09,260
There are data, a lot of
studies out there showing

2979
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:11,510
that meditation practice
can help people deal

2980
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:14,510
with eating related anxiety and disorders.

2981
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,640
I think as a general rule,

2982
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:18,730
trying to avoid approaching
a meal or sitting down

2983
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,980
to eat in an anxious state
is probably a good idea,

2984
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:22,910
but let's be realistic.

2985
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:24,000
How often can we do that?

2986
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,100
I think most of us are
going to have circumstances

2987
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:30,010
where we're rushing around
trying to just eat before we head

2988
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:31,210
out or get to a meal.

2989
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:32,473
And then we sit down and
we find ourselves eating.

2990
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:35,980
This is one of the first
times in human evolution

2991
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:40,980
where we mostly eat out of
a desire to consume food,

2992
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:43,140
not out of a need for food.

2993
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:46,540
Most everybody could
go a fairly long period

2994
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:49,300
of time, just ingesting
water and electrolytes.

2995
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:50,840
And not that I'm
suggesting people do that,

2996
02:09:50,840 --> 02:09:52,220
but let's face it.

2997
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:55,220
We largely eat nowadays
because of a desire to eat,

2998
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:56,760
not a need to eat,

2999
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:59,800
and yet we need to eat on
a fairly regular basis.

3000
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,540
And so no topic is more complicated

3001
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:06,570
and nuanced than food and nutrition.

3002
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:08,670
And in particular, as it
relates to eating disorders.

3003
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:12,030
So, the major takeaways today are,

3004
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:13,190
we should all be asking the question,

3005
02:10:13,190 --> 02:10:15,240
what is healthy eating for us?

3006
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:16,840
How do we develop a relationship

3007
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:20,640
to food that we can enjoy
food, hopefully both socially

3008
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:23,900
and on our own, but
that we are not neurotic

3009
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:24,910
and compulsive about it.

3010
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:26,550
For those of you that intermittent fast,

3011
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:28,200
this also applies, right?

3012
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,693
What, you know, God forbid,

3013
02:10:30,886 --> 02:10:32,090
if you eat 30 minutes before
your eating window starts,

3014
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:32,930
what does that mean?

3015
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:34,890
If it means something catastrophic,

3016
02:10:34,890 --> 02:10:36,060
do you have an eating disorder?

3017
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:37,448
I don't know.

3018
02:10:37,448 --> 02:10:38,700
Maybe you have an anxiety disorder,

3019
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:40,620
that's for you to explore.

3020
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:44,050
If you don't manage to
eat five meals a day

3021
02:10:44,050 --> 02:10:45,090
and that's your obsession.

3022
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:47,860
Well, then, you know,
the same thing applies.

3023
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:50,150
These are questions that
we can all ask ourselves.

3024
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:54,600
Today, we focus on the extremes
of food related behaviors

3025
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:57,970
that really qualify as genuine disorders.

3026
02:10:57,970 --> 02:11:01,940
They are in the psychiatric
manuals and they are diagnosable

3027
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:04,980
and they are serious health concerns.

3028
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:07,460
They're not just mentally
troubling and concerning

3029
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:08,477
for the people suffering from them

3030
02:11:08,477 --> 02:11:09,780
and the people around them,

3031
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:11,426
but they are genuine health concerns,

3032
02:11:11,426 --> 02:11:13,100
just want to reiterate,

3033
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:16,870
that interaction nervosa is
the most deadly psychiatric

3034
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:19,800
disorder by a huge margin.

3035
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:21,950
And if you look
statistically at the number

3036
02:11:21,950 --> 02:11:23,960
of people with eating
disorders and that die

3037
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,690
of eating disorders,

3038
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:27,730
it's not far off from the number of people

3039
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:29,536
that die from automobile accidents.

3040
02:11:29,536 --> 02:11:31,980
I know that that sounds
like a ridiculous number,

3041
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:33,498
but you can look this up.

3042
02:11:33,498 --> 02:11:36,100
This is particularly true in
certain countries, why that is,

3043
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:40,060
we don't know, but again,
this is not a new phenomenon.

3044
02:11:40,060 --> 02:11:44,480
This is not just related
to body image issues

3045
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,144
that are created through social media.

3046
02:11:46,144 --> 02:11:48,796
And as a final point on that,

3047
02:11:48,796 --> 02:11:53,600
many of you are probably asking
what about plastic surgery?

3048
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:56,557
What about all the steps that
people are going through?

3049
02:11:56,557 --> 02:11:59,490
Excuse me, to preen themselves
and change themselves.

3050
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:01,810
Are people addicted to plastic surgery?

3051
02:12:01,810 --> 02:12:04,000
Is that a form of body dysmorphia?

3052
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:04,933
And indeed it is.

3053
02:12:05,932 --> 02:12:08,480
And so we will do an
episode on exercise related

3054
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,950
and plastic surgery
related body dysmorphia.

3055
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:16,530
I think there is very little
question that those types

3056
02:12:16,530 --> 02:12:21,530
of disorders are clearly
related to what we're observing

3057
02:12:21,550 --> 02:12:23,660
in social media and in media,

3058
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:27,100
that this shift of, for
instance, action heroes.

3059
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:29,200
If you look at action heroes in the '80s,

3060
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,550
there were very few men
that were very large.

3061
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:32,383
You had your terminate,

3062
02:12:32,383 --> 02:12:34,920
you had your stallone's
in your shorts and eggers

3063
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:38,230
and a few others, but the
men in movies tended to be,

3064
02:12:38,230 --> 02:12:39,090
if they were muscular,

3065
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:41,700
they were far more
svelte than they are now.

3066
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,842
There's this kind of, there's a,

3067
02:12:43,842 --> 02:12:45,410
literally a hypertrophy of the imagery.

3068
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:48,520
And likewise there's been hypertrophy

3069
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,180
of the female body shape.

3070
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:51,530
As it's portrayed in the media.

3071
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:55,300
There are body dysmorphia that are related

3072
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:56,580
to those types of things.

3073
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:58,900
And that relate to things
like plastic surgery,

3074
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:03,540
steroid abuse, diet,
drug abuse, and so on.

3075
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:06,480
Definitely important to
think about and consider,

3076
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:08,665
and definitely deserving
of its own episode.

3077
02:13:08,665 --> 02:13:12,110
You've learned a lot
of neuroscience today.

3078
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:14,790
I hope that was useful in
thinking about these disorders

3079
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:17,440
and in thinking about
other aspects of feeding

3080
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,890
and motivated behaviors,

3081
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:21,730
I would love for you
to take away this model

3082
02:13:21,730 --> 02:13:22,700
that was handed off to me,

3083
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:24,500
that I think is so powerful for thinking

3084
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,550
about all sorts of
things, not just eating,

3085
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:28,300
but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions

3086
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:31,560
that you have one box for what you think,

3087
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:33,250
one box for what you do

3088
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:35,370
and what is intervening between those?

3089
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:37,558
Why is it that you can know
better and not do better?

3090
02:13:37,558 --> 02:13:40,730
Well it's because you also have to cope

3091
02:13:40,730 --> 02:13:43,660
with the subconscious
homeostatic processes

3092
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:45,070
and reward processes.

3093
02:13:45,070 --> 02:13:48,550
And those oftentimes
can be disrupted in ways

3094
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:51,900
that we find ourselves doing
things that are not good

3095
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,290
for us or not good for other people.

3096
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:55,319
But fortunately, there is this great gift,

3097
02:13:55,319 --> 02:13:58,880
which is that knowledge
of knowledge can allow you

3098
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:01,580
to do better without question.

3099
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:05,550
And that knowledge of knowledge
allowing you to do better

3100
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:08,040
over time leads to this
incredible phenomenon

3101
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:10,770
called neuroplasticity, which
essentially is translated

3102
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:13,030
into doing better over time.

3103
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:16,930
Even if difficult eventually
makes doing better reflexive.

3104
02:14:16,930 --> 02:14:19,610

And if you'd like to
support research on stress,

3118
02:14:49,670 --> 02:14:52,260
human performance, sleep and so forth,

3119
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:55,550
you can go to a hubermanlab.stanford.edu.

3120

If you'd like to make a
tax deductible donation

3122
02:15:00,418 --> 02:15:01,670
to the laboratory,

3123
02:15:01,670 --> 02:15:03,640
to explore the sorts of things that relate

3124
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:06,970
to neurocircuits stress,
sleep and human performance.

3125
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:09,370
Not today, but oftentimes on this podcast,

3126
02:15:09,370 --> 02:15:11,550
we discuss various
compounds and supplements

3127
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:16,010
that people could possibly
take in order to help deal

3128
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:18,480
with anxiety, improve gut microbiome,

3129
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,460
improve their sleep, et cetera.

3130
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,540
We didn't discuss those today,

3131
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:23,310
but for those of you
interested in those compounds,

3132
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:25,180
if you want to see the ones that I take,

3133
02:15:25,180 --> 02:15:28,887
you can go to Thorne that's T-H-O-R-N-E

3134
02:15:28,887 --> 02:15:32,373
.com/the letter U/huberman.

3135
02:15:33,546 --> 02:15:35,940
So, it's thorne.com/u/huberman.

3136
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:37,340
See all the supplements that I take,

3137
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:39,600
you get 20% off any of those supplements.

3138
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:42,414
And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

3139
02:15:42,414 --> 02:15:45,090
you can get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes

3140
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:46,290
we partnered with Thorne

3141
02:15:47,422 --> 02:15:48,255
because they have the highest levels

3142
02:15:48,255 --> 02:15:51,330
of stringency with respect to
the quality of ingredients,

3143
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:53,740
the precision of the amounts
of those ingredients.

3144
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:55,770
And while supplements are
certainly not required

3145
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:58,340
or necessary for anything really,

3146
02:15:58,340 --> 02:15:59,660
you can always use behavioral tools.

3147
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:01,300
Many people benefit
from taking supplements

3148
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,200
of various kinds.

3149
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:04,000
And we do believe that getting supplements

3150
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,140
of the very highest quality
is going to be important

3151
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:08,490
if that's the decision for you.

3152
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:10,090
And last but not least,

3153
02:16:10,090 --> 02:16:12,510
I want to thank you for
your time and attention.

3154
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:14,062
And thank you for your
interest in science.
