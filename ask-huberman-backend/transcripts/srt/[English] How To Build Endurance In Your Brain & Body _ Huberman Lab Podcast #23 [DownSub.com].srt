00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,350
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,973
for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,320
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,280
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,030
This podcast is separate from my teaching

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,710
and research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,930
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,800
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,900
and science-related tools
to the general public.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,170
In keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,280
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,460
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,070
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses.

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,980
And I'm delighted that they're a partner

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,100
and a sponsor for the podcast.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,070
As some of you may already
know I've spent two decades

19
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,020
or more studying the visual system,

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,853
how we see?

21
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:48,520
Vision is absolutely
the most important sense

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,040
by which humans navigate
the world and survive.

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,270
And our eyes as two pieces of our brain

24
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,490
do many other important things as well.

25
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,450
So taking good care of
our eyesight is essential.

26
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,330
Founded by two All-Americans
swimmers from Stanford.

27
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,370
ROKA was born out of an
obsession for performance.

28
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,880
They've carefully put science and purpose

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,220
behind their design choices

30
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,250
and they built absolutely
terrific products as a result.

31
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,230
The glasses are amazing.

32
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,990
I love them because they look great.

33
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,300
They are super comfortable

34
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,210
and the optical clarity is incredible.

35
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,813
They filter out sunlight in a way

36
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,380
that still allows you to
see contrast and shadows

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,213
the way you need to.

38
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,010
And for me, one of the things
that's really irritating

39
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,720
is if I have a pair of sunglasses

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,690
that don't allow me to see
all the things I want to see.

41
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,560
And with ROKA glasses,

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,570
I get incredible contrast
but then I can also relax

43
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,080
and be outdoors in bright light.

44
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,600
And as the amount of light
changes with cloud cover

45
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,990
and things of that sort,

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,560
my ability to see my surroundings

47
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,147
coz it's still really
sharp and really clear.

48
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,510
And that only comes from
really understanding

49
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,910
how the visual system works,

50
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,630
and how it adjusts to
contrast and adaptation

51
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,480
and all these different things.

52
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,160
They really understand the science

53
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,690
and that went into the
design of these glasses.

54
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,130
And as many of you know,

55
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,970
sunlight and the viewing of light

56
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,710
is also very important for
setting circadian rhythm.

57
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,410
So that's also been incorporated
into the design and science

58
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,770
behind these glasses.

59
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,890
I do wear readers.

60
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,860
I don't often wear them
during the podcast,

61
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,550
but I have to wear
reading glasses at night.

62
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,990
So I use their readers and I
own a pair of their sunglasses.

63
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,750
And I'm delighted with them.

64
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,660

Today's podcast is also brought
to you by InsideTracker.

72
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,260
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

73
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,710
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

74
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,260
to help you better understand your body

75
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,090
and reach your health goals.

76
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,870
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done

77
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,240
for the simple reason that
many of the important things

78
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,570
that are vital to our
immediate and long-term health

79
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,300
can only be detected in a
good quality blood test.

80
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,350
The problem with blood tests
is that most blood tests

81
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,960
you get a lot of information
back about that are too high

82
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,970
or too low of this thing
or the other thing.

83
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,947
But making sense of that,

84
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:05,630
and what to do with that
information is very challenging.

85
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,180
Even if you have a really
attentive physician,

86
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,930
oftentimes it's mysterious

87
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,840
as to what to do with all this data.

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,570
With InsideTracker, they make
it very easy to understand

89
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,080
what all the metabolic factors,
hormone factors, et cetera,

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,080
mean for you and what to
do about those markers.

91
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,810
So they offer you directives
in terms of nutrition,

92
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,800
supplementation, as well
as lifestyle factors

93
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,070
like exercise, sleep, et cetera,

94
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,470
that can allow you to take
control of those numbers

95
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,280
and bring them into the
ranges that are best for you

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,910
and your long-term health.

97
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,280
Another feature of InsideTracker

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,470
that's great is their inner age test.

99
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,530
This test shows you
what your biological age

100
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,700
and how it compares to
your chronological age,

101
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,760
which I can only imagine
most everybody including me

102
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,040
are extremely interested in
how long am I likely to live?

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,520
How old am I really in
terms of my biology?

104
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,100

Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

109
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,770
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

110
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,270
vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.

111
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,870
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012,

112
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,040
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

113
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,060
With athletic greens,

114
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,750
you get a ton of factors
that are good for you

115
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,210
mixed into this one
really good tasting drink.

116
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,640
I like to mix mine with water

117
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,020
and a little bit of lemon juice,

118
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,900
and I drink that once or twice a day.

119
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,770
Typically, once early in the day,

120
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,530
and sometimes also in the
afternoon or even evening.

121
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,690
I'm able to sleep after drinking
in the evening just fine.

122
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,400
The reason I been using
Athletic Greens for so long

123
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,030
that I continue to use
Athletic Greens is that,

124
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,860
one, I feel better when I take it.

125
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,693
I just do.

126
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,950
Psychologically,
physically, I feel better.

127
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,700
But also it covers all
my bases of the things

128
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,780
that I need for my general health.

129
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,530
It's sort of a foundational
supplement as I like to call it.

130
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,820
In fact, when people ask me,

131
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,430
what should I take?

132
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,230
If I were to recommend just one supplement

133
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,000
that people take it
would be Athletic Greens.

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,670
With Athletic Greens, you
get support for your gut

135
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,610
which is important,

136
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,297
because the gut microbiome is important

137
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,920
for the gut brain access,
for mood, metabolism,

138
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,830
hormones, et cetera.

139
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,490
There are so many data that
support that statement.

140
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,870
As well, there are many
factors in Athletic Greens

141
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,920
that support general health metabolism,

142
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,520
endocrine factors, immunity, et cetera.

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,030
So with Athletic Greens, I
drink it once or twice a day.

144
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,180
And I know that I've got all that covered.

145
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,650
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

146
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,820
you can go to

plus a year supplies, excuse me,

150
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,520
of vitamin D3+K2.

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,590
So you get the five free travel packs

152
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,930
and a year supply of D3

153
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,040
if you go to
www.athleticgreens.com/huberman

154
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,790
you can claim that special offer.

155
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,380
For the last month four
episodes to be exact,

156
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,520
we've been discussing physical performance

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,450
and skill learning.

158
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,080
We've talked about how
to learn skills faster,

159
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,100
whether or not those are
skills, athletic performance,

160
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,210
dance, music, things of that sort.

161
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,450
We've also talked about
how to gain strength

162
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,010
and how to lose fat faster by
leveraging the nervous system.

163
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,330
Things like shiver and non-shiver,

164
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,490
non-exercise activity
induced thermogenesis.

165
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,260
We talked about how neurons
can actually trigger

166
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,200
accelerated fat loss.

167
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,490
We talked about hypertrophy
also called muscle growth

168
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,280
and we covered everything
from sets and reps protocols,

169
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,170
how long to stay in a cold ice bath?

170
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,390
When to get out?

171
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,760
How to keep shivering?

172
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,760
We've covered a lot of
tools and a lot of science.

173
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,120
So if you're interested in those things

174
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,400
and you even perhaps want
to learn a little bit about

175
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,510
how we make energy ATP from
carbohydrates or from fats,

176
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,320
it's all covered in the
previous four episodes.

177
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,570
This was going to be the time

178
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,540
that we moved to a new topic entirely,

179
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,510
but we are going to do one
more episode in this series

180
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,840
on physical performance.

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,580
For the simple reason that
you asked many questions

182
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,710
about something that's vitally important

183
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,270
both for physical
performance and long-term

184
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,010
and short-term health
and that's endurance.

185
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,920
And so today we are going
to talk about endurance.

186
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,860
Now, if you're a strength athlete

187
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,390
or you're not interested in endurance,

188
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,710
don't depart just yet,

189
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,660
because it turns out that there
are ways to train endurance

190
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,420
that are very different

191
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,320
than I would have previously imagined.

192
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,660
If you only think about long runs,

193
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,800
long swims, marathons,
half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks

194
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,710
and that sort of thing puts you to sleep

195
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,620
kind of like Costello is
snoring in the background

196
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,790
right now.

197
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,450
He's not a long distance
endurance athlete,

198
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,303
that's for sure.

199
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,050
If you're interested in those things

200
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,550
or if you are averse to those things,

201
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,380
I encourage you to continue listening

202
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,320
because we are going to talk
about a little bit of science

203
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,180
and then some specific protocols

204
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,640
that really define what endurance is?

205
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,220
The four types of endurance

206
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,230
and ways to train those in
concert with the other things

207
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,180
that you might be doing
like weight training

208
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,350
or skill training or yoga.

209
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,380
And if you are an endurance athlete,

210
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,320
we are going to cover a
lot of tools and science

211
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,140
that I'm certain will also
help enhance your training

212
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,170
and performance in races

213
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,490
or even just recreationally.

214
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,990
The topic of endurance I think

215
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,160
has been badly misrepresented,
frankly, online.

216
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,200
And when you'd start
digging into the science

217
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,290
and you start talking to
real experts in this area,

218
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,530
what you discover, what
I've discovered is that,

219
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,410
it's an incredibly interesting area

220
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,590
because it teaches us so
much about how our body

221
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,590
and our brain use fuels and
how we can control which fuels

222
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,539
are used by our body and brain?

223
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,990
So today we will talk about
the four kinds of endurance.

224
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,870
We will also cover the topic of hydration

225
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,560
which might sound incredibly boring.

226
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,400
Like, okay, just drink more water.

227
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,950
But it's really interesting

228
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,800
because not only is
hydration a limiting factor

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,633
on performance,

230
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,170
but there is a right way to hydrate,

231
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,240
and there is a wrong way to hydrate.

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,700
There actually is a formula

233
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,840
that I'll teach you to know
how much water to be drinking

234
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,350
depending on your activity levels.

235
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,850
And if that sounds like a simple thing,

236
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,070
like, oh, just tap off water
until your urine runs clear.

237
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,400
That's actually the wrong advice.

238
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,450
It turns out that if you
don't hydrate properly,

239
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,450
you can see 20 to 30%
reductions in performance,

240
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,040
whether or not that strength,

241
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,580
whether that's increasing hypertrophy,

242
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,320
whether or not that's running, swimming,

243
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,140
even mental performance.

244
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,740
So even if you're not an athlete

245
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,500
or a recreational athlete at all,

246
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,930
I encourage you to stay tuned
for the part about hydration.

247
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,760
So we're going to cover as
usual a little bit of science

248
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,020
and then we're going to
dive right into protocols

249
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,427
that you can apply if you like,

250
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:48,940
and if you deem those
correct and safe for you.

251
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,180
Before we dive into all that,

252
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,670
I want to make an important announcement,

253
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,890
which has all the episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast

254
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,430
are now housed on a single website,

255
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,910
which is www.hubermanlab.com.

256
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,700
If you go to www.hubermanlab.com,

257
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,140
you can find all the episodes in YouTube,

258
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,130
Apple and Spotify format with links there.

259
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,870
The website is also searchable.

260
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,770
So if you go into the
little search function

261
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,890
which you'll find very easily,

262
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,510
and you put in, for
instance, creatine or sleep

263
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,730
or ice bath or sauna,

264
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,650
it will take you to the specific episodes

265
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,970
that contain that information.

266
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,530
And in addition, if you go to the website

267
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,410
www.hubermanlab.com,

268
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,520
you have the opportunity to sign up

269
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,700
for what we call the
Huberman Lab Neural Network.

270
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,590
The Huberman Lab Neural
Network is a zero cost resource

271
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,420
where once a month perhaps more often

272
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,310
you'll receive a email newsletter,

273
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,340
and that newsletter will
contain specific protocols,

274
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,030
announcements, attachments of
PDFs and things of that sort

275
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,000
of protocols, tools and
science from the podcast.

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,190
We will also make any
announcements about live lectures

277
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,950
which at some point I'll
probably start doing

278
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,610
in various cities in the US

279
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,550
and probably around the world as well,

280
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,240
as well as other things that I think

281
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,740
would be really useful to you
all of course at zero cost.

282
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,580
So that's www.hubermanlab.com,

283
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,020
sign up for the Neural Network newsletter.

284
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,590
You can find that in the menu tab

285
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,480
or it might pop up when you get there.

286
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,040
And I hope you will join.

287
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,990
And as a final announcement,

288
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,610
if you're not already
following us on Instagram,

289
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,600
you can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram.

290
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,620
And if you do that,

291
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,250
I often make announcements
and release protocols

292
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,340
and links to protocols
and things there as well.

293
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,760
I briefly want to touch on something

294
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,130
from the previous episode which is that,

295
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,430
if you are somebody that is trying

296
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,510
to increase muscle strength and or size,

297
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,270
or if you're simply somebody

298
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,490
who doesn't want to increase
muscle strength and size,

299
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,960
and you just want to maintain
the musculature that you have,

300
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,690
it's vital that you
perform at least five sets

301
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,270
of resistance training
per muscle per week.

302
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,180
If we don't do that, we
lose muscle over time.

303
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,030
And that is one reason among many

304
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,750
to have a regular resistance
training protocol.

305
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,350
Nobody wants to start resembling
a folded over envelope

306
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,330
or a melted candle.

307
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,770
No one wants to have challenges
getting up out of a chair

308
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,330
or off the ground.

309
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,300
Maintaining musculature is vital,

310
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,030
not just to our immediate health,

311
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,810
but to our long-term health trajectory.

312
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,430
So I just want to emphasize that point.

313
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,730
If you're curious about
the sets, the reps,

314
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,550
how close to failure to go or not go?

315
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,380
Whether or not you should be doing

316
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,130
your cardiovascular training

317
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,700
before or after your weight training?

318
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,630
All of that is in the previous episode

319
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,840
right down to the details,

320
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,190
and I like to think made
simple for you to understand.

321
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,890
But I do strongly believe
that resistance training

322
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,240
whether or not it's with body
weight or bands or weights

323
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,930
or simply lifting rocks in
the yard or logs in the yard

324
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,330
is vital for our systemic
physiology and our overall health,

325
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,870
and that includes our brain health.

326
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,140
And I described the reasons
for that and the mechanisms

327
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,620
in the previous episode.

328
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,810
Today, I'd like to talk about endurance

329
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,050
and how to build endurance,

330
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,253
and how to use endurance for
the health of your entire body.

331
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,080
Endurance, as the name suggests
is our ability to engage

332
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,800
in continuous bouts of exercise,

333
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,800
or continuous movement or
continuous effort of any kind.

334
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,080
And I do believe that our
ability to engage in activities

335
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,870
that we call endurance training

336
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,240
or physical endurance activities

337
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,240
do have carry over to
mental performance of things

338
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,320
that require long-term effort.

339
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,610
I'll touch on that at the end

340
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,650
and why there's reason to believe

341
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,600
that there is a biological crossover

342
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,620
between those two things.

343
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,950
I don't think it's simply the case

344
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,407
that if you train
yourself to be a strength

345
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,120
and speed athlete and to
do short bouts of exercise

346
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,260
are very intense,

347
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,540
that you can only do mental work

348
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,550
that's of short bouts and very intense.

349
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,540
But it is clear that
cardiovascular exercise,

350
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,610
exercise where you're
getting your heart rate up

351
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,320
continuously for a period of time,

352
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,270
and endurance exercise we will define

353
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,890
what that is in a moment,

354
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,410
is vital for tapping into
and enhancing various aspects

355
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,040
of our biology in the
body end in the brain

356
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,640
such that our brain can perform work

357
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,120
for longer periods of time,

358
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,960
focused work, learning, et cetera.

359
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,530
So I want to dive into
the topic of endurance

360
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,260
and I want to just begin
by addressing something

361
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,030
that's vital to any kind of effort,

362
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,240
whether that's mental
effort or physical effort.

363
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,720
So as always a little bit of science

364
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,870
and we'll get right into protocols.

365
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,470
So the key thing to understand

366
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,580
about energy production in the body,

367
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,130
meaning your ability to think,

368
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,530
your ability to talk,
your ability to walk,

369
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,060
your ability to run is this
thing that we call ATP.

370
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,030
ATP and mitochondria,
which are just little

371
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,120
what we call organelles within cells.

372
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,423
These little factories that
make energy, if you will.

373
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,050
ATP is required for anything
that requires energy,

374
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,920
for anything that you
do that requires effort.

375
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,340
And there are different ways to get ATP.

376
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,870
And we have been gifted as
a species with the ability

377
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,060
to convert lots of things into ATP.

378
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,720
We can convert carbohydrates,

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,690
literally the kinds of
carbohydrates eat a bagel,

380
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,800
you eat a piece of pizza.

381
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,760
Pizza usually is dough, and it has cheese

382
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,390
and some other things.

383
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,760
Costello hears me talking about pizza.

384
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,410
Costello loves pizza, by the way.

385
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,450
Eating a piece of pizza,

386
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,080
it gets converted into various things,

387
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,990
fatty acids from the fats,
glucose from the bread,

388
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,990
and those things get converted
into ATP within cells,

389
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,270
through things like like
glycolysis, things like lipolysis.

390
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,290
I talked about this in previous episodes.

391
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,290
So our muscles and our neurons
use different fuel sources

392
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,173
to generate ATP.

393
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,320
The ones that are used
first for short bouts

394
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,920
of intense activity are
things like phosphocreatine.

395
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
If you've only heard about
creatine as a supplement.

396
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,347
Well, phosphocreatine actually
exists on our muscles,

397
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:16,920
and that's why people take creatine.

398
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,120
You can load your muscles
with more creatine.

399
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,900
And though, and excuse me.

400
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,540
Phosphocreatine is great for
short, intense bouts of effort.

401
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,900
So when you're really pushing
hard on something physical,

402
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,830
let's say you see a car
on the side of the road

403
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,847
and that car is stalled and a person says,

404
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,200
"Hey, can you help me push my car?"

405
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,659
And you start to push.

406
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,550
That's going to be phosphocreatine

407
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,340
is going to be your main fuel source.

408
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,990
Then you start to tap
into things like glucose

409
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,360
which is literally just
carbohydrate is the sugar

410
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,810
that's in your blood.

411
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,040
And then if you keep pushing on that car,

412
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,450
you keep engaging in a particular effort,

413
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,610
or you keep studying or you
keep listening to this podcast,

414
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,810
you start to tap into other
fuel sources like glycogen

415
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,090
from your liver, which is just,

416
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,450
it's like a little pack,

417
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,590
just like you might have packed a sandwich

418
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,390
or something for work.

419
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,619
You have a little pack
of glycogen in your liver

420
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,219
that you can rely on.

421
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,869
And you have fat stored in adipose tissue.

422
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:13,099
Even if you have very, very
low body fat percentage

423
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,499
like you're one of these people
as like 3% or 5% body fat

424
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,290
really thin skin, very little body fat,

425
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,869
you can extract lipids fatty
acids from that body fat.

426
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,039
It's like a storage pack,

427
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,680
it is a storage pack for energy

428
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,470
that can be converted to ATP.

429
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,090
So without going into any more detail,

430
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,990
when I say today energy or I say ATP,

431
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,740
just remember that
regardless of your diet,

432
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,920
regardless of your nutritional plan,

433
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,810
your body has the
capacity to use creatine,

434
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,270
glucose, glycogen, lipids.

435
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,840
And if you're ketogenic, ketones.

436
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,890
We'll talk about ketosis.

437
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,683
In order to generate fuel, energy.

438
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,620
Now, the other crucial point is that,

439
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,100
in order to complete that
process of taking these fuels

440
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,700
and converting them into energy,

441
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,963
most of the time you need oxygen.

442
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,350
You need air basically in your system.

443
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,410
Now, it's not actual air.

444
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,500
You need oxygen molecules in your system,

445
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,410
comes in through your mouth and your nose,

446
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,140
goes to your lungs and
distributes via the bloodstream.

447
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,770
Oxygen is not a fuel,

448
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,900
but like a fire that has no oxygen

449
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,940
you can't actually burn the logs,

450
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,210
but when you blow a lot
of oxygen onto a fire,

451
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,560
basically, onto logs with a flame there,

452
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,283
then basically it will take fire,

453
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,593
it will burn.

454
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:42,426
Okay?

455
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:45,170
Oxygen allows you to burn fuel.

456
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,090
So today we are going to
ask the critical questions.

457
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,840
What allows us to perform?

458
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,000
What allows us to continue
effort for long periods of time?

459
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,650
And that effort could be a run,

460
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,730
it could be a swim,

461
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,210
it could be studying,

462
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,410
it could be anything that extends

463
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,620
over a long period of time.

464
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,360
Well, you're going to need energy

465
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,540
and you're going to need oxygen.

466
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,950
But the way to answer a question

467
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,360
like what allows us to endure, right?

468
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,193
Endurance.

469
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,710
What allows us to keep going?

470
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,690
Well, we think of things like willpower.

471
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,523
But what's willpower?

472
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:22,140
Willpower is neurons.

473
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,960
It's neurons in our brain.

474
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,590
We have this thing called
the central governor

475
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,610
which decides whether or not
we should or could continue

476
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,160
or whether or not we should stop,

477
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,930
whether or not we should quit.

478
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,763
Okay?

479
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:34,810
So whether or not you're somebody

480
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,910
who has a lot of what
we would call resilience

481
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,743
and endurance,

482
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,990
or whether or not you're
somebody who taps out early

483
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,190
and quits early or can't
handle frustration,

484
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,460
that has to do with your fuel utilization

485
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,810
and specific neurons.

486
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,960
So we have to ask the question,

487
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,100
what is the limiting
factor on performance?

488
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,933
Right?

489
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,830
So instead of saying,
what allows us to endure?

490
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,580
We should say, what
prevents us from enduring?

491
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,530
What prevents us from moving forward?

492
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,360
What are the factors that say,

493
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,230
you know what?

494
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,810
No more, I'm not going
to continue this run.

495
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,070
Or you know what?

496
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,040
I've had a really long, hard day

497
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,030
or maybe I've had an easy
day or I'm feeling lazy,

498
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,640
I just don't even really feel
like getting up and moving.

499
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,870
So what we're going to talk about today

500
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,760
actually gets right down
to the heart of motivation

501
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,800
and fuel use.

502
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,480
Motivation and fuel allocation.

503
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,280
And we are going to talk about
specific training protocols

504
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,700
that you can follow that have carry over

505
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,220
between the bodily systems of
running swimming, et cetera,

506
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,360
and the way that your brain works.

507
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,900
So let's talk about
endurance by asking first,

508
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,860
what are the limiting
factors on endurance?

509
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,660
What stops us?

510
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,920
Because in addressing
that and answering that,

511
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,780
we will understand what
allows us to get into effort

512
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,360
and to continue effort.

513
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,765
There are five main categories of things

514
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:51,870
that allow us to engage in effort.

515
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,870
And they are neurons, nerves, muscle,

516
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,610
muscle, blood, things in our blood,

517
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,670
our heart and our lungs.

518
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,960
Now, I don't want to
completely write off things

519
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,020
like the immune system and
other systems of the body,

520
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,330
but nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs

521
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,370
are the five that I
want to focus on today,

522
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,010
because that's where most of the data are.

523
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,260
As we go forward into this,

524
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,170
I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,

525
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,247
who as with the last episode,

526
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:28,130
has been tremendously
helpful and informative

527
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,040
in terms of the exercise physiology.

528
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,840
He's a true expert.

529
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,970
He has a laboratory,

530
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,470
he's a full professor who
does work on muscle biopsy,

531
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,810
who understands the science,

532
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,930
but who also works with athletes

533
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,170
and works with recreational athletes,

534
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,320
professional athletes really understands

535
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,740
at a variety of levels how
all these systems work?

536
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,990
He's the person I consulted
with about today's episode,

537
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,860
although I did access
other literature as well.

538
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,060
And I'm going to mention a
key review for any of you,

539
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,500
afficionados, who really want
to get down into the weeds.

540
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,350
But I encourage you,
if you want more detail

541
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,280
to check out Dr. Andy
Galpin's YouTube page,

542
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,880
I think he's also on Twitter.

543
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,700
He's definitely on Instagram.

544
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,640
His content is excellent,

545
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,005
and he really understands...

546
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:13,190
I have learned and I really believe

547
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,370
that an intellectual is somebody

548
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,500
who understands a topic at multiple levels

549
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,600
of specificity of detail
and can communicate that.

550
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,670
And Andy is a true intellectual
of muscle physiology

551
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,810
and performance.

552
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,620
And if you hear the word intellectual

553
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,770
and you kind of back up
and cringe from that,

554
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,070
understand that he's also a practitioner.

555
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,300
So thank you, Andrew Galpin.

556
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Andy Galpin for your
support in these episodes

557
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,290
and we hope to have you as
a guest on the podcast soon.

558
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,210
So nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.

559
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,470
Let's talk about neurons
and how they work.

560
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,303
Okay?

561
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:51,160
But I want to tell you about an experiment

562
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,880
that's going to make it very clear

563
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,340
why quitting is a mental
thing not a physical thing.

564
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,010
So why do we quit?

565
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,590
Well, an experiment was
done a couple years ago

566
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,160
and was published in the journal Cell.

567
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,480
Cell Press journal, excellent journal

568
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,480
showing that there is a class
of neurons in our brain stem,

569
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,540
in the back of our brain that
if they shut off, we quit.

570
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Now, these neurons release epinephrin.

571
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,250
Epinephrin is adrenaline.

572
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,230
And anytime we are engaged
in effort of any kind,

573
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,730
we are releasing epinephrin.

574
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,960
Anytime we're awake really,
we are releasing epinephrin

575
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,893
into our brain.

576
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,740
In fact, this little roup of neurons

577
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,930
in the back of our brain is
called the locus coeruleus

578
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,980
if you like.

579
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,260
It's churning out epinephrin all the time,

580
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,970
but if something stresses us out,

581
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,880
it churns out more and then it acts

582
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,720
as kind of an alertness
signal for the whole brain.

583
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,830
We also of course have
adrenaline epinephrin

584
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,690
released in our body which
makes our body ready for things.

585
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,650
So think about epinephrin
as a readiness signal.

586
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,060
And when we are engaged in effort,

587
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,310
this readiness signal is
being churned into our brain.

588
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,030
When we relax and we're falling asleep,

589
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,963
epinephrin levels are low.

590
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,870
Okay, so they did a really
interesting experiment

591
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,870
where they had subjects
engage in bouts of effort

592
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,220
of trying to move forward toward a goal.

593
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,550
But they manipulated
the visual environment

594
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,520
with the stripes,

595
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,993
kind of like fences passing
on both sides of them.

596
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,340
And by doing that, they
could trick subjects

597
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,990
into thinking that their
effort was either allowing them

598
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,460
to move forward, right?

599
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,200
Because these rungs on the
fence were moving past,

600
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,880
or that their effort was futile

601
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,460
that they were no longer moving forward

602
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,310
because they would make
the runs move slowly

603
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,730
even though the subjects
were making a lot of effort

604
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,950
to move forward.

605
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,783
Okay?

606
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,400
So this is analogous or
similar to being on a treadmill

607
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,240
and you're trying to
walk on this treadmill

608
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,320
and you just can't move
the conveyor, right?

609
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,010
Or you're in virtual reality

610
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,470
and you're putting a ton of effort,

611
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,670
but it seems like you're
moving excruciatingly slow.

612
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,290
I had this experience
recently in real life.

613
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,450
I was doing a swim in the Pacific,

614
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,660
I was trying to go
south and I was swimming

615
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,080
and I was caught in a current,

616
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,200
not the cup that pulls you out to ocean.

617
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,370
And I kept looking to my left,

618
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,100
and I saw this hotel on the shoreline,

619
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,860
and then I was swimming and swimming

620
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,780
and swimming and swimming,

621
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,250
and 20 minutes later I looked
to my left and the hotel

622
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,190
is still exactly where it was before,

623
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,440
which meant that I wasn't moving.

624
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,573
It felt futile.

625
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,350
Eventually, either the current
changed or something changed

626
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,670
and I eventually swam past the hotel,

627
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,213
got back on the beach and
eventually drove home.

628
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,180
That's essentially what
they did in this experiment.

629
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,500
But what they found was these neurons

630
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,993
that release epinephrin,

631
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,340
there's another cell type called glia,

632
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,310
which actually means glue in Latin,

633
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,510
that is paying attention
to how much epinephrin

634
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,343
is being released.

635
00:25:56,343 --> 00:26:00,090
And at some point the
system reaches a threshold.

636
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,380
It reaches this threshold

637
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,410
and it shuts off the
release of more epinephrin.

638
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,170
It's like I quit, that's it,

639
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,683
no more effort signal.

640
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,160
If they could extend the time

641
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,973
before those glia said, ah, enough.

642
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,340
If they could release more
adrenaline into the system,

643
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,670
then subjects would keep going.

644
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,670
So our desire to continue
or put differently,

645
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,490
our willingness to continue
and our desire to quit

646
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,470
is mediated by events
between our two ears.

647
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,580
Now, that doesn't mean that
the body's not involved,

648
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,710
but it means that neurons
are critically important.

649
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,950
So we have two categories of
neurons that are important.

650
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,040
The ones in our head that tell us get up

651
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,860
and go out and take that run.

652
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,840
And the ones that allow us
and encourage us to continue

653
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,673
that run,

654
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,200
and we have neurons that shut things off

655
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,400
and say no more.

656
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,950
And we of course have the neurons

657
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,670
that connect to our muscles
and control our muscles.

658
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,640
But the reason we quit is
rarely because our body quits,

659
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,540
our mind quits.

660
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,810
Now, we never want to encourage people

661
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,960
to drive themselves to
the point of injury,

662
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,460
that's not going to be good for anybody,

663
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,150
but it is good to know that it's neural.

664
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,060
Our ability to persist is neural.

665
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,530
So when people say is it, I hear that,

666
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,970
you know, sports or effort or fighting,

667
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,003
or it's 90% mental, 10% physical.

668
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,230
That whole discussion
about how much is mental,

669
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,063
how much is physical?

670
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,320
Is absolutely silly.

671
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,670
It just proves that there's no knowledge

672
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,390
of the underlying biology
behind that statement.

673
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,680
It's neither mental nor physical.

674
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,720
Everything is physical,

675
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,050
everything is neurons.

676
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,330
Your thinking is the
responsibility of chemicals

677
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,830
and electrical signals in your head.

678
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,910
So it's not 90% mental, 10% physical.

679
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,110
It's not 50/50.

680
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,900
It's not 70/30, it's 100% nervous system.

681
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,410
It's neurons.

682
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,243
Okay?

683
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:58,240
So when people say mental or physical,

684
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,090
understand it's 100% neural.

685
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,814
And I'd love for the,
how much of it is mental

686
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:06,593
and how much is physical
to just disappear.

687
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,720
That argument means nothing

688
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,070
and it's not actionable.

689
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,840
Now, what do nerves need in
order to continue to fire?

690
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,650
What do you need in order
to get neurons to say,

691
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,890
I will persist.

692
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,880
Well, they need glucose.

693
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,110
Unless you're on keto
and ketogenic adapted,

694
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,400
you need carbohydrate is glucose.

695
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,890
That's what neurons run on.

696
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,730
And you need electrolytes.

697
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,050
Neurons have what's called
a sodium potassium pump

698
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,883
blah, blah, blah.

699
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:36,840
They generate electricity.

700
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,820
We could go into all this.

701
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,090
I will probably do an entire lecture

702
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,070
about the action potential,

703
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,930
but basically in order to
get nerve cells to fire,

704
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,260
to contract muscle,

705
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,900
to say, I'm going to continue.

706
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,970
You need sufficient sodium, salt,

707
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,510
because the action potential
the actual firing of neurons

708
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,320
is driven by sodium entering the cell,

709
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,940
rushing into the cell.

710
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,930
And then there's a removal of potassium.

711
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,370
And then there's a kind of
resetting of those levels

712
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,090
by something called the
sodium potassium pump.

713
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,014
And the sodium potassium pump and sodium

714
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,890
and action potentials,

715
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,580
even if you don't know anything
about that is ATP dependent.

716
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,450
It requires energy.

717
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,573
So you need energy in order
to get neurons to fire.

718
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,270
And it is pH dependent.

719
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,560
It depends on the conditions

720
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,500
or the environment within the
brain being of a certain pH

721
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,580
or acidity.

722
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,050
pH is about how acid or how
basic the environment is?

723
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,280
And we will talk a little
bit about pH in simple terms

724
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,113
so you can understand.

725
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,820
So nerves need salt, they need potassium.

726
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,720
And it turns out they need magnesium

727
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,120
and you need glucose and carbohydrates

728
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,410
in order to power those neurons,

729
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,400
unless you are running on ketones.

730
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,860
And to run on ketones,

731
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,950
you have to make sure that
you're fully keto adapted.

732
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,560
I will talk about adding in
ketones on top of carbohydrate

733
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,340
at the end of the episode.

734
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,980
Okay, so that's how nerves work.

735
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,030
You need carbohydrate,

736
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,920
you need sodium, potassium and magnesium

737
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,263
in order to drive the brain.

738
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,063
Muscle.

739
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:08,830
Muscle is going to engage
in generating energy first

740
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,510
by using this phosphocreatine system.

741
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,080
High bouts of effort
really intense effort,

742
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,510
short-lived seconds to minutes,

743
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,700
but probably more like seconds

744
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,120
is going to be this phosphate
creating literally a fuel source

745
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,730
in the muscle that you're going to burn,

746
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,830
just like you would logs on a fire.

747
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,320
And glycogen which is stored
carbohydrate in the muscle,

748
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,730
that also can be burned
just like logs on a fire

749
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,700
to generate energy.

750
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,280
So let me make this crystal clear.

751
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,200
If you move your wrist
towards your shoulder

752
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,330
and contract your bicep really hard,

753
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,980
muscle fibers are burning
up their own carbohydrate.

754
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,800
They're converting that into ATP

755
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,040
in order to generate that energy.

756
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,030
Okay?

757
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:50,030
And pH is important and
temperature is important.

758
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,820
In the episode on supercharge
your physical performance,

759
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,780
I talked all about how by
using cooling specifically

760
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,730
of the palms or the bottoms of the feet

761
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,700
or the cheeks of the face
using particular methods,

762
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,700
you can adjust the temperature
of the body and of muscle

763
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,130
in a way that allows you to do more work,

764
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,470
to do more reps, to run further,

765
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,780
to keep going and to persist.

766
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,780
And that's because if temperature
is too low or too high,

767
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,010
then ATP is not going to be available

768
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,843
because of this whole thing

769
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,700
called the pyruvate kinase pathway

770
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,680
and the temperature
dependence of pyruvate kinase.

771
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,520
Check out that episode if you
want to learn more about that.

772
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,600
But temperature is important
and pH is also important.

773
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
So we got nerve, muscle,

774
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,550
and then there's stuff in our blood

775
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,850
that's available as an energy source.

776
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,410
And in blood, we got glucose.

777
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,240
So literally blood sugar
that's floating around.

778
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,470
So let's say you have
fasted for three days,

779
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,480
your blood glucose is
going to be very low.

780
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,820
So that's not going to
be a great fuel source,

781
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,720
but you will start to liberate fats

782
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,350
from your adipose tissue from your fat.

783
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,810
Fatty acids will start to
mobilize into the bloodstream

784
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,900
and you can burn those for energy.

785
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,680
And oxygen in your blood when
you inhale, [inhales deeply]

786
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,190
you're bringing oxygen into your blood.

787
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,410
So these are all fuel
sources in your neurons,

788
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,330
in your muscle, in your blood,

789
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:12,330
in your various tissues that
are providing the opportunity

790
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,530
to induce effort whether
or not it's a run or swim

791
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,290
or writing or talking.

792
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,890
Now, there are some other
factors that are important

793
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,130
and those are the heart
which is going to move blood.

794
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,030
So the more that the heart
can move blood and oxygen,

795
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,160
well, the more fuel that's
going to be available for you

796
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,230
to engage in muscular
effort and thinking effort.

797
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,670
So your heart vitally important
to your muscles ability

798
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,660
to work and your brain's ability to work.

799
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,690
And as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times,

800
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,040
it should be obvious then that
the lungs are very important.

801
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,710
You need to bring oxygen in,

802
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,700
and distribute it to all these tissues,

803
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,321
because oxygen is critical
for the conversion

804
00:32:55,321 --> 00:33:00,130
of carbohydrates and
the conversion of fats.

805
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,620
And we could get into the discussion about

806
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,540
whether or not oxygen is important
for ketogenic metabolism,

807
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,960
but you need oxygen there,

808
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,690
you need to breathe and you
need to breathe properly.

809
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,330
So I just covered what would
normally be about four lectures

810
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,990
of energy consumption
and energy utilization.

811
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,350
I didn't go into much detail at all.

812
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,470
But what I want you to imagine is that,

813
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,420
you've got these different cell types.

814
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,620
You've got neurons, you've got muscle,

815
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,480
they need to collaborate
in order to generate effort

816
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,210
or to make the decision to do something

817
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,110
or to think hard or to
run hard or to run far.

818
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,290
And then you've got fuel
sources both in the neurons,

819
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,290
in the muscle, in your blood,

820
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,990
and then the heart and
lungs are going to help

821
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,763
distribute the oxygen and those fuels.

822
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,570
And of course you have
that little energy pack

823
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,140
that we call the liver that
will allow you to pull out

824
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,340
a little more carbohydrate
if you need it for work.

825
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,173
Okay?

826
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:59,210
So that's as much as I want to
cover about energy consumption,

827
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,900
because that's a lot.

828
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,060
But what it tells you is that when you eat

829
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,050
and you use food as a fuel source,

830
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,890
that food can be broken down

831
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,070
and you can immediately burn the glucose

832
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,940
that's in your bloodstream,

833
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,780
or you can rely on some of
the stored fuel in your liver,

834
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,010
or you can rely on stored
fuel in the muscle,

835
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,400
so-called glycogen.

836
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,100
And there are a lot of different ways

837
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,989
that we can generate ATP.

838
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,249
So when we ask the question,

839
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,350
what's limiting for performance?

840
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,320
What is going to allow us to endure,

841
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,940
to engage in effort and
endure long bouts of effort

842
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,580
or even moderately long bouts of effort?

843
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,600
We need to ask which of those things,

844
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,659
nerve, muscle, blood, heart
and lungs is limiting?

845
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,859
Or put differently,

846
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,080
we ask, what should we be
doing with our neurons?

847
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,420
What should we be doing with our muscles?

848
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,070
What should we be doing with our blood?

849
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,230
What should we be doing with our heart

850
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,350
and what should we be doing with our lungs

851
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,969
that's going to allow
us to build endurance

852
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,019
for mental and physical work

853
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,020
and to be able to go longer,
further with more intensity?

854
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:03,990
That's the real question?

855
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,130
How can we do more work?

856
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,030
And the way we do that is with energy,

857
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,250
and the way to get energy to it,

858
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,550
is to buy those five things.

859
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,290
And so now we're going to talk about,

860
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,490
how you can actually build
different types of endurance?

861
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,810
And what that does at
the level of your blood,

862
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,540
your heart, your muscles and your neurons.

863
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,500
So we're going to skip back and
forth between protocols, tools

864
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,930
and the underlying science.

865
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,570
So rather than heavy stack
the science at the front end

866
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,270
and then just give you
all the tools at the end,

867
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,810
we're going to talk about the protocols,

868
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,250
the four kinds of endurance
and how to achieve them?

869
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,580
And we are going to talk
about the underlying science

870
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,570
as we move through that.

871
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,220
If you would like a lot
of detailed science,

872
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,230
I encourage you to check out a review

873
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,840
that we've linked in the show notes.

874
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,860
And the review is called
adaptations to endurance

875
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,160
and strength training.

876
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,560
This is a review article with
many excellent citations.

877
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,310
It's from Cold Spring Harbor
Perspectives in Medicine.

878
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,350
The Cold Spring Harbor Press

879
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,370
is an excellent scientific press.

880
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,870
Spent the last 21 years doing
summers at Cold Spring Harbor

881
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,260
teaching neuroscience,

882
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,240
but Cold Spring Harbor is
involved in all sorts of themes

883
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,280
and topics related to
neuroscience and medicine.

884
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,630
This review by Hughes L.Ellefson.

885
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,780
Ellefson that's the name.

886
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,180
Ellefson and Barr, B-A-A-R.

887
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,240
Adaptations through endurance
and strength training

888
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,090
is rich with citations.

889
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,440
It can be downloaded as a complete PDF.

890
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,880
There's no paywall and we will link to it.

891
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,020
And it gets really deep into
all the signaling cascades,

892
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,272
the genetic changes within muscle

893
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:39,280
with high intensity interval training,

894
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,860
short-term, super high intensity
training, weight training.

895
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,420
So if you're a real nerd for this stuff

896
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,045
and you want to get right
down into how PGC-1alpha,

897
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:54,040
P53 and PH20 change the
adaptation features of muscle

898
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,000
and gene regulation,

899
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,750
that is definitely the review for you.

900
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,130
If you're like most people,

901
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,810
and you're not really interested
in that level of detail,

902
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,180
no reason to pick up the review,

903
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,290
unless you just want to check out

904
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,550
some of the figures and pictures.

905
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,830
But I do want to offer that as a resource

906
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,410
it's been in addition to
discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,

907
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,100
it's been a primary
resource for the content

908
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,710
of this episode.

909
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,420
So let's talk about the
four kinds of endurance

910
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,660
and how to achieve those?

911
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,640
I do believe that everybody
should have some sort

912
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,410
of endurance practice,
regular endurance practice.

913
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,280
It's clear that it's vital for
the functioning of the body

914
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,500
and the mind.

915
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,224
And there are clear longevity benefits.

916
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:38,130
There are a lot of
reasons why that's true,

917
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:43,130
but the main one is that if we
have good energy utilization

918
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,340
in our musculature and in our blood,

919
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,800
in our vascular system and
in our oxygenating system,

920
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,230
our lungs, the so-called
cardiovascular system,

921
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,710
respiratory system and musculature.

922
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,080
The body and brain function much better.

923
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,170
There are so many papers now,
so much data to support that.

924
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,890
So I do believe everyone
should either try to maintain

925
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,600
the muscle that they have,

926
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,270
provided they've already
gone through puberty

927
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,690
and development.

928
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,790
And they should be engaged in
regular endurance exercise.

929
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,660
Now, for many people, they
think endurance exercise.

930
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,050
That means what?

931
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,400
A hour long run or I got
to get on the StairMaster

932
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,330
or I have to treadmill for
hours on end each week.

933
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,690
And it turns out that's not the case.

934
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,350
There are four kinds of endurance,

935
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,560
and you can train specifically
for any one of those,

936
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,090
and you can vary your training.

937
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,400
So let's talk about those
four kinds of endurance.

938
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,520
These are very interesting

939
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,790
and they each have very
different protocols

940
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,480
that you use in order to
build and maximize them.

941
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,440
And now you'll understand
what fuel sources they use

942
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,690
in order to build that
thing we call endurance.

943
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,490
So first of all, we
have muscular endurance.

944
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:00,490
Muscular endurance is the
ability for our muscles

945
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,250
to perform work over time,

946
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,300
and our failure to continue
to be able to perform

947
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,410
that work is going to be
due to muscular fatigue,

948
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,130
not to cardiovascular fatigue.

949
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,850
So not because we're breathing too hard

950
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,160
or we can't get enough
blood to the muscles

951
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,230
or because we quit mentally,

952
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,800
but because the muscles
themselves give out.

953
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,633
Okay?

954
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:28,220
One good example of this would be,

955
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,690
if you had to pick up a stone in the yard

956
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,410
and that stone is not
extremely heavy for you,

957
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,900
and you needed to do that
anywhere from 50 to a 100 times,

958
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,570
and you were picking it
up and putting it down

959
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,790
and picking it up and putting it down

960
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,480
and picking up and putting it down.

961
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,590
At some point, your muscles will fatigue.

962
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,770
They will fail to endure.

963
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,870
Muscular endurance is incredibly useful

964
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,798
for a variety of physical pursuits.

965
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:58,850
And we will talk about the mental pursuits

966
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,570
that it supports as well.

967
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,760
In terms of physical pursuits,

968
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,920
the ability for a given muscle
to perform repeated work

969
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,360
is going to improve your golf swing.

970
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,720
It's going to improve your tennis swing.

971
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,570
It's going to improve your posture,

972
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,840
your ability to dance,

973
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,750
your ability to repeatedly
engage in an activity

974
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,320
that requires effort in a
way that's very different

975
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,840
from the kind of endurance
that you will build simply

976
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,270
by increasing your cardiovascular fitness,

977
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,280
your ability to generate
kind of easy repetition.

978
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,980
So let's talk about muscular
endurance and what it is?

979
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,770
Muscular endurance is
going to be something

980
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:41,770
that you can perform for
anywhere from 12 to 25,

981
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,760
or even up to 100 repetitions.

982
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,740
And that's actually how if you like

983
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,760
you would train muscular endurance.

984
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,920
And I'll give the specific
protocol in a few moments.

985
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,950
So a good example is push-ups, right?

986
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,660
If you were to get on the
floor and start doing push-ups,

987
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,840
even if you're somebody who
has to do knees down push-ups,

988
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,180
and you're doing your push-ups,

989
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,570
eventually you won't be
able to do any more push-ups

990
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,320
and that's not going to be
because you couldn't get enough

991
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,140
oxygen into your system,

992
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,990
or your heart wasn't pumping enough blood.

993
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,410
It's going to be because the muscles fail.

994
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,430
That's why.

995
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,540
So if you want to be
able to do more push-ups

996
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,180
or even more pull-ups.

997
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,140
Muscular endurance is
really what it's about.

998
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,470
It's actually no coincidence
that a lot of military bootcamp

999
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,760
style training is not done with weights,

1000
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,690
it's done with things
like push-ups, pull-ups,

1001
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,030
sit-ups and running.

1002
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,240
Because what they're really
building is muscular endurance.

1003
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,570
The ability to perform
work repeatedly over time

1004
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,370
for a given set of muscles and neurons.

1005
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,570
So what's a good protocol
to build muscular endurance.

1006
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,560
Let's just give that to you now

1007
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,560
and explain some of the
underlying science as it follows.

1008
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,760
So a really good muscular
endurance training protocol

1009
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
according to the scientific
literature would be,

1010
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,760
three to five sets of anywhere
from 12 to 100 repetitions.

1011
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,170
That's a huge range.

1012
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,170
Now, 12 to 25 repetitions is
going to be more reasonable

1013
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,620
for most people.

1014
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,240
And the rest periods
are going to be anywhere

1015
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,480
from 30 to 180 seconds of rest.

1016
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,920
So anywhere from half a minute
to three minutes of rest.

1017
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,980
So this might be five sets of push-ups,

1018
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,420
done getting your maximum push-ups

1019
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,530
although for some people
that might be zero

1020
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,870
and you have to do it knees down.

1021
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,390
For some people it might be 10 push-ups,

1022
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,540
for some people might be 25,

1023
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,200
but you could go all the way up to 100.

1024
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,060
Rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds,

1025
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,500
and then do your next set

1026
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,420
for a total of three to five sets.

1027
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,730
So it doesn't actually
sound like a ton of work.

1028
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,070
The other thing you could do
is something like a plank.

1029
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,530
A plank position is actually a way

1030
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,945
to build muscular endurance, not strength.

1031
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:51,778
Okay?

1032
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,690
I'm sure it could be
used to develop strength,

1033
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,410
but it's really about muscular endurance.

1034
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,980
So you would do three
to five sets of planks.

1035
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,660
Those planks would probably even

1036
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,850
because you're not doing repetitions,

1037
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,580
it's an isometric hold as we say,

1038
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,000
as kind of static hold or a wall sit

1039
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,230
would be another example.

1040
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,100
And you would do that probably
for a minute or two minutes,

1041
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,800
take some rest of anywhere
from 30, 60, or 180 seconds,

1042
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,020
and then repeat.

1043
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,602
So things like pushing a sled, push-ups,

1044
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:21,000
isometric planks, even pull-ups,

1045
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,490
those will all work.

1046
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,980
And as with others forms of training,

1047
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,250
you would want to do this,

1048
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,450
until you approach
failure or actually fail

1049
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:34,110
and where you're unable to
perform another repetition

1050
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,740
that would mark the end of a set.

1051
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,060
The one critical feature of
building muscular endurance

1052
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,940
is that it has no major east
centric loading component.

1053
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,990
Now, I haven't talked much about eccentric

1054
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,810
and concentric loading.

1055
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,010
But concentric loading is
when you are shortening

1056
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,030
the muscle typically or lifting a weight.

1057
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,340
And east centric movements

1058
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,890
are when you are lengthening
a muscle typically

1059
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,680
or lowering a weight.

1060
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,810
So if you do a pull up and
you get your chin over the bar

1061
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,220
or a chin up, that's the
concentric portion of the effort,

1062
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,330
and then as you lower yourself,

1063
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,397
that's the eccentric portion.

1064
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:15,270
Eccentric portion of resistance
training of any kind,

1065
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:17,290
whether or not it's for
endurance or for strength

1066
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,200
is one of the major causes of soreness.

1067
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,710
Some people will be more
susceptible to this,

1068
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,160
excuse me than others,

1069
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,960
but it does create more
damage in muscle fibers.

1070
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,840
Muscular endurance and
building muscular endurance

1071
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,610
should not include any movements

1072
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,410
that include major eccentric loads.

1073
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,930
So if you're going to do push-ups,

1074
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,340
it doesn't mean that you want to drop,

1075
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,940
you know, smash your chest into the floor.

1076
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,620
And by the way your chest
should touch the ground

1077
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,010
on every push-up.

1078
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,300
That's a real push-up.

1079
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,133
Okay?

1080
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:49,700
It's not about breaking
90 with the elbows,

1081
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,220
it's about pushing down until
your chest touch the floor

1082
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,053
and straightening out.

1083
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:54,350
That's a proper push-up.

1084
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,730
And a pull-up is where you pull
up your chin above the bar.

1085
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,730
Neither of those should
include a slow eccentric

1086
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,170
or lowering component.

1087
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,050
If you are using those to
train muscular endurance

1088
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,417
the three to five sets of 12 to 25

1089
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:09,760
and maybe even up to 100 repetitions

1090
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,090
with 3,280 seconds of rest in between.

1091
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:18,790
That means that jumping also
is going to be a very poor tool

1092
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,520
for building muscular endurance,

1093
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,460
because jumping has a slowing
down component as you land.

1094
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,340
So things like plyometrics or agility work

1095
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,730
where you're moving from side to side,

1096
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,790
and you're decelerating,

1097
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,530
you're slowing yourself down a lot,

1098
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,660
not going to be good
for muscular endurance.

1099
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,040
Terrific for cardiovascular training

1100
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,130
and conditioning of other
kinds and skill training

1101
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,680
and agility and all that.

1102
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,640
But if you want to build
muscular endurance,

1103
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,960
you want to make your muscles
able to do more work for longer.

1104
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,860
It's going to be this three to five sets

1105
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,979
of 12 to 100 reps,

1106
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:56,220
30 to 180 seconds of
mainly concentric movement.

1107
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,053
Okay?

1108
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:02,000
Not a slow lowering phase
or a heavy lowering phase.

1109
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,610
So that might be kettlebell
swings and things of that sort.

1110
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,360
Isometrics, as I mentioned,
things like planks

1111
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,940
and wall sets will work.

1112
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,400
Now, what's interesting
about this is that,

1113
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,260
it doesn't seem at all
like what people normally

1114
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,600
think of as endurance.

1115
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,970
And yet it's been shown in nice, quality

1116
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,070
peer-reviewed studies,

1117
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,840
several of which are cited in the review

1118
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,230
I mentioned earlier,

1119
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:27,670
that muscular endurance
can improve our ability

1120
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,630
to engage in long bouts of
what we call long duration,

1121
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,610
low-intensity endurance work.

1122
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,620
So this can support long runs.

1123
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,260
It can support long swims.

1124
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,090
And it can build also...

1125
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,090
It can build postural strength
and endurance simultaneously

1126
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,120
and that's mainly accomplished
through isometrical.

1127
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,770
So things like planks
are actually quite good

1128
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,410
for building endurance of
the spinal erector muscles

1129
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,570
that provide posture of
the abdominal muscles

1130
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,250
that are helpful for
posture for being upright

1131
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,470
for the upper neck muscles
and things of that sort.

1132
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,520
These days everyone
seems to have texts neck.

1133
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,790
Everyone is basically staring
at their toes all the time

1134
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,610
as a default towards their toes.

1135
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,590
So isometric holds can be very good

1136
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,780
for building muscular endurance.

1137
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,890
You can spot people including yourself,

1138
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,960
perhaps with poor muscular
endurance in the postural muscles

1139
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,690
because anytime they stop moving,

1140
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,380
they have to lean against a wall

1141
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,610
or their hip will move to one side,

1142
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,330
or they're always leaned to one side.

1143
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:29,900
I am guilty of this too.

1144
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,600
Some of you have actually pointed out.

1145
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,410
I like to think out of concern

1146
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,280
that I often am rubbing my lower back.

1147
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,040
And indeed I have some
asymmetries of my postural muscles

1148
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,450
some of which are probably genetic

1149
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,322
and some of which are probably
just from excessive work

1150
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,530
or something of that sort

1151
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,010
that have my right shoulder
set lower than my left

1152
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,000
and things of that sort.

1153
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,710
If I wanted to improve those,

1154
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,180
I could improve those by
really focusing on symmetry

1155
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,200
and isometric.

1156
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,240
Symmetry meaning holding my
hands at equivalent positions

1157
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,310
in planks and doing isometric holds

1158
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:03,110
for building muscular endurance
of the postural muscles.

1159
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,750
But this can also be done with,

1160
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,800
as I mentioned, kettlebell
swings for the lower back

1161
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,550
and legs and posterior chain.

1162
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,870
So there are a number
of different exercises

1163
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:10,703
you could do this with,

1164
00:48:10,703 --> 00:48:14,240
but it should be compound
exercises mainly.

1165
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,400
It's rare for people to do
this kind of muscular endurance

1166
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,660
work specifically for things
like bicep curls or triceps.

1167
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,180
And there aren't many activities

1168
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,247
that really rely on
isolation of those muscles

1169
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:26,690
and repeatedly, right?

1170
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:27,523
It's hard...

1171
00:48:27,523 --> 00:48:28,356
I'm sure there are some out there,

1172
00:48:28,356 --> 00:48:30,220
but it's kind of hard to imagine.

1173
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,600
So you can do this with isometrics,

1174
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,900
you can do this with more standard

1175
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,180
non-isometric type movements,

1176
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,730
but make sure there isn't
a strong eccentric load.

1177
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,540
So now let's talk about
the science briefly

1178
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,490
of why this works?

1179
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,970
Well, that takes us back to
this issue of fuel utilization

1180
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:48,670
and what fails?

1181
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,680
So if we would say, okay,
let's say you do a plank

1182
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,480
and you're planking for,

1183
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,370
you know, maybe you're
able to plank for a minute

1184
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,360
or two minutes or three minutes.

1185
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,020
At some point you will fail.

1186
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,340
You're not going to fail
because the heart gives out.

1187
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,670
You're not going to fail because
you can't get enough oxygen

1188
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,580
because you can breathe
while you're doing that.

1189
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,180
You're going to fail because
of local muscular failure.

1190
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,780
Which means that as you do,

1191
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,260
if you choose to do this
protocol of three to five sets,

1192
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,750
et cetera, et cetera, to
build muscular endurance,

1193
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,760
mainly what you are going to be building

1194
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,280
is you're going to be building the ability

1195
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,450
of your mitochondria to use oxygen

1196
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,270
to generate energy locally.

1197
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,590
And that is something called
mitochondrial respiration.

1198
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,270
Respiration because of
the involvement of oxygen.

1199
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:41,180
And it's also going to
be increasing the extent

1200
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,700
to which the neurons control the muscles

1201
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,370
and provide a stimulus for
the muscles to contract.

1202
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,300
But this is independent
of power and strength.

1203
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,133
Okay?

1204
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:55,370
So even though the low sets
like three to five sets

1205
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,350
and the fact that you're doing repetitions

1206
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,100
and you're going to failure,

1207
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,077
even though it seems to
resemble power and strength

1208
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:05,020
and hypertrophy type training,
it is distinctly different.

1209
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,260
It's not going to generate
strength, hypertrophy and power.

1210
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,690
It's going to mainly create
this ability to endure

1211
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,760
to continually contract muscles

1212
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,980
or repeatedly contract muscles.

1213
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,813
Okay?

1214
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,200
Continually if you're
using isometric holds,

1215
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,220
repeatedly, excuse me,

1216
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,520
if you're using repetition type exercise

1217
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,720
where there's a contraction
and an extension the muscle

1218
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,840
essentially concentric
and an eccentric portion.

1219
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,910
But remember that you want the
eccentric portion to be light

1220
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,350
and relatively fast,

1221
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,660
not so fast that you injure yourself,

1222
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,770
but certainly not
deliberately slowed down.

1223
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:45,770
It was recommended, I
should say by Andy Galpin

1224
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,860
that you not use Olympic lifts for this,

1225
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,070
because once you get past
eight or 12 or 25 repetitions,

1226
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,240
especially form on those
Olympic lifts is key

1227
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,020
for not getting injured.

1228
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,060
And while some people can
perform those sorts of of lifts

1229
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,810
likes snatches and deadlifts
and cleans and jerks

1230
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,400
and overhead presses,

1231
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,140
probably not a great idea if
the goal is to push the body

1232
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,220
to points of fatigue,

1233
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,960
because you do open yourself up to injury,

1234
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,540
unless you're very skilled at doing that,

1235
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,610
or you have a really good coach

1236
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,930
who can help you guide
through those lifts.

1237
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,810
So that's one form of endurance

1238
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,643
which is muscular endurance.

1239
00:51:20,643 --> 00:51:24,230
And it's mainly going to
rely on neural energy.

1240
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,930
So nerves and muscle.

1241
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,950
And it's not going to rely quite so much

1242
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,640
on what's available in your
blood, your heart or your lungs.

1243
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,680
So now let's talk about the
other extreme of endurance

1244
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,320
which is long duration endurance.

1245
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,731
This is the type that
people typically think about

1246
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,010
when they think about endurance.

1247
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,630
You're talking about a
long run, a long swim,

1248
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,950
a long bike ride.

1249
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:51,960
Well, how long we'll
anywhere from 12 minutes

1250
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,060
to several hours or
maybe even an entire day,

1251
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,540
maybe eight or nine hours of
hiking or running or biking.

1252
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,770
Some people are actually doing those kinds

1253
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,710
of really long events
marathons, for instance.

1254
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,430
So anything longer than 12 minutes.

1255
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:10,430
And this type of work
builds on fuel utilization

1256
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,390
in the muscles,

1257
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,730
it builds on the activity
of neurons in the brain

1258
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,250
that are involved in what we call

1259
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,740
central pattern generators.

1260
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,150
We talked about this in a previous episode

1261
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,570
or several previous episodes.

1262
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,780
These are groups of
neurons that allow our body

1263
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,370
to engage in regular rhythmic effort

1264
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,730
without having to think
about the movement too much.

1265
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,770
So running and stepping or swimming

1266
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:32,990
if you already know how to swim,

1267
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:36,040
or peddling on a bike or
walking upstairs and hiking,

1268
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,790
you're not thinking about
right, left, right, left.

1269
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:42,140
It's all carried out by
central pattern generators.

1270
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,500
This is going to be at
less than a hundred percent

1271
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,850
of your maximum oxygen uptake,

1272
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,550
your VO2 max, I'll talk
about what VO2 max is.

1273
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,740
But I just want to give a
sense of what the protocol is,

1274
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,780
and the underlying science.

1275
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,630
How many sets?

1276
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,510
One.

1277
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:02,510
Long duration effort is one
set of 12 minutes or longer.

1278
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,180
So you're not counting repetitions.

1279
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,350
I sure hope that if you're
going out on a 30 minute run

1280
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,300
or even a 15 minute run,

1281
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,180
that you're not counting steps,

1282
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,810
that you're not counting pedal strokes,

1283
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:15,690
that you're not on the rower
counting poles on the rower.

1284
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:16,680
I suppose you could,

1285
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,830
but I think that would be pretty dreadful.

1286
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,500
Seems like a poor utilization
of cognitive brain space.

1287
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,970
You're getting into
regular repeated effort

1288
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,720
and your ability to continue that effort

1289
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,920
is going to be dependent
mainly on the efficiency

1290
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,390
of the movement on your
ability to strike a balance

1291
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,060
between the movement itself,

1292
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,790
the generation of the muscular
movements that are required,

1293
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:47,940
and fuel utilization across
the different sources

1294
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,270
of nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.

1295
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,240
So let's ask the question.

1296
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,160
Why would you fail on a long run?

1297
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,540
Why would you quit?

1298
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,140
Well, as you set out on that long run,

1299
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,900
assuming you have some
glycogen in your liver

1300
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,400
and in your muscles, you're
going to use that energy first,

1301
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,910
even if it's very low intensity.

1302
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,460
I guess we're not talking about sprinting,

1303
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,790
we're talking about heading out the door

1304
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,310
or starting off on a marathon.

1305
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,390
You're starting to assuming
you have some conditioning

1306
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:12,223
or even if you don't,

1307
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,640
you're going to burn carbohydrate.

1308
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,330
You're going to burn
glucose in the bloodstream,

1309
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,720
you're going to burn carbohydrate
as those muscles contract.

1310
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,100
Those what we call slow twitch muscles.

1311
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,933
They're contracting,

1312
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:22,150
they start burning up fuel to make ATP

1313
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,963
to continue to contract.

1314
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,430
Your mind is going to
use more or less energy

1315
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,040
depending on how much willpower,

1316
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,640
how much of a fight you have
to get into with yourself

1317
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,160
in order to generate the effort.

1318
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,740
I really want to underscore this.

1319
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,850
If you're somebody that's thinking,

1320
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:39,683
maybe I go for the run,

1321
00:54:39,683 --> 00:54:40,630
maybe I don't go for the run.

1322
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,590
I'll do it at two o'clock.

1323
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,423
Okay, 2:05.

1324
00:54:42,423 --> 00:54:43,970
No, I only want to go on the half hour

1325
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,050
or maybe on the main hour.

1326
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,510
And you're going through all that.

1327
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,343
Guess what?

1328
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:49,900
You're burning up useful energy

1329
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,650
that you could use either
for the run, for example,

1330
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,060
or for something else.

1331
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,560
When we think about something hard,

1332
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,300
when we ruminate,

1333
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,830
when we perseverate on
an idea or on a decision,

1334
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,810
we are burning neural
energy and neural energy

1335
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,020
is glucose and epinephrin
and all the things

1336
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,470
we talked about before.

1337
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,760
So willpower in part is the ability

1338
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,570
to devote resources to things

1339
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,480
and part of that is making decisions

1340
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,440
to just either do it or not do it.

1341
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,410
I'm not of the just do it mindset.

1342
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,770
I think there's a right
time and a place to train.

1343
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,200
But I also think that it is not good.

1344
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,430
In other words, it utilizes
excessive resources

1345
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,450
to churn over decisions excessively,

1346
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:39,330
and you probably burn
as much cognitive energy

1347
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,190
deciding about whether or not
to do a given training or not

1348
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,310
as you do in the actual training.

1349
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,143
Okay?

1350
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:48,010
So we'll talk more about how
this long duration effort

1351
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,740
can relate to mental performance,

1352
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,200
but the long duration
effort should be one set,

1353
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,630
12 minutes or longer.

1354
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,650
It could go for 30 minutes
or 60 minutes or an hour.

1355
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:59,100
We'll talk about programming
later in the episode.

1356
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,750
This is going to be less
than a hundred percent

1357
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,510
of your maximum oxygen uptake.

1358
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,390
Your heart rate is not going
to be through the ceiling

1359
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,920
or maxed out.

1360
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,610
But it's all about efficiency of movement.

1361
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,030
That's what you're building.

1362
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,950
When you go out for a
run that's 30 minutes,

1363
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,950
you are building the capacity
to repeat that performance.

1364
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,920
The next time, while being more efficient

1365
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,420
actually burning less fuel.

1366
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,770
And that might seem a
little bit counterintuitive,

1367
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:28,390
but every time you do that run,

1368
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,270
what you're doing is you're building up

1369
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,130
mitochondrial density.

1370
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,550
It's not so much about
mitochondrial oxidation

1371
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:36,930
and respiration.

1372
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,270
You're building up mitochondrial density.

1373
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,960
You're actually increasing
the amount of ATP

1374
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,180
that you can create for
a given about of effort.

1375
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,500
You're becoming more efficient.

1376
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,333
Okay?

1377
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:51,990
You're burning less fuel
overall doing the same thing.

1378
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,140
That's really what
these long slow distance

1379
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,610
or long bouts of effort
are really all about.

1380
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,670
Now, why do this long duration effort?

1381
00:56:58,670 --> 00:56:59,860
Why would you want to do it?

1382
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,870
Why is it good for you?

1383
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,530
Well, it does something very important

1384
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,470
which is that it builds the
capillary beds within muscles.

1385
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,330
So let's talk a little
bit about vasculature.

1386
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,100
We haven't done this too much yet,

1387
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,580
but if you have seen the episode

1388
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,940
on supercharging performance.

1389
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,620
We talked about these AVAs
arteriovenous anastomosis

1390
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:26,620
where blood moves from
arteries directly into veins,

1391
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,700
but that's unusual,

1392
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,700
that only takes place in
the so-called glabrous skin

1393
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,560
of the palms, the face and
the bottoms of the feet.

1394
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,610
Typically, for most all
other areas of the body

1395
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,210
what happens is,

1396
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:46,450
arteries bring blood to a
given tissue like a muscle,

1397
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,770
and veins return that
blood back to the heart.

1398
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,560
There are exceptions, but in general.

1399
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,100
And in between arteries and
veins are these little tiny

1400
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,760
what are called capillary
beds or microcapillaries.

1401
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,650
So these are tiny little avenues,

1402
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,940
like little tiny streams and estuaries

1403
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,490
between the bigger arteries and veins.

1404
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:10,160
Now, those are actually
contained within muscle.

1405
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,640
And what's amazing is
that you can increase

1406
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,760
the number of them.

1407
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,700
You can literally build new capillaries.

1408
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,600
You can create new little
streams within your muscles

1409
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,880
and the type of long duration effort

1410
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,240
that I was talking about
before to 12 minutes or more

1411
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,200
of steady effort is very
useful for doing that,

1412
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,760
and is very useful for
increasing the mitochondria,

1413
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,760
the energy producing
elements of the cells,

1414
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,910
the actual muscle cells.

1415
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:42,910
And the reason is when
blood arrives to muscles

1416
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,560
it has oxygen.

1417
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,610
The muscles are going to
use some of that oxygen.

1418
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,540
And then some of the deoxygenated blood

1419
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,940
is going to be sent back to
the heart and to the lungs.

1420
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,990
Now, the more capillaries that
you build into those muscles,

1421
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,850
the more oxygen available
to those muscles.

1422
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,990
I don't want to get too much
into the physics of fluid flow.

1423
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,800
But basically it's the
difference between taking a hose

1424
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,630
and sticking it into some
dirt just directly like

1425
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,550
and turning on the faucet at a given rate,

1426
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,100
the spigot rather,

1427
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,080
or having a bunch of little hoses

1428
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,650
like a sprinkler system that go out

1429
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,290
and irrigate the whole yard.

1430
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:22,650
The irrigation is equivalent
to this capillary bed system.

1431
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:27,460
And it's very good at using
energy sources within blood.

1432
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,840
So the simple way to think about this is,

1433
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,110
when you go out for a run,

1434
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,810
let's say it's the first
run you've done for a while,

1435
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,680
and you out for 12 or 15 minutes

1436
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,327
and somewhere right around 20 minutes

1437
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:37,460
you're like, that's it.

1438
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,990
I just can't continue.

1439
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,180
Well, when you come back the
next time to do that run,

1440
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,030
you've built endurance largely

1441
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:48,280
because you've built these capillary beds.

1442
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,300
You've expanded these little streams

1443
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,970
in which blood can deliver
oxygen to the muscles.

1444
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,730
And so it's going to feel
relatively straightforward

1445
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,810
to either go a little bit
quicker for the same duration,

1446
00:59:58,810 --> 00:59:59,990
the same distance.

1447
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,250
Or to extend that run for
another five to 10 minutes.

1448
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,170
So this long duration work,

1449
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,330
unlike muscular endurance like planks

1450
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,620
and everything that we
were talking about before

1451
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,360
is really about building
the capillary systems

1452
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,750
and the mitochondria,

1453
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,690
the energy utilization systems

1454
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,110
within the muscles themselves.

1455
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,220
And that's very important to understand.

1456
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,150
It's distinctly different
than say building the neurons

1457
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,260
that fire the muscles.

1458
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,520
The neurons are already there,

1459
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,440
they're going to fire
those muscles just fine.

1460
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,390
In fact, if your life depended on it,

1461
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,380
today you could probably run a marathon.

1462
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,430
You'd probably get injured,

1463
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,600
it would be very psychologically
and physically painful.

1464
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,990
I don't recommend you do that
unless you're trained for it.

1465
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:39,940
But if you were to train properly for it,

1466
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,680
if you were to do long
duration bouts of effort

1467
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,010
once or twice a week or three times a week

1468
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,460
pretty soon it would become easy,

1469
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,130
because you're building
these vascular micro beds

1470
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,620
or microvascular beds as they're called.

1471
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,453
Okay?

1472
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:54,700
So you're able to bring
more energy to the muscles

1473
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,980
and they're able to utilize more energy.

1474
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,630
So that's long duration.

1475
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,700
So we've got muscular endurance

1476
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,430
and we've got long duration endurance.

1477
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:04,380
And then there are two kinds in between

1478
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,500
that in recent years have
gotten a lot of attention

1479
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,610
and excitement,

1480
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,280
but most people are not distinguishing

1481
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,500
between these two kinds of endurance.

1482
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,060
And that's a shame because
in failing to distinguish

1483
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,540
between the two kinds of what we call

1484
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,270
high-intensity training,

1485
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,300
sometimes called high
intensity interval training.

1486
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,380
Most people, perhaps you,

1487
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,960
are not getting nearly as much physical

1488
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,140
and mental benefit out of
high intensity training

1489
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,130
as you could.

1490
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,730
So I want to talk about the two kinds

1491
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,060
of high-intensity interval training,

1492
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,880
and what each of them does
for your brain and body,

1493
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,570
and what sorts of adaptations they cause?

1494
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,990
Because in doing that,

1495
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,830
you can really start to build
up specific energy systems

1496
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,970
in your brain and body in
ways that are best serve you

1497
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,580
for your cognitive work.

1498
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,900
And for other sorts of things
like strength and speed

1499
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,630
or hypertrophy or for running
marathons for that matter.

1500
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,394
So there are two kinds of
high intensity training

1501
01:02:02,394 --> 01:02:03,630
for endurance.

1502
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,233
Sometimes called high-intensity
interval training.

1503
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,410
One, is anaerobic, so-called
an aerobic endurance,

1504
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:12,520
so no oxygen.

1505
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,640
And the other is aerobic endurance.

1506
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,890
Both of which qualify as HIIT,

1507
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,150
high intensity interval training.

1508
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,793
So let's talk about
anaerobic endurance first.

1509
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:26,630
Anaerobic endurance from
a protocol perspective

1510
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:31,088
is going to be three to 12 sets.

1511
01:02:31,088 --> 01:02:32,320
Okay?

1512
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,765
And these records and I'll talk about

1513
01:02:34,765 --> 01:02:37,160
what the repetitions are,

1514
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:41,050
are going to be performed
at whatever speed allows you

1515
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,440
to complete the work in good, safe form.

1516
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,273
Okay?

1517
01:02:45,273 --> 01:02:46,550
So it could be fast, it could be slow

1518
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,530
as the work continues,

1519
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,470
your repetitions may slow down,

1520
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,810
or it may speed up.

1521
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,010
Chances are it's going to slow down.

1522
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,790
So what does this work?

1523
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,210
What are the sets look like?

1524
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,060
Remember long slow distance is one set.

1525
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,050
Muscular endurance is three to five sets.

1526
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,140
High-intensity anaerobic endurance

1527
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,290
is going to be somewhere
between three and 12 sets.

1528
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:11,580
And it's going to have
a ratio of work to rest

1529
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:15,910
of anywhere from three
to one to one to five.

1530
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:16,743
Okay?

1531
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:20,900
So what would a three to
one ratio set look like?

1532
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,190
Well, it's going to be 30
seconds of hard pedaling

1533
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:28,690
on the bike, for instance,
or running or on the rower.

1534
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:29,830
These are just examples.

1535
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,260
It could be in the pool, swimming.

1536
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,350
It could be any number
of things or air squats,

1537
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:38,350
or weighted squats if you will
provided you can manage that.

1538
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,450
30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.

1539
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,210
That's a very brief rest.

1540
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,000
So three to one is just a good example

1541
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,453
would be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.

1542
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,490
The opposite extreme on
that ratio be one to five.

1543
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:55,360
So 20 seconds on a hundred seconds off.

1544
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,490
So you do the work for 20 seconds

1545
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:59,280
then you rest a hundred seconds.

1546
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,430
Now, what's the difference?

1547
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:03,660
What should you do three one ratio?

1548
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,000
So 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,

1549
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,040
or should you do one to five,

1550
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,280
20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?

1551
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,100
Well, that will depend on
whether or not the quality

1552
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,720
of the movement is important to you.

1553
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,280
So let's just take a look
at the three to one ratio.

1554
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,550
So in the three to one ratio,

1555
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:24,710
if you're going to do 30
seconds of hard peddling

1556
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,220
on a bike followed by 10 seconds.

1557
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,630
So maybe one of these what
they call assault bikes,

1558
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,110
and then you stop for 10
seconds and then repeat,

1559
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,440
chances are you will
be able to do one, two,

1560
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,190
three, four, maybe even
as many as 12 sets,

1561
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:41,280
if you're really in good condition

1562
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,480
that you'll be able to do all those

1563
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,310
because pedaling on the bike
doesn't require a ton of skill.

1564
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,950
And if you do it incorrectly,

1565
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,830
if your elbow flares out
a little bit or something,

1566
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:51,550
it's very unlikely that you'll get injured

1567
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,440
unless it's really extreme.

1568
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,273
Okay?

1569
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:57,230
But the same movement done for
instance, with kettlebells.

1570
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,393
So 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.

1571
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,210
The first set will
probably be in good form.

1572
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:03,960
The second one will be
in pretty good form,

1573
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,680
but let's say you're getting
to the fifth and sixth set

1574
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,770
and you're going 30
seconds on 10 seconds off

1575
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,610
chances are the quality
of your repetitions

1576
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,930
will degrade significantly.

1577
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:13,260
And you increase the probability

1578
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,050
that you're going to get injured,

1579
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,070
or that you're going
to damage in some way,

1580
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,100
or that you can't complete the movement

1581
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,350
or that some smaller muscles
like your grip muscles

1582
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,760
might give out.

1583
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,593
Okay?

1584
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:28,430
So the quality of repetitions
is going to drop considerably

1585
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:30,745
with the three to one approach.

1586
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:32,630
If you're just doing it for effort.

1587
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,670
And we'll talk about what
this builds in your system

1588
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,270
in a moment, that's fine.

1589
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:41,270
But for most people, if
quality of form is important,

1590
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,430
so maybe this is using weights,

1591
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,700
maybe you're doing squats.

1592
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,570
You're going to do 20 seconds
on and 100 seconds of rest.

1593
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:49,320
Maybe it's even a barbell loaded squat,

1594
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,850
maybe you're doing kettlebells,

1595
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,960
maybe you've got some
other resistance there

1596
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,720
that's allowing you to do this.

1597
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,630
What you'll find is that the longer rest,

1598
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,320
even though it's 20
seconds of intense effort,

1599
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,470
followed by a longer rest
of about a hundred seconds

1600
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:05,580
will allow you to perform
more quality repetitions

1601
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,810
safely over time.

1602
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:12,727
So what does building
anaerobic endurance look like?

1603
01:06:12,727 --> 01:06:15,400
And then I'll tell you what
it's actually good for,

1604
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,710
in the true practical sense.

1605
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:22,440
What anaerobic endurance
exercise generally looks like

1606
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,150
is that if you decide to
do this for the first week,

1607
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,140
you might do this two
or three times a week,

1608
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,630
maybe even just once a week,

1609
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:29,910
depending on the other
things you're doing,

1610
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,850
we'll talk about programming at the end.

1611
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,110
And you would generate just three sets.

1612
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:37,520
So it might be three sets of
20 seconds of hard effort,

1613
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,410
followed by 100 seconds rest.

1614
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,000
Then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,

1615
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,967
100 seconds rest, 20 seconds
of effort, 100 seconds rest,

1616
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,290
and you might do that twice a week.

1617
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:50,800
And then each week you're
adding one or two sets, okay?

1618
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,320
In doing that, you will
build up what we call

1619
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,820
anaerobic endurance.

1620
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,830
What is anaerobic endurance?

1621
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:59,370
Well, let's ask why we fail?

1622
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:03,930
Anaerobic endurance is going
to be taking your system

1623
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:08,470
into greater than 100% of your VO2 max.

1624
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,380
It's going to be taking
your heart rate up very high

1625
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:17,370
and it's going to maximize your
oxygen utilization systems.

1626
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:20,300
That is going to have effects

1627
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,880
that are going to lead
to fatigue at some point

1628
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,713
in the workout.

1629
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:27,240
And that fatigue will
trigger an adaptation.

1630
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,350
So let's ask what
adaptation it's triggering.

1631
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:35,120
Well, it's triggering both
mitochondrial respiration,

1632
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,240
the ability of your mitochondria
to generate more energy

1633
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,840
by using more oxygen because
you're bringing so...

1634
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,900
You're maxing out,

1635
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,230
literally you're getting
above your VO2 max.

1636
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:46,690
You're hitting that
threshold of how much oxygen

1637
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,050
you can use in your system?

1638
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,720
One of the adaptations will
be that your mitochondria

1639
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,370
will shift such that
they can use more oxygen.

1640
01:07:55,370 --> 01:08:00,080
And you're going to also
increase the capillary beds,

1641
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,930
but not as much as you're going to be able

1642
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:07,630
to increase the amount of
neuron engagement of muscle.

1643
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:10,020
So normally when we start to hit fatigue,

1644
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,210
when we're exhausted,

1645
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,790
when we're breathing really hard

1646
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,410
because the systems of the body are linked

1647
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,500
and we there's a
component to this as well,

1648
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,840
a kind of motivational component.

1649
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,740
After that third or
fourth or sixth set of,

1650
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,620
you know, 20 seconds on
a hundred seconds off,

1651
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,560
or if you're at the other
extreme 30 seconds on,

1652
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,830
and 10 seconds off.

1653
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,859
There's going to be a
component of you want to stop.

1654
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:32,959
And by pushing through and
repeating another set safely,

1655
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,069
of course.

1656
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:37,459
What you're doing is
you're training the neurons

1657
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,149
to be able to access
more energy, literally,

1658
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,429
convert that into ATP and for the muscles

1659
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,960
therefore to access more energy and ATP.

1660
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,520
And the adaptation is in
the mitochondria's ability

1661
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,950
to use oxygen,

1662
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,520
and this has tremendous carry over effects

1663
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,750
for other types of exercise.

1664
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,020
So while I know and appreciate

1665
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,130
that people are using high
intensity interval training

1666
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:04,700
of this kind or similar in
order to just like burn fat,

1667
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,600
you know, do their
workouts, quote unquote.

1668
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,840
It's very useful for
building a capacity to engage

1669
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:16,220
in short bouts of effort
repeatedly to really lock in.

1670
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,479
I don't want to use the word focus

1671
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:19,009
because it's not strictly mental focus,

1672
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:24,010
but to be able to generate
short bouts of very intense work

1673
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:26,829
this can be beneficial
in competitive sports

1674
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,880
or team sports where there's
a sprinting component,

1675
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,479
where the field opens up
and you need to dribble

1676
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,029
the ball down the field, for
instance and shoot on goal.

1677
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:34,449
Or where you're playing tennis,

1678
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,680
and it's a long rally.

1679
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,600
And then all of a sudden,
somebody really starts,

1680
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,220
you know, putting you back on your heels

1681
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,910
and you have to really make
the maximum amount of effort

1682
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:45,439
to run to the net and to
get the ball across in that.

1683
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,129
Things of that sort.

1684
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:48,240
Okay?

1685
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,330
There are a variety of places
where there's carry over

1686
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,710
from this type of training,

1687
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,770
but it does support endurance.

1688
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,170
It's about muscle endurance.

1689
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,850
It's about these muscles ability
to generate a lot of force

1690
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,010
in the short-term, but repeatedly.

1691
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:01,843
Okay?

1692
01:10:01,843 --> 01:10:03,060
So that's the way to conceptualize this.

1693
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,560
And it is different than maximum power.

1694
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,680
Even though it feels like maximum effort,

1695
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,900
it is not the same as building
power and speed into muscles.

1696
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,270
Those are distinctly different protocols.

1697
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,450
So the key elements again

1698
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:18,320
are that you're bringing your breathing

1699
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,300
and your oxygen utilization
way up above your max.

1700
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,500
It's not quite hitting failure,

1701
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,720
but you're really pushing the system

1702
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,800
to the point where you are
not ready to do another set

1703
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,320
and yet you begin another set.

1704
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,840
You're not necessarily
psychologically ready.

1705
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,660
I'll talk more about
some of the adaptations

1706
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,030
that this causes in terms of
stroke volume in a few minutes

1707
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,190
when we talk about how it
is that work of this sort

1708
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:45,770
can increase our heart's ability
to deliver blood and oxygen

1709
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,210
to our lungs and other tissues.

1710
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,090
I'm going to get very
specific about how to breathe

1711
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:51,910
during these different types of protocols

1712
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:53,410
and what's happening at
the level of the heart?

1713
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:55,870
But I want to make sure I
touch on the fourth protocol

1714
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:59,140
which is high intensity
aerobic conditioning.

1715
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:02,200
So HIIT has these two forms,
anaerobic and aerobic.

1716
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,920
And you just heard about anaerobic.

1717
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,410
High-intensity aerobic conditioning

1718
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:10,133
also involves about three to 12 sets.

1719
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,620
Starting off of course, with fewer sets

1720
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,800
as you're getting into this training

1721
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,090
and then extending into more sets

1722
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,470
as one parameter you could expand.

1723
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:22,430
Has again the same ratio of three to one.

1724
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,990
So 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,

1725
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,770
or one to five, 20 seconds
on 100 seconds off,

1726
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:30,110
or a very powerful tool for
building up aerobic conditioning

1727
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:32,850
is a one-to-one ratio.

1728
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:37,850
A one-to-one ratio is powerful
for building on average.

1729
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:42,050
Most of the energy systems involving,

1730
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:46,223
remember we had these nerve
muscle blood, heart and lungs.

1731
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:50,820
A one-to-one ratio
might be you run a mile.

1732
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,140
And however long that takes,

1733
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,280
let's say it takes you six
minutes or seven minutes,

1734
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,693
then you rest for an
equivalent amount of time.

1735
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,793
Then you repeat.

1736
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,430
And then you rest for an
equivalent amount of time.

1737
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:04,380
So you might run first mile
is let's say seven minutes.

1738
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,470
Then you rest for seven minutes.

1739
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:06,510
Then you run a mile again,

1740
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,167
and it might take eight minutes

1741
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:09,390
and you rest for eight minutes.

1742
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,623
And you continue that for a
total of four miles of work.

1743
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:16,470
Four miles of running work, I should say.

1744
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,920
Or seven miles of work.

1745
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,060
You can build this up.

1746
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:22,570
Many people find that
using this type of training

1747
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:26,140
allows them to do things
like go run half marathons

1748
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,600
and marathons even though
prior to the race date,

1749
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,750
they've never actually run
a half marathon or marathon.

1750
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,790
Now, that might seem incredible.

1751
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:37,680
It's like how could it be
that running a mile on,

1752
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,660
and then resting for running a mile

1753
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,540
and then resting for an
equivalent amount of time,

1754
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,660
running a mile, resting
for equivalent amount time

1755
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,930
for seven miles allows
you to run continuously

1756
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:50,460
for 13 miles or for 26 miles.

1757
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,230
Well, I'm not discouraging people

1758
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:54,700
from ever doing the
long duration endurance.

1759
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,450
I think that is very important.

1760
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:00,630
But it's because it builds
up so many of these energy

1761
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:01,810
utilization systems.

1762
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,650
It really teaches you
to engage, excuse me,

1763
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:06,810
the nerve to muscle firing.

1764
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:11,810
It improves ATP and
mitochondrial function in muscle.

1765
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:15,410
It allows the blood to deliver more oxygen

1766
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,940
to the muscle and to your brain.

1767
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,870
And I'll explain how that is.

1768
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:24,450
And it allows your heart to
deliver more oxygen overall.

1769
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,660
And it builds a tremendous lung capacity.

1770
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,560
And we will talk about
exactly how to breathe

1771
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,440
and how to build lung capacity.

1772
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,730
Both for sake of warming
up and for performance.

1773
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,770
So what would this look like?

1774
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:35,960
And when should you do this?

1775
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,560
Well, it's really a
question for these workouts

1776
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:43,440
of asking how much work can
one do in eight to 12 minutes,

1777
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,273
right?

1778
01:13:44,273 --> 01:13:45,600
And then rest, and then repeat.

1779
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,290
How much work can you do
for eight to 12 minutes

1780
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,240
then rest and then repeat?

1781
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,160
And how many times should you do this?

1782
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,910
Well, this is the sort of
thing it's pretty intense.

1783
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:56,100
And so you would probably
only want to do this two,

1784
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,270
maybe three times a week

1785
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,810
if you're not doing many other things.

1786
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,390
I will talk about how this program

1787
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,670
can be moved in with
other forms of training.

1788
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,510
But I'll just give you a little hint now.

1789
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:09,310
It's very clear and it's
described in the review article

1790
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:12,330
are referred to and we will
link another article as well.

1791
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:14,827
That concurrent training,
doing strength training

1792
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:17,320
and the endurance training
of any of the four kinds

1793
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,770
that I'm describing today can be done.

1794
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,730
You can program those in the same week.

1795
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:24,980
But you want to get four and ideally six

1796
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:28,290
or even better 24 hours
between these workouts.

1797
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,750
Because it is very hard, for instance,

1798
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,420
to do a one-to-one mile repeats

1799
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,107
like run a mile rest for equivalent time,

1800
01:14:35,107 --> 01:14:36,870
run a mile rest for equivalent time

1801
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,600
to do that two or three times a week,

1802
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,440
and also do weight training before

1803
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,380
or do a long run afterwards.

1804
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:45,110
That would quickly lead to
break down for most people,

1805
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:48,990
unless you have very, very good
energy utilization systems.

1806
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:52,100
You're really kind of
advanced or elite athlete,

1807
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:55,510
and or dare I say you're using tools

1808
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:57,710
to enhance your performance
at the level of blood

1809
01:14:57,710 --> 01:14:58,543
or hormones.

1810
01:14:58,543 --> 01:15:00,150
And I'm actually going to
talk about those at the end

1811
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,600
and why they work?

1812
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,320
So we have four kinds of endurance.

1813
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,380
Muscular endurance.

1814
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,970
We have long-duration endurance.

1815
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:08,140
We have high intensity
interval training of two kinds,

1816
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,830
anaerobic and aerobic.

1817
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:13,350
And this last type, the
aerobic one works best.

1818
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,550
It seems if you kind of
do this one-to-one ratio.

1819
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,350
So how would you use these and
what are they actually doing?

1820
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:21,880
Let's talk about the heart
and the lungs and oxygen,

1821
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,540
because that's something
that we can all benefit

1822
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,930
from understanding.

1823
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,670
And it will become very
clear in that discussion

1824
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:31,300
why this type of training is very useful

1825
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,830
even for non-athletes in
order to improve oxygenation

1826
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:38,530
and energy utilization of
the brain and the heart.

1827
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:40,110
The brain and the heart are probably

1828
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,470
the two most important systems

1829
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,340
that you need to take
care of in your life.

1830
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,170
Yes, your musculature
needs to be maintained.

1831
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:47,970
If you want to build it, that's up to you.

1832
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,070
But you should try and
maintain your musculature,

1833
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,070
but maintaining or
enhancing a brain function

1834
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,790
and cardiovascular function.

1835
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,785
It's absolutely clear are
key for health and longevity

1836
01:15:57,785 --> 01:15:59,300
in the short and long-term.

1837
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,210
And the sorts of training
I talked about today

1838
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:03,210
has been shown again and again and again

1839
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:07,680
to be very useful for enhancing
the strength of the mind.

1840
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,270
Yes, I'll talk about that.

1841
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:12,580
As well as the health of
the brain and the body.

1842
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,520
So let's talk about the
sorts of adaptations

1843
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,130
that are happening in your brain and body

1844
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:19,980
that are so beneficial in these
different forms of training.

1845
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:23,150
If you are breathing hard and
your heart is beating hard.

1846
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:26,670
So this would be certainly
in the high intensity

1847
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,690
anaerobic and aerobic conditioning.

1848
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:30,860
'Cause you're getting up near your VO2 max

1849
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,980
in high intensity aerobic conditioning,

1850
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:36,130
and you're exceeding your
VO2 max in high intensity

1851
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,720
anaerobic conditioning.

1852
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,560
What's going to happen is as of course,

1853
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,360
your heart beats faster,

1854
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,183
your blood is going to be
circulating faster in principle.

1855
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:50,280
Oxygen utilization in
muscles is going to go up

1856
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,140
and over time, not long,

1857
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,540
very quickly what will happen

1858
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,860
when those capillary beds start to expand?

1859
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:58,913
We talked about that.

1860
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:05,340
But in addition, because
of the amount of blood

1861
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,250
that's being returned to the heart,

1862
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,640
when you engage in these
really intense bouts

1863
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,360
of effort repeatedly,

1864
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,890
the amount of blood being
returned to the heart

1865
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:18,180
actually causes an east centric loading

1866
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:21,530
of one of the muscular walls of the heart.

1867
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,680
So your heart is muscle.

1868
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,910
It's cardiac muscle.

1869
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,440
We have skeletal muscle
attached to our bones

1870
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,390
and we have cardiac
muscle, which is our heart.

1871
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:31,140
When more blood is being
returned to the heart

1872
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,630
because of the additional
work that your muscles

1873
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:35,873
and nerves are doing,

1874
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,490
it actually has the effect of creating

1875
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:44,490
an east centric loading, a
kind of pushing of the wall,

1876
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,010
the left wall.

1877
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:48,040
I realize I'm not using
the strict anatomy here,

1878
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,010
but I don't want to get
into all the features

1879
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,580
of the structural features of the heart.

1880
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:57,580
But the left ventricle
essentially getting slammed back

1881
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:00,580
and then having to push back

1882
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:03,240
in a kind of east centric
loading of the cardiac muscle

1883
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,193
and the muscle thickens,

1884
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:09,060
but not because the
heart thickens overall,

1885
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,010
it's actually a strengthening
of the cardiac muscle

1886
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:15,130
in a way that increases
what we call stroke volume.

1887
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:18,040
Meaning as more blood is
returned to the heart.

1888
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,050
There's an adaptation
where the heart muscle

1889
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:24,570
actually gets stronger and
therefore can pump more blood

1890
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,400
per stroke per beat.

1891
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,890
And as it does that, it delivers

1892
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:34,130
because blood contains glucose
and oxygen and other things.

1893
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,400
It delivers more fuel to your muscles

1894
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,160
which allows you to do yet
more work per unit time.

1895
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:40,993
Okay?

1896
01:18:40,993 --> 01:18:43,040
So when we hear that,
oh, you know, so-and-so

1897
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,810
has a or maybe you have
a nice low heart rate

1898
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:49,010
that maybe you're one of
these really extreme folks

1899
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:50,640
like 30 or 40 beats per minute,

1900
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,140
although most people are
sitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,

1901
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,720
that's your resting heart rate.

1902
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,210
If you exercise regularly

1903
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:59,040
and you do long duration aerobic work,

1904
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,820
your heart rate will start to go down,

1905
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,890
your resting heart rate.

1906
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:05,410
It will increase the stroke
volume of your heart.

1907
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:07,600
If you do this high
intensity type training

1908
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,370
where your heart is beating very hard.

1909
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,800
So maybe the one-to-one
ratio mile run repeats

1910
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,080
that I described a minute ago.

1911
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,270
Let's say you do that twice
a week for three or four.

1912
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:20,130
And I said, it could go all
the way up to 12 rep sets,

1913
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:20,963
which is a lot.

1914
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:22,560
I don't recommend people start there.

1915
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,220
Pretty soon, the stroke
volume of your heart

1916
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:26,340
will really increase.

1917
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,900
And as a consequence,
you can deliver more fuel

1918
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,490
to your muscles and to your brain,

1919
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:35,490
and you will notice that
you can do more work

1920
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:37,640
meaning you can do the same
work you were doing a few days

1921
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,230
or weeks ago with relative ease.

1922
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,930
Your cognitive functioning will improve.

1923
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:44,820
This has been shown again and again,

1924
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,000
because there's an
increase in vasculature.

1925
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,870
Literally, capillary
beds within the brain,

1926
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:51,540
the hippocampus areas that support memory,

1927
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:54,700
but also areas of the brain
that support respiration,

1928
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,890
that support focus,

1929
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:57,360
that support effort.

1930
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,660
This isn't often discussed,

1931
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,830
but the ability to deliver more blood

1932
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,310
and therefore more glucose,

1933
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:05,700
remember neurons run on
glucose and oxygen to the brain

1934
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,810
is a big feature of why
exercise of the kind

1935
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:11,840
of describing helps with brain function.

1936
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,670
Now, weight training does
have some positive effects

1937
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:16,990
on brain function also.

1938
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,980
When I say weight training, I'm really...

1939
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,200
I should be more specific.

1940
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,460
I really am referring to strength
and hypertrophy training.

1941
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,640
Strength and hypertrophy training

1942
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,420
especially if it's of the sort
where you get into the burn

1943
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,700
as we talked about last episode

1944
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,130
and you start generating
lactate as a hormonal signal

1945
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:34,010
that can benefit your brain, et cetera.

1946
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:36,690
It can have positive effects on the brain.

1947
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:38,930
And frankly, there haven't
been as many studies

1948
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:40,577
of resistance training strength

1949
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:43,060
and hypertrophy training
on brain function,

1950
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,130
mainly because most of those experiments

1951
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:48,670
are done in mice or
primates, non-human primates,

1952
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:49,503
I should say.

1953
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:53,060
And it's hard to get mice
to do resistance training.

1954
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:53,893
Okay?

1955
01:20:53,893 --> 01:20:55,250
It's hard to get humans
to do resistance training.

1956
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,140
It's definitely hard to get
mice to do resistance training.

1957
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:58,160
There are ways to do it,

1958
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,630
but it's hard to get
them to do say, you know,

1959
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,580
three sets of eight on the
deadlift and then do some curls

1960
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,500
and then do some chin-ups
and this kind of thing.

1961
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,453
Okay?

1962
01:21:06,453 --> 01:21:08,550
It's pretty easy to get a
mouse to run on a treadmill

1963
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:10,980
and you can set the
tension on that treadmill

1964
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,780
to make it so that it's
easier or harder for the mouse

1965
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:15,540
to turn that wheel.

1966
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,470
So that's one of the reasons.

1967
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,570
However, it's very clear

1968
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,580
and you should now understand intuitively

1969
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:24,550
why the kind of standard
strength and hypertrophy

1970
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:28,020
type workouts are not going to activate

1971
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,700
the blood oxygenation and
the stroke volume increases

1972
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,710
for the heart that the sorts of training

1973
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,410
I'm talking about today will.

1974
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:38,730
It just doesn't have the
same positive effects.

1975
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,080
Now, that isn't to say that
if you just weight train

1976
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,000
that you'll be dumb or that
you'll lose your memory

1977
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,370
over time, you might,

1978
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:48,600
but it is to say that endurance work

1979
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,630
in particular the high intensity

1980
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:53,120
and long duration work that
I've talked about today.

1981
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,480
The two high intensity protocols

1982
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,950
and the long duration work has been shown

1983
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,550
again and again and again,

1984
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:00,810
to have positive effects
on brain function.

1985
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,580
Not through the addition of new neurons,

1986
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,060
sorry to break it to you,

1987
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:07,180
but that's not a major
event in the exercised

1988
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:10,130
or non-exercised human brain,

1989
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,640
for reasons we can talk
about in a future episode.

1990
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,080
But it still has many positive effects

1991
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,850
through the delivery of things like IGF-1,

1992
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,710
but also just through plain
oxygenation of the brain

1993
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:25,740
and the way it promotes the
development of microvasculature

1994
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,210
to develop, to excuse me,

1995
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:30,050
to deliver new neurons more nutrients.

1996
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:33,490
If neurons don't get oxygen
and glucose, they do die.

1997
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,220
Unless there's another
fuel source like ketones

1998
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,720
which can replace the glucose.

1999
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,310
If you don't give oxygen to neurons,

2000
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,240
if you don't deliver enough to them,

2001
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,550
you get what's called ischemia,

2002
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,010
you get little micro strokes.

2003
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:48,930
So the type of exercise
I'm talking about today

2004
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,040
in generating intense heart rate increases

2005
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,040
provided that safe for you to do.

2006
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,030
Breathing hard,

2007
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:56,700
that's going to deliver oxygen in blood,

2008
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,310
increase stroke volume of the heart

2009
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,980
and is going to improve brain function

2010
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,930
has been supported by many, many quality

2011
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,600
peer-reviewed studies.

2012
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,850
So that's one form of positive adaptation.

2013
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,180
I also talked about just sort
of performance adaptations.

2014
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:13,700
How doing high intensity
aerobic conditioning

2015
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:17,040
of the mile repeats type
training can actually

2016
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,840
improve your ability to do
long bouts of intense work.

2017
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,490
It also seems like it dovetails

2018
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,070
or is compatible with resistance training

2019
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:28,440
that's aimed towards
strength and hypertrophy.

2020
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,360
Now, in full disclosure
the data seemed to indicate

2021
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,980
that if people just weight
train or train for strength,

2022
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,040
so three reps, rest five minutes,

2023
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,580
three reps of heavyweights, et cetera.

2024
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,990
Yeah, you'll get much
stronger than you would

2025
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:44,650
if you're doing things like
five repetitions up to 12,

2026
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,380
or 12 to 25 reps and you're
going out for long jogs.

2027
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,890
There's always going to be
a compromise in adaptations,

2028
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:51,940
unfortunately

2029
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,970
It does seem like you can
do concurrent training

2030
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,810
as I mentioned before,
if you allow anywhere

2031
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:59,640
from four to six or ideally
24 hours between workouts.

2032
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,240
As I mentioned in the previous episode,

2033
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,350
if you want to know if you
are recovered from a workout?

2034
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,930
A great way to do that is to apply

2035
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:08,080
the carbon dioxide tolerance test,

2036
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,660
which is four breaths in and out,

2037
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,010
inhale, exhale, inhale exhale,

2038
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:12,420
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

2039
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:16,040
then a big inhale and then
a slow controlled exhale.

2040
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:20,440
If that slow controlled exhale
is 60 seconds or longer,

2041
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,120
it means that your parasympathetic,

2042
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,730
your calming nervous system
is under your control.

2043
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,600
And it's likely, I should say likely

2044
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,360
that systemically your whole
nervous system has recovered

2045
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,820
from whatever it is that you've been doing

2046
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,480
and experiencing in life
including work in relationships.

2047
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:37,780
If not, you might want to
take a rest day, dare I say.

2048
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,350
Or Costello's on is what?

2049
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:41,270
He's 10 now.

2050
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:44,660
I think he's on his 12,000 thrust day.

2051
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,800
Most people need I should say,

2052
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,000
one to two full rest days per week.

2053
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,990
I know there are people going to say

2054
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,420
that's ridiculous and okay,

2055
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,000
maybe you have amazing recovery abilities,

2056
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,500
also depends on training intensity.

2057
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,280
Many people benefit from having one or two

2058
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,890
full rest days per week.

2059
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:02,310
At least one, some people don't need to.

2060
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:06,310
But if you are not able
to extend that exhale

2061
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:10,600
on the carbon dioxide tolerance
test past 60 seconds or so,

2062
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,090
45 seconds, 60 seconds chances are,

2063
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:16,110
your so-called sympathetic nervous system,

2064
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:18,290
your stress system is chronically elevated

2065
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:20,340
and you're not really putting the brake

2066
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,570
on that system enough.

2067
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,210
And that's a subconscious thing.

2068
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,740
There are ways that you
can accelerate recovery,

2069
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:28,140
but I would encourage you to
listen to the previous episode.

2070
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,890
It's time-stamped for
how to assess recovery.

2071
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,490
So how often to program these things

2072
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:34,670
will depend on the other
things you're doing.

2073
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:36,040
I think it's perfectly reasonable

2074
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,380
to do this type of training
with other types of training.

2075
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,960
And I'll talk about a variety
of combinations of those

2076
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,260
toward the end of the episode.

2077
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:47,210
I do want to talk about
how to deliver more energy

2078
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,680
and oxygen.

2079
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,330
These are tools that are extremely useful,

2080
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:54,450
I believe and that are
grounded in physiology.

2081
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:57,040
That three things I'd like to talk about,

2082
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,260
are how to breathe?

2083
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:03,900
What to do immediately after
training and hydration?

2084
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,450
And I promise I will get
back into programming

2085
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:07,550
and sort of protocols,

2086
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,666
but these are vitally
important to your ability

2087
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:13,660
to perform endurance work in particular.

2088
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:17,440
And they are grounded
in how neurons and blood

2089
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,670
and oxygen and your heart work together.

2090
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:22,833
So let's first talk about
breathing or respiration.

2091
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,590
We breathe a couple of different ways,

2092
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:27,410
but let's just remind
ourselves why we breathe?

2093
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:30,080
We breathe to bring
oxygen into our system,

2094
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,500
and we breathe to get
rid of carbon dioxide.

2095
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,450
And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide

2096
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:39,030
in order to utilize fuel and
for our brain and body to work.

2097
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:42,400
It's not the oxygen is good
and carbon oxide is bad.

2098
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,300
They have to be present
in the appropriate ratios.

2099
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,080
So one thing that is
very clear is our ability

2100
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,020
to deliver oxygen to working
muscles enter our brain

2101
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:55,710
is going to be important for our ability

2102
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,380
to generate muscular effort

2103
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,530
especially of a kind of what
I was talking about today,

2104
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:01,290
but also weight training and other forms

2105
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:03,070
of skill-based effort, et cetera.

2106
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,870
And our ability to think.

2107
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:06,360
If you're holding your
breath for too long,

2108
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,990
if you're breathing too much,

2109
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:10,150
if you're what they call
over-breathing or under breathing,

2110
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:11,140
if you're shallow breathing,

2111
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:12,070
if you're mouth breathing,

2112
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:15,300
these are all things that
can really impede mental

2113
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,190
and physical performance.

2114
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:17,820
So let's make it really simple

2115
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:21,243
and then I promise to do a
future episode all about recipes.

2116
01:27:21,243 --> 01:27:24,900
There are two main sources
of air for your body

2117
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,320
and it's air coming in through your nose

2118
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,670
and air coming in through your mouth.

2119
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:30,790
In general nasal breathing is better.

2120
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:34,580
It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.

2121
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:37,640
You have a microbiome in
your nose that benefits.

2122
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,870
There are a number of reasons,

2123
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:41,310
it's also just a more efficient
system believe it or not,

2124
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:42,910
even though it feels like
you can gulp more air

2125
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:43,910
with your mouth.

2126
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:47,950
Getting good at nasal breathing is useful.

2127
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:50,260
A gear - System of the
type that Brian McKenzie

2128
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,370
and colleagues have developed,

2129
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,970
I think is a good way
to conceptualize this.

2130
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:54,890
If you're doing long duration work,

2131
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:56,460
try and do it all nasal breathing.

2132
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:58,070
If you have deviated septum,

2133
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:01,430
it's probably cause you
don't nasal breathe enough.

2134
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:06,020
Mouth breathing is something
that many people suffer from.

2135
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,780
You are more prone to infections.

2136
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,560
It's not as efficient, et cetera.

2137
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,910
There is a place for mouth breathing.

2138
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:15,910
However, it's usually, if you
need to do a strong exhale,

2139
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:19,580
oftentimes you can discard
more volume through the mouth,

2140
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,000
unless you're very trained
at nasal breathing.

2141
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,850
So if you're doing high
intensity training,

2142
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:26,900
a good way to conceptualize
this is to exhale

2143
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,790
on the max effort,

2144
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:32,900
and then to inhale on
the less intense part.

2145
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,890
So that might be as you're
generating the movement,

2146
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:37,840
you know, you're in the
concentric part of the movement

2147
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,460
you exhale, right?

2148
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,730
Just like on a bat swing
or something like that,

2149
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:44,120
or fighters and martial artists

2150
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,180
do this differently depending
on how they were trained

2151
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:47,140
and their different purposes,

2152
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:49,040
but they kind of like huh or ssh,

2153
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,440
they kind of exhaling during the effort

2154
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,860
and then inhaling on the
portion of the repetition

2155
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,410
that is not the highest effort portion.

2156
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:59,640
Usually that's the eccentric phase

2157
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:03,023
of anything involving or
rowing and things of that sort.

2158
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:07,050
So nasal breathing is great,

2159
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,500
but as you increase the
intensity of your endurance work,

2160
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,790
you will need to incorporate the mouth.

2161
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:12,080
So a gear system would look something

2162
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,250
like first gear would
be just nasal breathing

2163
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,400
or second gear would also
be just nasal breathing.

2164
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,660
But with more effort, third gear again,

2165
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:20,460
power speed endurance has
a lot more about this.

2166
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,880
You can go to their website.

2167
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:24,780
I think it's a very intelligent
way to conceptualize this.

2168
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:28,210
As you go into more max effort,

2169
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:30,500
then you're going to third
and fourth and fifth gear.

2170
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,800
And at some point you're not
thinking about nose or mouth.

2171
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,420
You're just trying to
hang on for dear life

2172
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,240
and complete the work safely.

2173
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:38,200
And that means breathe through

2174
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,730
whatever orifice works for you.

2175
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:45,250
So that's one aspect, nose versus mouth.

2176
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,710
The other aspect is whether
or not you're using your ribs,

2177
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:50,650
the intercostal muscles are these muscles

2178
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:54,990
that the Bruce Lee had these
remarkable intercostal muscles

2179
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:58,700
that allow you to lift the
rib cage or the diaphragm

2180
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,810
which is a skeletal muscle
that sits below the lungs.

2181
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:02,130
Just to remind you, when you inhale,

2182
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,200
the diaphragm moves down,

2183
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:07,190
when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

2184
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:08,580
Okay?

2185
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,370
Here's something that most people don't do

2186
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:12,920
and would benefit tremendously from.

2187
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,840
And I can say this
because Andy Galpin's lab

2188
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:18,680
has done work on this
exploring how warming up

2189
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,700
the intercostals and the
nerve to diaphragm pathways

2190
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,130
before any kind of endurance work

2191
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:26,430
or in the first few
minutes of endurance work

2192
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,880
can allow you to breathe more deeply

2193
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,569
and to deliver more oxygen to the blood,

2194
01:30:31,569 --> 01:30:33,130
[burps] excuse me,

2195
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:36,810
and to the muscles and to
be able to do more work

2196
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:37,900
more efficiently.

2197
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:40,370
So what that involves
is sometimes sitting,

2198
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,420
sometimes standing and
just really concentrating

2199
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:43,590
on two things.

2200
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,170
We always hear about how we
should diaphragmatic breathe.

2201
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:49,010
And that means that our belly
moves out when we inhale.

2202
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:51,370
So [inhales deeply] our stomach expands,

2203
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:54,220
but also expanding the intercostals

2204
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,700
which means actually raising
the ribs, chest breathing.

2205
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,370
We're all told that in yoga class

2206
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,630
don't breathe with your
chest this, [inhales deeply].

2207
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:04,510
But actually that is warming
up the intercostal muscles.

2208
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:07,240
So this is also a great
way to generate adrenaline

2209
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,430
if you do it a little bit intensely.

2210
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,290
So let's say you're feeling
unmotivated to train,

2211
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:14,850
I don't particularly like
doing endurance training

2212
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,250
until I'm actually doing it.

2213
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,450
So I use and benefit
from having a practice

2214
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:22,230
where I'll just sit there
and for about three minutes

2215
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,600
I'll just breathe very deeply
trying to raise my chest

2216
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,480
as much as I can for maybe a minute,

2217
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,940
and then contracting my diaphragm

2218
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:32,410
and expanding my stomach
outward when I inhale.

2219
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:35,110
By the end of that you're
actually delivering more oxygen

2220
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:36,033
to your system.

2221
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:39,660
My lab has looked at this in
a totally different context.

2222
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,400
Andy's lab has looked at it in the context

2223
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,740
of physical performance.

2224
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:47,330
So warming up the breathing
muscles should make sense,

2225
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:50,280
given that you now know
that muscles and neurons

2226
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:53,880
need glucose and they need
oxygen in order to function.

2227
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,930
And so that's a great warmup.

2228
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:56,740
You can also do this while walking

2229
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:59,130
or while getting on the
bike and starting to peddle,

2230
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:01,530
really starting to think about warming up

2231
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,950
the breathing system.

2232
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,100
And then you can decide if
you want to do pure nasal

2233
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,850
or a combination of nasal and
mouth breathing and so on.

2234
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:10,410
So that's something that
we don't often hear about.

2235
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:11,720
The other one.

2236
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,840
The other tool, rather that I talked about

2237
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,330
in a previous episode,
I'll just mention again,

2238
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:17,660
is some people when they
do endurance type work

2239
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:19,340
they get a stitch in their side.

2240
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,550
They feel like they've got a side cramp.

2241
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:26,550
Very rarely is it actually
a skeletal muscular cramp,

2242
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,790
it's oftentimes it's a referenced
pain of the phrenic nerve

2243
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:32,900
that innervates the liver.

2244
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,300
So the phrenic nerve is responsible

2245
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,263
for the movement of the diaphragm.

2246
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,080
It is a very important system,

2247
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,320
but it has a number of
what we call collateral.

2248
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,120
So it branches to other organs.

2249
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,840
Runs over other organs.

2250
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,820
Sometimes when we're breathing shallow

2251
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:48,570
and we are in physical motion

2252
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:50,370
and we're engaging in physical effort,

2253
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:51,750
we'll feel that side stitch.

2254
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,100
And we think, oh, I've got a
cramp or maybe I'm dehydrated

2255
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,010
or maybe I need to run
with my hands over my head,

2256
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:57,970
excuse me.

2257
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,520
Typically, you can
relieve that side cramp,

2258
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,710
which isn't a cramp at all.

2259
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:04,620
That side stitch by doing
the double inhale, exhale,

2260
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,710
really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply]

2261
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,830
And then sneaking a
little bit more air in.

2262
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:12,350
That's a double kind of firing

2263
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:14,480
or what we call volume of action potential

2264
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:18,070
sent from the phrenic
nerve to the diaphragm,

2265
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,600
which will also activate that collateral,

2266
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,520
that branch literally of the nerve

2267
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,970
that innervates the liver.

2268
01:33:23,970 --> 01:33:26,320
And then when you exhale,

2269
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,180
you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide,

2270
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:31,790
but if you repeat that a few times often,

2271
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:34,010
in fact, for me every time
but often what'll happen

2272
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:36,330
is that side stitch will
just naturally disappear.

2273
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:38,070
Just means you're not breathing properly.

2274
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:40,840
You're the phrenic
nerve is firing in a way

2275
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,490
that's kind of aggravating
that referenced pain.

2276
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:45,950
There's nothing kind of voodoo
or mysterious about this.

2277
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:48,780
It just has to do with the
way that the different nerves

2278
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,260
travel in the body.

2279
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,080
So as you set out on your run

2280
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,880
or maybe you're going to do
some muscular endurance work

2281
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,780
or high intensity work,

2282
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,620
warming up the intercostals,

2283
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:01,160
warming up the diaphragm is good.

2284
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,890
And there are exercises and there is work

2285
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:06,380
that you can do to
strengthen the intercostals

2286
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,480
and to strengthen the diaphragm

2287
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,240
during bouts of this kind of effort.

2288
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,060
And I would say that one of the ways

2289
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:14,737
that you can do that best
is by really focusing

2290
01:34:14,737 --> 01:34:19,210
on getting the maximum
diaphragmatic expansion

2291
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:20,700
and chest lifting.

2292
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,960
What we're all told now not to do,

2293
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,840
you know, don't chest
breathe, belly breathe.

2294
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,640
The intercostals are there for a reason

2295
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,317
and they are perfectly
good at filling your lungs.

2296
01:34:27,317 --> 01:34:29,120
And they work best when they collaborate

2297
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,240
with your diaphragm.

2298
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,780
But when you are starting to fatigue

2299
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:35,100
to start to really inhale deeply

2300
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,780
and try and really expand those to deliver

2301
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:39,310
more oxygen to your system.

2302
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:41,230
While we're talking about
delivering more oxygen

2303
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,270
to your system,

2304
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,070
I want to share with you a useful tool

2305
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:47,070
that will now make total sense
mechanistically why it works,

2306
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:51,070
which is oftentimes when
we are on a long run

2307
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:53,453
or in long duration bouts of effort.

2308
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,060
We will hit the so-called wall, right?

2309
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:57,893
We will bonk.

2310
01:34:57,893 --> 01:34:59,210
I think they used to call it,

2311
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:00,760
do they still call it that Costello?

2312
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,410
He's asleep.

2313
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,243
We bonk.

2314
01:35:03,243 --> 01:35:05,840
Where we just we think
no, we can't continue.

2315
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,750
It's a curious thing as to
whether or not that's neural

2316
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,760
or whether or not it's fuel-based,

2317
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,940
there's certainly going
to be a psychological

2318
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,490
or motivational component.

2319
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:17,830
But one way that you can
reveal this kind of extra gear,

2320
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:20,210
the capacity to push on is
by understanding the way

2321
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:24,470
that different muscle fibers
use energy differently.

2322
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:26,917
Remember the fast-twitch
phosphocreatine system

2323
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:28,910
and the slow twitch
system that relies mainly

2324
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:30,470
on lipids and glucose.

2325
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:32,400
Okay, well, even if you
don't remember all that,

2326
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,017
if you've been running
steadily for a long time

2327
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:35,460
and you're starting to fatigue

2328
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:37,283
and you feel like it's time to quit.

2329
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,740
You may have not tapped into
an alternative fuel source.

2330
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:43,600
One thing that you can
do is you can actually

2331
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,200
increase your speed.

2332
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,870
This is also true of work
where you're doing repetitions

2333
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:49,940
with kettlebells or something.

2334
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,700
You can start to increase your speed.

2335
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:55,780
So run faster, pedal faster,
row faster, swim faster

2336
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,670
not all out sprint.

2337
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:00,400
But in doing that, you're
shifting the the muscles

2338
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,800
and the nerves over towards
utilizing a separate fuel source

2339
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,740
or a distinct fuel source.

2340
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,200
Maybe the phosphocreatine system

2341
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,460
if it's a quick about
of intense acceleration,

2342
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:14,040
or maybe it's a combination
of lipids and carbohydrates

2343
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:17,110
in your system that weren't
available to you prior.

2344
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,530
Now, of course, if you completely deplete

2345
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:19,363
your liver glycogen,

2346
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:21,400
you completely deplete everything,

2347
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,200
you're only going to be
running on stored fuel and fats

2348
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,280
and eventually you'll
start metabolizing protein,

2349
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,820
muscles themselves.

2350
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:33,590
But this is a kind of a
unique way to realize that,

2351
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:36,580
oh, you weren't out of energy at all,

2352
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:39,020
you're just over-relying
on one fuel source.

2353
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:40,530
And this is the reason why,

2354
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:43,340
especially elite athletes
are starting to both rely

2355
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,173
on carbohydrates.

2356
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:45,710
So they're doing the whole carb depletion

2357
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:46,780
then carb loading thing.

2358
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:48,350
They're loading up their
liver and their muscles

2359
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,994
with plenty of glycogen
by eating pastas and rice

2360
01:36:50,994 --> 01:36:51,879
and stuff before races.

2361
01:36:51,879 --> 01:36:56,879
But they are also ingesting
ketones during races,

2362
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:58,470
during long bouts of effort,

2363
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:00,700
because ketones can be
a quick form of energy.

2364
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:02,640
There's no reason why
you can't use ketones

2365
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,110
if they are taking exogenous
ketones and carbohydrate.

2366
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:08,730
And in combination, remember
the body is accustomed

2367
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:12,360
to using multiple fuel sources,
fatty acids, carbohydrates

2368
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,193
all these things.

2369
01:37:13,193 --> 01:37:15,780
It's only in the, you
know, of internet age

2370
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,170
that we think in terms of,

2371
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:20,750
oh, well you're either keto
or you're burning sugar,

2372
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,730
or you're fat adapted
or key or fat fasting

2373
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:26,992
or fast fasting or fat fatting.

2374
01:37:26,992 --> 01:37:28,800
Costello woke up when I said fat fatting.

2375
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,310
I'm not talking about you Costello.

2376
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:32,190
So the point is that your body

2377
01:37:32,190 --> 01:37:33,780
is used to using multiple fuel sources.

2378
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,700
So if you're kind of hitting that wall,

2379
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:38,620
sometimes accelerating can
actually allow you to tap

2380
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:41,080
into a new fuel source or
combination of fuel sources

2381
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,780
just based on the way
that muscles use fuel.

2382
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,530
So that's another tool.

2383
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:47,200
The other thing that's really
important to think about

2384
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,550
in terms of endurance
type work is hydration.

2385
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:53,130
And I think hydration is
important for all forms

2386
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:56,190
of physical work and
exercise not just endurance.

2387
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,560
The deal with hydration
is that we've been taught

2388
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:01,990
about hydration all wrong.

2389
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:05,050
But let's remember what neurons work on?

2390
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:06,930
What do they use in order to fire?

2391
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:10,670
Well, they certainly need water, right?

2392
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:12,910
We need water in our system, I should say.

2393
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:14,700
But remember they use electrolytes,

2394
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,060
sodium and potassium to
generate those action potentials

2395
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,870
to actually get neurons to contract,

2396
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:20,800
to be able, excuse me, muscles to contract

2397
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,813
and for our brain to function
and to be able to think.

2398
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:28,190
Typically, we're going to lose anywhere

2399
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:32,210
from one to five pounds of
water per hour of exercise.

2400
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:33,700
And that's going to vary tremendously,

2401
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,500
it's going to vary on weather,

2402
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,410
it's going to vary on intensity,

2403
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,020
probably more like five pounds,

2404
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:43,100
if it's hot day and you're
exercising very intensely.

2405
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,230
So about one to five pounds per hour.

2406
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:48,690
Now, you know how much you weigh.

2407
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:52,620
So if you think about
your weight in pounds,

2408
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:57,620
once you lose about one to 4%
of your body weight in water,

2409
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,870
you're going to experience
about a 20 to 30% reduction

2410
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:02,890
in work capacity.

2411
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:07,340
In your ability to generate
effort of any kind,

2412
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,850
strength, endurance, et cetera.

2413
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:12,450
You are also going to
experience a significant drop

2414
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:15,580
in your ability to think and
perform mental operations.

2415
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,813
So hydration is key.

2416
01:39:16,813 --> 01:39:18,540
Now, many people have been told,

2417
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:21,810
well, if you urinate
and your urine is clear,

2418
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:23,520
well, then you're hydrated enough.

2419
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,720
Sometimes that's true.

2420
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,330
Sometimes that's not true.

2421
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:29,700
Also and this isn't a
topic I enjoyed discussing,

2422
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,709
but a urine is a biological phenomenon.

2423
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:36,770
It's actually filtered
blood every once in a while

2424
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:38,460
and if there's a kid and
it's a family friend,

2425
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:39,777
I'll say, "Did you know that your pee

2426
01:39:39,777 --> 01:39:41,097
"is actually filtered blood?"

2427
01:39:41,097 --> 01:39:42,710
And they usually kind of go wide-eyed.

2428
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:44,040
But then they go, "Oh,
that's kind of cool."

2429
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,720
Like kids have this natural curiosity

2430
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,610
about blood and pee and stuff.

2431
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:51,190
That's not contaminated by
our preconceived notions

2432
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:53,570
of those things being gross,

2433
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,400
because you're in being filtered blood

2434
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,470
can give you some indication as to whether

2435
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:01,050
or not you're hydrated enough or not.

2436
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:03,570
And in order to really assess that,

2437
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:06,430
it's not going to be sufficient to urinate

2438
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:08,500
into another volume of water and assess

2439
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,270
whether or not your urine
is very dark or very light.

2440
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:12,530
It actually requires
urinating into a small volume

2441
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:15,050
and saying, well, is it
darker or lighter than before?

2442
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:18,103
It's not something you really
want to do most places.

2443
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,290
The etiquette of most
gyms and environments

2444
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:23,810
is not suitable for that.

2445
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:26,700
But one of the things that you can just do

2446
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,533
is you configure,

2447
01:40:27,533 --> 01:40:30,860
well, I'm going to lose one to
five pounds of water per hour.

2448
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:35,740
You can show up to exercise
reasonably hydrated

2449
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:36,910
with electrolytes.

2450
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:39,310
So potassium, sodium and
magnesium are really key.

2451
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:42,210
Yes, it's true, you can die
from drinking too much water

2452
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,500
in particular because it forces you,

2453
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,710
if you drink too much water,

2454
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:47,420
you excrete too many electrolytes

2455
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,080
and your brain will shut off.

2456
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:51,540
You'll actually your heart
will stop functioning properly.

2457
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:54,800
So you don't want to over
consume to the extreme either,

2458
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,280
but there are a number of equations

2459
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,590
that go into figuring out
how much water you need

2460
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:02,040
based on how intense
your training, et cetera,

2461
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,990
body size, et cetera.

2462
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:05,550
Just remember you burn,
you lose, excuse me

2463
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:08,580
about one to five pounds
of water per hour,

2464
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:09,413
depending on how hot it is,

2465
01:41:09,413 --> 01:41:11,340
and how intensely you're exercising.

2466
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,320
Once your body weight drops by one to 4%.

2467
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:15,600
So you can just figure,

2468
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,810
well, if you lose five pounds per hour,

2469
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:20,120
you exercise for two hours.

2470
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:21,520
Let's say you're about 200 pounds,

2471
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,930
that's about 10%.

2472
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:23,763
Okay?

2473
01:41:23,763 --> 01:41:27,490
Well, you want to replace that
before you very quickly or not.

2474
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:29,140
You want to replace that all along

2475
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,570
before you start experiencing

2476
01:41:30,570 --> 01:41:33,890
this massive 20 to 30% reduction
in work capacity of muscles

2477
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:34,723
and the brain.

2478
01:41:34,723 --> 01:41:36,080
A simple formula.

2479
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,120
What I call it, the Galpin equation.

2480
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:41,260
Hereafter, referred to
as the Galpin equation

2481
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:44,590
is a formula that gets you
close to the exact amount

2482
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:47,510
that you would want that Dr.
Andy Galpin came up with,

2483
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:50,130
which is your body weight in pounds

2484
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:52,200
divided by the number 30.

2485
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,220
And that is how many
ounces you should drink

2486
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:57,310
for every 15 minutes of exercise.

2487
01:41:57,310 --> 01:41:59,620
So once again, the Galpin equation.

2488
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:03,490
Your body weight in pounds divided by 30.

2489
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:08,490
That's the amount of fluid
to drink in ounces, right?

2490
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:12,420
Every 15 minutes of exercise.

2491
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:13,880
Now, if you are sweating a lot,

2492
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,060
you may need more.

2493
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:15,893
Okay?

2494
01:42:15,893 --> 01:42:17,800
If you're already very well hydrated,

2495
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,120
you may need less,

2496
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,999
but that's a good rule of thumb to begin

2497
01:42:21,999 --> 01:42:24,810
and to start to understand
the relationship

2498
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:27,490
between hydration and performance.

2499
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:32,250
There is a phenomenon in
which gastric emptying,

2500
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:34,450
the ability to move stuff out of your gut,

2501
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:37,440
including water and
electrolytes out of your gut

2502
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,900
and into the bloodstream and for delivery

2503
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,920
to the tissues of your body for effort

2504
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,380
is hindered when you get
above 70% of your VO2 max.

2505
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:48,470
In other words when you're
doing high intensity training

2506
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:51,280
sometimes people experience
that ingesting water

2507
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,940
during intense training is difficult.

2508
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:57,940
It is something that can
be actually trained up.

2509
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:00,840
It's a matter of learning to kind of relax

2510
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,730
your abdominal muscles.

2511
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:05,680
And there's some other
aspects of adaptation

2512
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:09,380
that will allow you to drink
during higher intensity work.

2513
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:14,027
As Galpin says, don't
try and ingest fluids

2514
01:43:14,027 --> 01:43:16,950
when you're working out or competing

2515
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:18,840
at higher than 70% of VO2 max

2516
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,860
if you've never done it before.

2517
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,930
You want to train up this capacity.

2518
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,380
People can learn how to
consume fluids during a race

2519
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:27,060
or consume fluids during bouts of exercise

2520
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:28,790
that are very intense.

2521
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:30,440
And a lot of people don't want to do that,

2522
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,750
'cause they don't want to have
to stop to urinate, et cetera.

2523
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:35,500
But given the crucial role of hydration

2524
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,640
for muscular performance
and for brain performance,

2525
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,660
it seems that if you're
going to be doing a lot

2526
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,790
of high intensity interval training

2527
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:45,170
of the various concepts talked about today

2528
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,960
or high intensity training of any kind

2529
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,040
that hydration is key and learning

2530
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,180
or in other words, getting
your system to adapt

2531
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,630
to ingesting fluids in the
middle of these workouts

2532
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:55,660
is something that seems beneficial.

2533
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:58,290
At least to me, in terms of the trade off

2534
01:43:58,290 --> 01:44:01,350
between being dehydrated
and the somewhat discomfort

2535
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:02,470
of maybe drinking some fluids.

2536
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:04,670
So you sip small amounts
of fluid initially

2537
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:06,680
and then you're able to
take bigger and bigger gulps

2538
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,513
as time goes on.

2539
01:44:07,513 --> 01:44:11,710
And pretty soon you're able
to drink mid-set or be,

2540
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:13,110
excuse me, not mid-set.

2541
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:15,120
Please don't do that between
sets and your workout

2542
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,410
or while you're still breathing
hard after a mile repeat

2543
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:20,010
or something of that sort
without much disruption

2544
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:22,040
or any at all to your performance.

2545
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,260
Last episode we talked
about how to assess recovery

2546
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,220
and things that you might want
to do to improve recovery,

2547
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:29,760
how exposure to ice baths

2548
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,620
and cold showers can reduce inflammation

2549
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,550
which can be great for recovery,

2550
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:36,700
but can inhibit some of the adaptations

2551
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:37,970
for strength and hypertrophy.

2552
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,540
Because inflammation isn't good or bad.

2553
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:43,940
Inflammation isn't like a
nice person or a mean person.

2554
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:44,880
It's both.

2555
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,600
It's a great thing for
stimulating adaptations,

2556
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,330
but you don't want it around too long.

2557
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:52,460
And so we suggested that
you not do ice baths

2558
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,660
within probably six hours of any training

2559
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:58,770
where the goal was hypertrophy
or strength training.

2560
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:00,900
There is some evidence
that getting yourself

2561
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:04,930
into an ice bath or cold
shower after endurance training

2562
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:08,847
can actually improve the
mitochondrial aspects

2563
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:12,810
of endurance exercise that
you can get improvements

2564
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,800
in mitochondrial density,

2565
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,760
and you can get improvements
in mitochondrial respiration

2566
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:20,050
by doing that afterwards

2567
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:22,120
and that it can facilitate recovery.

2568
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:24,820
That's still a bit of
a controversial area.

2569
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:26,400
I do think that what I mentioned earlier

2570
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,760
that waiting at least six hours

2571
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,630
and probably more like
24 hours between workouts

2572
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,463
is a good idea.

2573
01:45:31,463 --> 01:45:34,340
That getting at least one
full day of rest each week,

2574
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:35,610
for some people that'll be two.

2575
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,210
I have to say I'm one of these people

2576
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:40,100
that after two days of
absolutely no exercise,

2577
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:43,400
I do perform better
consistently across all aspects

2578
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,790
of physical performance and
mentally I feel better as well

2579
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:49,160
even though I load to take those days off

2580
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,200
unless I'm really exhausted

2581
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,230
it does seem to help my training.

2582
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:55,240
Some people can train seven
days a week and they're fine.

2583
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,860
I think it just is there's a
lot of individual variation.

2584
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,810
You want to work on sleep
and maximizing sleep

2585
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:01,963
for recovery nutrition,
of course, as well.

2586
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:06,400
I talked about sleep in
the first four episodes

2587
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,233
of the podcast.

2588
01:46:07,233 --> 01:46:08,770
If you have trouble with sleep

2589
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:11,130
definitely check out those episodes.

2590
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:14,750
It's very clear and a
number of sports teams

2591
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:16,840
even some folks that I work with,

2592
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:20,110
and Andy Galpin and others
are starting to incorporate

2593
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:22,630
a what's called a
parasympathetic down-regulation

2594
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:25,540
after training of any kind as
a way to accelerate recovery

2595
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,460
and enable you to do more work.

2596
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:29,540
In other words, get
back to work out sooner.

2597
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:30,610
What is parasympathetic downregulation?

2598
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:33,630
It means finishing your training

2599
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,880
and instead of just hopping on the phone

2600
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,400
or hopping into your car

2601
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,670
and heading off to take
five minutes minimum,

2602
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:42,790
maybe ideally more like 10 or 20,

2603
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:45,220
but for sake of time five minutes minimum

2604
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:50,220
and doing just some slow pure
nasal long exhale breathing

2605
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:53,110
or lying down and just kind of zoning out.

2606
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:55,850
That it seems can accelerate recovery

2607
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:59,040
and allow you to get back
into other types of work,

2608
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,260
mental work or physical work more quickly

2609
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:05,420
which makes total sense because
remember your nervous system

2610
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:08,580
and recovery and work
is a local phenomenon

2611
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,870
which muscles were you using.

2612
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:11,430
You know, were you using your glutes,

2613
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,110
your hams and your back

2614
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,730
or were using your shoulders, et cetera.

2615
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:16,510
But it's also a systemic thing.

2616
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:17,650
It's also about those neurons

2617
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:19,457
in the locus coeruleus that
are releasing epinephrine

2618
01:47:19,457 --> 01:47:22,250
and you want to quiet all
that down after training.

2619
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:23,990
You want to really just zone out.

2620
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:26,720
Think Costello, channel
your inner Costello,

2621
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,770
and just mellow out for five to 20 minutes

2622
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:31,880
and then move into the rest of your day.

2623
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,670
Five minutes should be manageable.

2624
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,550
Even if it's just sitting in
the car with your eyes closed

2625
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:37,580
doing that downregulation breathing.

2626
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,750
I think you'll see big benefits in terms

2627
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:42,590
of allowing yourself to come back sooner,

2628
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:44,490
do more work over time

2629
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:47,340
and just perform and
feel better generally,

2630
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,150
as well as be able to
think about other things

2631
01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:51,800
besides the just how
much the previous workout

2632
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,700
kind of beat you up.

2633
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:56,030
A couple more things I think
are going to be useful.

2634
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:57,810
And I do want to just pack these in,

2635
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:00,600
'cause we are closing out the
month on physical performance.

2636
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,970
And that's about
programming and about pacing

2637
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:08,320
and the kind of mental
aspects of endurance.

2638
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,710
So let's start with pacing and
mental aspects of endurance.

2639
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:17,330
I learned from a friend and
colleague here at the podcast

2640
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:18,163
that...

2641
01:48:18,163 --> 01:48:20,650
Who's very active in triathlon
and marathon and other...

2642
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:22,310
Knows a lot about that whole world

2643
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:24,140
and the competitive landscape there,

2644
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:28,170
that pacing and literally physical pacers

2645
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,510
have a laser on the ground

2646
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:33,680
or visualizing or having a
pace car or a pace runner

2647
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:37,150
in front is actually not
allowed in many competitions.

2648
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:41,130
And if those are present
doesn't allow the race times

2649
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:45,670
to qualify as legitimate
record holding times.

2650
01:48:45,670 --> 01:48:47,420
And that's very interesting to me

2651
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:51,790
because what we know is
that the visual system

2652
01:48:51,790 --> 01:48:54,950
has this capacity to switch
back and forth between

2653
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:56,230
what we call panoramic vision

2654
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:57,980
where we're not really
focused on anything.

2655
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:59,800
Things are just flowing past us

2656
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,330
or our eyes are just kind of zoned out.

2657
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:04,640
So I can do this right now
and you won't be able to tell

2658
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,230
but I'm looking at the
corners of the room.

2659
01:49:06,230 --> 01:49:07,850
I see Costello down there on the floor.

2660
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:10,360
I see my podcast team here

2661
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,630
and I can also see the microphone.

2662
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:14,870
I can see myself in this environment.

2663
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:16,150
That's panoramic vision.

2664
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:18,310
Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location

2665
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:20,050
like right there in the
center of the camera,

2666
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:21,630
it's what's called a
vergence eye movement.

2667
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:23,860
So I'm contracting my visual window.

2668
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:27,170
The contraction of the visual
window when that's done,

2669
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:28,380
is the same thing that would happen

2670
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:31,350
if I was tracking say a
pace car or a pace runner

2671
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:33,320
or a laser on the ground.

2672
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,330
The mere bringing our eyes together

2673
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:39,010
to what we call a vergence
point has the impact

2674
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:41,790
of triggering the activation
of neural circuits

2675
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:43,080
in the thalamus.

2676
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,550
Things like zona incerta,

2677
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:46,120
if you really want to
know what their names are,

2678
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:46,953
of these brain areas.

2679
01:49:46,953 --> 01:49:49,700
As well as in the brainstem that activate

2680
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,070
the so-called alertness system,

2681
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:52,430
things like locus coeruleus,

2682
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:55,430
whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us

2683
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:56,990
into states of relaxation.

2684
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:59,760
You can actually leverage
us during your runs.

2685
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,100
Let's say you're out for a long run

2686
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:04,010
or you're swimming or you're cycling.

2687
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:06,572
This is probably easiest
to imagine out of the water

2688
01:50:06,572 --> 01:50:08,450
before I do in the water as well.

2689
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:10,640
If you focus your attention on a landmark

2690
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,370
that you're going to run to,

2691
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:14,070
you'll find that it's much easier

2692
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:17,320
than if you don't actually
have a set milestone

2693
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,340
or landmark that you're going to run to.

2694
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:21,640
However, if you were to
continue that repeatedly

2695
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:24,270
just going milestone after
milestone, after milestone,

2696
01:50:24,270 --> 01:50:26,540
you would feel more mentally fatigued

2697
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:27,700
and you would actually be able

2698
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:30,580
to degenerate less work overall.

2699
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:35,160
One thing that can be useful
is focusing on a milestone,

2700
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,190
running to that milestone or biking

2701
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:38,700
whatever it is the activity happens to be,

2702
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:40,700
and then dilating your field of view

2703
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,640
to relax the system and
then continuing again.

2704
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,190
So it's this kind of active contraction

2705
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,550
or of the visual window and then dilation

2706
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,700
of the visual window.

2707
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:51,840
Contraction of the visual
window allows you to generate

2708
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,560
more effort but there's
a cost to doing that,

2709
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,010
because neurons consume energy.

2710
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:56,800
And now you know how they do that.

2711
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,194
Whereas dilation allows you to essentially

2712
01:50:59,194 --> 01:51:01,290
be more efficient, right?

2713
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:06,290
Now, pacing is not allowed or
having a pacer, a visual pacer

2714
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:08,740
because it does allow
you to access systems

2715
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:13,010
in the brain and body that
allow you to create more energy,

2716
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:13,843
more effort.

2717
01:51:13,843 --> 01:51:14,940
And so I find it interesting

2718
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,270
that I think in a kind
of subconscious genius

2719
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:20,420
the race officials and
the governing bodies

2720
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:21,820
of these races have said,

2721
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:24,400
okay, sure, having a pacer
there or someone in front,

2722
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,390
you can draft off of them,

2723
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:28,480
there's actually a kind
of a aerodynamic effect

2724
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,410
of having someone in front of you

2725
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:33,490
that makes it easier to run in
the wake of their airstream.

2726
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:34,430
So to speak.

2727
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:36,290
Same as true in cycling.

2728
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,920
This is why the cycling teams are so good

2729
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,120
at maneuvering and packs.

2730
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:42,320
In very specific ways, you
can go faster with less effort

2731
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,230
if you're drafting as it's
called behind somebody.

2732
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:48,700
But as well where you place
your vision will allow you

2733
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:50,280
to generate more effort.

2734
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:52,100
And so it's interesting
that they've taken out

2735
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:55,260
this kind of, if you will,

2736
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,430
performance enhancing tool.

2737
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:59,730
I imagine and I have to imagine

2738
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:01,020
it's the appropriate word here.

2739
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:06,020
That good runners, good
cyclists have the ability

2740
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:10,420
to create a kind of
pacer in their minds eye.

2741
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,740
I have to imagine that they're
not just completely allowing

2742
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:13,810
their attention to drift,

2743
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:16,390
although they do that when they
want to be in highly efficient

2744
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:18,640
mode generating effort
without having to tax

2745
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,770
their mental capacity.

2746
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:22,730
And remember mental
capacity is neural energy

2747
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:25,480
and consumes glucose energy
that they could devote

2748
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,990
to the functioning of their body.

2749
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,640
But that when needed that they
can focus their energy in,

2750
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:34,270
and actually kind of chase a
mental pacer or pick milestone.

2751
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:37,410
So this is a mental game
that you can play as well.

2752
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:39,790
It's a little bit hard to do
in the context of weightlifting

2753
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:40,623
in the gym.

2754
01:52:40,623 --> 01:52:42,700
It's more of a moving
through space kind of thing,

2755
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:46,010
but some people do this by
counting reps, et cetera.

2756
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,820
I think it's especially
suitable for endurance type

2757
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:52,180
of exercise, especially done outside.

2758
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:54,010
One of the reasons I hate
running on a treadmill

2759
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:56,020
is it just feels like it's never ending.

2760
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:58,090
And I've never tried one
of these Peloton things.

2761
01:52:58,090 --> 01:52:59,450
I try and avoid looking at screens

2762
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:01,210
as much as I possibly can.

2763
01:53:01,210 --> 01:53:03,430
But if you try this next
time you're out for a run

2764
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:04,263
or a swim.

2765
01:53:04,263 --> 01:53:05,720
What you'll find is
that you have a capacity

2766
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:09,750
to engage a system of higher energy output

2767
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,680
when you focus your eyes
on a particular location,

2768
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,310
but you want to use that judiciously

2769
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:15,000
because your goal of course,

2770
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,660
is to become efficient at
moving through space over time

2771
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:19,890
and not taxing your brain
and body to the point

2772
01:53:19,890 --> 01:53:22,530
where you arrive at the end of that,

2773
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:25,670
unless it's race day just
completely tapped out.

2774
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:29,130
So that's a kind of
interesting aspect of running.

2775
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:32,020
If you're a fan of running, which I am,

2776
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:34,740
and you get the chance to look
at any of the documentaries

2777
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:37,310
or docu-drama has made
about, [clears throat]

2778
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,280
excuse me, about Steve Prefontaine.

2779
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,130
It was clear that he was mostly
in a battle with himself,

2780
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:44,440
but that he was also a highly
competitive individual.

2781
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,270
And you'll see this in some of his races.

2782
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:48,620
I do encourage you to look
some of those up on YouTube

2783
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:49,760
or see the docudramas.

2784
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,720
They're quite good.

2785
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,690
Where he ran the...

2786
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,480
Essentially was 12 laps on a track.

2787
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:56,615
It's essentially the five.

2788
01:53:56,615 --> 01:53:57,850
It is the 5,000 meter race

2789
01:53:57,850 --> 01:53:59,700
where essentially three miles.

2790
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:01,940
And he essentially tried
to sprint the whole thing

2791
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:02,790
which is ridiculous.

2792
01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:04,050
Actually knowing what you know today

2793
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:05,930
you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine

2794
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:08,520
basically was pulling
from strength, speed,

2795
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,710
power, muscular, endurance,

2796
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:12,540
long duration effort, high intensity,

2797
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,240
aerobic, anaerobic as he sort of tried

2798
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,080
to maximize every fuel system.

2799
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,700
And you'll see that in
the races that he runs,

2800
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:22,740
but that when runners are
nearing the final laps,

2801
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:24,300
the so-called bell lap of a race,

2802
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:26,200
they'll often look to one another to see

2803
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,980
where somebody is obviously
to assess their progress

2804
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:30,470
and how close somebody is?

2805
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:32,910
But when somebody gets past,

2806
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:37,300
oftentimes you'll see someone
access this mysterious kick,

2807
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:40,280
this ability to tap into
some additional gear

2808
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:43,090
that allows them to run forward or faster

2809
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:45,190
when they themselves actually thought

2810
01:54:45,190 --> 01:54:46,700
that they were maxed out.

2811
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:48,840
So someone could be running
for the finish line.

2812
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:49,990
They're convinced they're going to win.

2813
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:51,160
They're going max effort

2814
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:52,500
or at least they perceive max effort.

2815
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,550
Someone passes them.

2816
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:56,250
And all of a sudden
max effort has changed,

2817
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,970
because of that visual target

2818
01:54:57,970 --> 01:55:00,540
they are able to access higher levels

2819
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:03,060
of speed and output and
effort and performance.

2820
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,260
They don't always catch
up to that person and win,

2821
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:09,660
but having a target a
milestone is a powerful way

2822
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:13,010
that we can generate more
force and energy in anything.

2823
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:15,690
And the visual system
is the way that we bring

2824
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:18,550
those milestones into our brain,

2825
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:20,510
which then brings about epinephrin,

2826
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:22,340
which brings about neural firing,

2827
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,760
which allows us to
access whatever resources

2828
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,550
happen to be available to us.

2829
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:30,640
So I find this fascinating
because people often wonder,

2830
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:32,370
like where does the kick come from?

2831
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:35,380
Where is this kind of gift
of an additional gear?

2832
01:55:35,380 --> 01:55:37,010
Where is that deeper resource?

2833
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:39,290
And we often express it and talk about it,

2834
01:55:39,290 --> 01:55:42,680
in kind of psychological
terms like heart or willpower

2835
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,560
or that something kind of
got transplanted into us

2836
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:46,750
or descended into us.

2837
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:50,310
And not to remove any of the
spiritual aspects of sport

2838
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:54,540
or running or effort of
the human, you know, heart.

2839
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:57,270
But it's very clear
that the nervous system

2840
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:59,580
when it has a specific visual target

2841
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:02,770
can generate the sorts of intense effort

2842
01:56:02,770 --> 01:56:04,170
that it couldn't otherwise.

2843
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:05,810
And it sometimes even comes as a surprise

2844
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:08,090
to the person generating the effort.

2845
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:10,400
I promised that I would
talk about programming,

2846
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,968
meaning when and how many times a week

2847
01:56:13,968 --> 01:56:16,607
to do the various workouts
related to endurance

2848
01:56:16,607 --> 01:56:19,460
and how to merge those with
other types of exercise

2849
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:21,680
that you might be doing
for strength or yoga

2850
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:23,940
or other things that you
might be doing like work

2851
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:26,450
and other things, unrelated to exercise.

2852
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:30,620
Since that's a vast space
with many different parameters

2853
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:32,530
and you all have different
lives and lifestyles

2854
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:35,200
and backgrounds with fitness, et cetera.

2855
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,220
What I'm going to do is I'm going to put

2856
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:40,840
three different levels
if you will or protocols

2857
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:45,790
that one could adopt in
a link on the show notes.

2858
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,820
So in the caption on YouTube,

2859
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:48,940
if you click on that link,

2860
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:52,640
you'll be able to see
three possible combinations

2861
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:55,070
of endurance work, strength,
and hypertrophy work

2862
01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:58,250
or endurance work, flexibility
and hypertrophy work

2863
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:00,960
that are grounded in many
of the major publications

2864
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,500
that Dr. Andy Galpin and
colleagues and other people

2865
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,465
have described including this review

2866
01:57:05,465 --> 01:57:08,470
that's also linked there
on concurrent training

2867
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:10,770
and how one can use concurrent training,

2868
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:12,130
meaning training for endurance,

2869
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:13,030
training for strength,

2870
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,220
training for hypertrophy,

2871
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:15,490
training for all these different things

2872
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:17,270
without having to train
constantly everyday

2873
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:18,960
twice a day, et cetera.

2874
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,830
So if you are interested
in taking the protocols

2875
01:57:21,830 --> 01:57:23,577
that you learned about in this episode

2876
01:57:23,577 --> 01:57:26,210
and in previous episodes
and combining those,

2877
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:27,770
we've placed them there for you

2878
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:29,900
as a completely zero cost resource.

2879
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:32,720
Please understand they are not wholly...

2880
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,610
Costello agrees.

2881
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:34,610
They are not wholly.

2882
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:36,799
There will be variation in terms

2883
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:39,740
of what people can tolerate
and what they have time for?

2884
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:41,852
But I think they'll serve
as a useful guideline

2885
01:57:41,852 --> 01:57:46,000
in getting started or in
continuing with an expanding

2886
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,150
on existing endurance work, strength work,

2887
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:51,270
hypertrophy work and so forth.

2888
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:52,103
Just really quickly.

2889
01:57:52,103 --> 01:57:54,320
We didn't talk about
supplements much today.

2890
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,060
In the previous episodes I talked about

2891
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:58,650
the phosphocreatine system and
supplementing with creatine,

2892
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:00,020
I talked about beta alanine

2893
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,750
for kind of moderate duration work.

2894
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:05,661
You know really the only
things that have been shown

2895
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:10,661
to really improve endurance
work across the four varieties

2896
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:14,250
of endurance work I described today.

2897
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:16,550
They have essentially two forms.

2898
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:17,470
One, are stimulants.

2899
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:19,680
So things like caffeine will definitely

2900
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:22,320
improve endurance work and power output.

2901
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,500
There's a little bit of evidence

2902
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:26,130
that caffeine intake can actually inhibit

2903
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:27,720
the function of the creating system,

2904
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:30,220
but it's just one study.

2905
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:31,610
But that's interesting.

2906
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:32,580
If you want to read that study,

2907
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:35,430
you can put caffeine into www.examine.com

2908
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:37,410
and it will take you to that study.

2909
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:39,410
Many people get sore after workouts,

2910
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:40,500
in particular workouts

2911
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,570
that involve a lot of eccentric loading

2912
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,190
or workouts that are very novel

2913
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:48,690
where they've kind of pushed
it instead of moving gradually

2914
01:58:48,690 --> 01:58:51,860
as I suggest into say high
intensity anaerobic endurance

2915
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:55,120
work of three sets of 20
seconds on 100 seconds rest.

2916
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:58,090
Maybe you get over ambitious
and you do eight sets.

2917
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:00,540
In which case you are extremely sore.

2918
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:02,340
Certain forms of magnesium in particular,

2919
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:05,280
magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.

2920
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:09,270
Have been shown to be useful for removing

2921
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:12,860
or reducing the amount of
delayed onset muscle soreness.

2922
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:14,960
That form of magnesium
is distinctly different

2923
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,410
than the sorts of magnesium that are good

2924
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:17,590
for getting us into sleep.

2925
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:20,000
Things like magnesium three
and eight and Bisglycinate.

2926
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,100
And then there's this whole
thing about beet powder

2927
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:28,260
and beet juices and things
that increase nitric oxide

2928
01:59:28,260 --> 01:59:31,020
and allow for more vasodilation
and therefore delivery

2929
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:33,360
of blood to muscle and
neurons and other tissues

2930
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,990
for long bouts of endurance work.

2931
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:39,130
Some people like beet juice
and they related compounds

2932
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:41,260
that increase arginine and vasodilation.

2933
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:42,610
Some people don't.

2934
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:45,340
Some people don't feel
good when they take those.

2935
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:46,510
Some people also don't feel good

2936
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:47,870
when they take beta alanine,

2937
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:49,370
because it can give them this feeling

2938
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:52,720
of kind of like itchy, creepy
crawlies under the skin

2939
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:55,330
kind of the niacin
phenomenon, the niacin flush.

2940
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:56,360
Some people don't mind that,

2941
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:58,190
or some people don't experience that.

2942
01:59:58,190 --> 01:59:59,420
So when it comes to supplementation

2943
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:00,340
there's a lot of variety.

2944
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:04,240
But magnesium malate has
been shown to reduce soreness

2945
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:05,660
as sometimes that's good.

2946
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:08,080
Cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness

2947
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,210
things of that sort.

2948
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:14,210
But in general, we focused
mainly today on behavioral tools.

2949
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:17,920
You'll notice that all of
the tools are accessible

2950
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,400
without the need for lots of equipment.

2951
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,600
So I didn't say you need a rower,

2952
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:23,900
or you need a kettlebell
though those will work.

2953
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:27,190
And I hope I was able to
illustrate for you that endurance

2954
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:28,260
isn't just one thing.

2955
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:32,480
It's not just the ability to
go for long bouts of exercise

2956
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,460
of different kinds,

2957
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:35,010
that there's also this mental component

2958
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:36,700
because of the way that neurons work.

2959
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:39,730
And also that there are these
different forms of endurance

2960
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:40,790
of muscular endurance,

2961
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:41,680
that where you're going to fail

2962
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:45,060
'cause of the muscles and
muscle energy utilization

2963
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:47,110
and the nerves that innovate
those muscles locally

2964
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:50,680
not because of a failure to
bring in oxygen or blood.

2965
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,140
Whereas long duration effort.

2966
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,970
It's going to be more about,

2967
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:55,587
you know, being below your VO2 max,

2968
02:00:55,587 --> 02:00:58,060
and your ability to be
efficient for long bouts

2969
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:00,210
of more than 12 minutes of exercise.

2970
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:04,630
One set, as they say of 12
minutes to maybe several hours.

2971
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:07,210
I should just mention with
long duration type work.

2972
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:09,340
You know, you could even
imagine raking in the yard

2973
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,380
or mowing a lawn depending
on how big that lawn is.

2974
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:13,990
I use to have job when
I was a kid mowing lawns

2975
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:15,480
and I'll tell you,

2976
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:17,480
we didn't have many neighbors
with very big lawns,

2977
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:19,228
but there are a few of them felt huge

2978
02:01:19,228 --> 02:01:20,940
'cause they were really convoluted.

2979
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,210
And if you're pushing that mower,

2980
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:23,390
and these were the old fashioned mowers

2981
02:01:23,390 --> 02:01:24,770
not electric mowers, it's work.

2982
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:27,250
That's also of the sort
that we call long duration

2983
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:28,450
endurance work.

2984
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:29,970
High intensity training we'll tap

2985
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:32,990
into yet other fuel sources and mechanisms

2986
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:34,640
as we learned today.

2987
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:37,610
So if you are enjoying this podcast

2988
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:40,440

2989
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,040

We always release episodes on Monday,

2995
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:55,770
but we also saw sometimes release episodes

2996
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:57,520

02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,720
that you want to hear more about.

3002
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:10,260
Or if you have questions
about a given episode

3003
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:11,820
or content within an episode,

3004
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:15,190
that's where you want
to put that feedback.

3005
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:17,690
If you're not already
subscribing on Apple and Spotify

3006
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:19,310
as well, please do that.

3007
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:22,110
On Apple you can give us
up to a five-star review.

3008
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:24,110
We like to think that you would
give us a five-star review.

3009
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:26,730
But you can also leave comments on Apple

3010
02:02:26,730 --> 02:02:28,280
about the podcast more generally.

3011
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,800
And again, those are all zero cost ways

3012
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,150
that you can really help
support the podcast.

3013
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:34,390
We do have a Patreon.

3014
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:38,210
It is www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

3015
02:02:38,210 --> 02:02:40,660
at www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

3016
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:43,590
You can support the podcast
at any level that you like.

3017
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:45,750
Please also check out our
sponsors that we mentioned

3018
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,160
at the beginning of the podcast.

3019
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:48,890
I know ad reads are not the first thing

3020
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:50,530
that people want to hear
when they're getting ready

3021
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:52,020
to consume scientific information.

3022
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:55,360
Please understand that the
ads and the sponsors allow us

3023
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,530
to bring the zero cost
to consumer information

3024
02:02:57,530 --> 02:03:00,400
about science and science-related
tools to everybody.

3025
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,060
So if you have the means,
check out the sponsors.

3026
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,100
We only work with sponsors whose products

3027
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:07,160
we really believe in
and that I actually use

3028
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,610
and really love.

3029
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:10,270
There's no obligation, however.

3030
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:13,580
And we do talk about
supplements from time to time.

3031
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:15,590
Again, no obligation to use supplements.

3032
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:17,530
We also talk about behavioral tools,

3033
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:19,470
but if you are interested in supplements,

3034
02:03:19,470 --> 02:03:22,130
please go to www.examine.com
to evaluate those supplements

3035
02:03:22,130 --> 02:03:23,300
and their various effects.

3036
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:24,900
If you're curious about that.

3037
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:29,320
And we work with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

3038
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:32,000
Thorne is a supplement manufacturer

3039
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,370
that we believe has the
highest levels of stringency

3040
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:36,750
in terms of the quality
of the supplements.

3041
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:39,880
And they are very precise
and very stringent

3042
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:42,920
about the amounts of
each of those compounds

3043
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:44,050
in the given supplements.

3044
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:47,350
This is a huge problem elsewhere
in the supplement industry.

3045
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:50,160
Many brands don't include
what they say they include

3046
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:50,993
on the bottle.

3047
02:03:50,993 --> 02:03:54,470
It seems to show up every time
people test different brands.

3048
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,580
But Thorne continually tests out

3049
02:03:56,580 --> 02:03:59,260
with the highest levels of
accuracy and stringency.

3050
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:00,970
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

3051
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:05,640
you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.

3052
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,710
And if you do that you can
see all the supplements

3053
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:08,543
that I take.

3054
02:04:08,543 --> 02:04:11,610
You can get 20% off any of
those supplements as well.

3055
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:14,650
If you want to navigate
into the main Thorne site

3056
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:16,610
and you see a supplement
that you're interested in,

3057
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:19,660
you'll also get 20% off any
of those supplements as well.

3058
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:23,400
So that's www.thorne.com/u/huberman.

3059
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:26,730
So we have both cost-free and other ways

3060
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:28,540
to help support the podcast.

3061
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:31,360
If you know people that might
be interested in the podcast

3062
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,260
and benefit from the information,

3063
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:34,360
please recommend it to them.

3064
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:35,260
That really helps us.

3065
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:38,340
If you're on Instagram,
check us out @hubermanlab.

3066
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:40,510
If you're on Twitter,
it's also @hubermanlab.

3067
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:41,980
And please check out our new website

3068
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:43,960
which is www.hubermanlab.com.

3069
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,710
There you can find all the
episodes of all the podcasts

3070
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:49,510
batched according to
topic in every format,

3071
02:04:49,510 --> 02:04:51,920
YouTube, Apple and Spotify
with links out to those.

3072
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:54,510
It's searchable by keywords
that you're interested in.

3073
02:04:54,510 --> 02:04:56,790
So sleep or exercise,
weight training, strength,

3074
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:58,550
fat loss, et cetera.

3075
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:00,740
And you can subscribe to our newsletter,

3076
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:02,270
the Neural Network which will allow you

3077
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:05,750
to get zero cost updates
about speaking events,

3078
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:08,531
about any book releases or exciting things

3079
02:05:08,531 --> 02:05:11,000
that I'm reading that I
think you would enjoy reading

3080
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:11,833
as well.

3081
02:05:11,833 --> 02:05:14,270
As well as protocols related
to science in some summary

3082
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:16,310
and important notes from the podcast.

3083
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:20,220
And last but not least on
behalf of myself and Costello

3084
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,860
who's finally waking up for...

3085
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:24,050
Oh, no, he went back to sleep.

3086
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:25,760
Thank you for your interest in science.

3087
