00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,750
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,850
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,530
(upbeat guitar music)

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,680
I'm Andrew Huberman

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,720
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,660
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,850
For today's podcast
we're going to talk about

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,420
the parts list of the nervous system.

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,070
Now that might sound boring,

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,050
but these are the bits and pieces

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,530
that together make up everything

13
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,410
about your experience of life,
from what you think about

14
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,610
to what you feel, what you imagine,

15
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,619
and what you accomplish

16
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,720
from the day you're born
until the day you die.

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,350
That parts list is really incredible

18
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,277
because it has a history
associated with it

19
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:45,390
that really provides a window
into all sorts of things

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,650
like engineering, warfare,
religion, and philosophy.

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,970
So I'm going to share
with you the parts list

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,010
that makes up who you are

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,870
through the lens of some of
those other aspects of life

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,090
and other aspects

25
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,130
of the history of the discovery
of the nervous system.

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,560
By the end of this podcast

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,470
I promise you're going
to understand a lot more

28
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,353
about how you work and how
to apply that knowledge.

29
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,160
There's going to be a little bit of story.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,220
There's going to be a lot of discussion

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,400
about the people who made
these particular discoveries.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,310
There'll be a little bit
of technical language.

33
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,180
There's no way to avoid that.

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,490
But at the end you're
going to have in hand

35
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,010
what will be the equivalent

36
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,830
of an entire semester of learning

37
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,060
about the nervous system and how you work

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,260
So a few important points
before we get started.

39
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,940
I am not a medical doctor.

40
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,700
That means I don't prescribe anything.

41
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,730
I'm a professor, so sometimes
I'll profess things.

42
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,960
In fact, I profess a lot of things.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,600
We are going to talk about
some basic functioning

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,840
of the nervous system parts and et cetera,

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,860
but we're also going to talk

46
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,740
about how to apply that knowledge.

47
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,380
That said, your healthcare, your wellbeing

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,470
is your responsibility.

49
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,897
So anytime we talk about tools

50
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,930
please filter it through
that responsibility.

51
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,290
Talk to a healthcare professional

52
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,010
if you're going to explore
any new tools or practices

53
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,290
and be smart in your
pursuit of these new tools.

54
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,250
Also wanna emphasize that this podcast

55
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,570
and the other things I do on social media

56
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,590
are my personal goal of bringing

57
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,150
zero cost to consumer information
to the general public.

58
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,590
It is separate from my role
at Stanford University.

59
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,320
In that spirit I really want to thank

60
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,670
the sponsors of today's podcast.

61
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,870
The first one is Athletic Greens

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,380
which is an all-in-one drink.

63
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,450
It's a greens drink

64
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,260
that has vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, prebiotics.

65
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,310
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

66
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,220
so I'm really delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

67
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,817
The reason I like it is because

68
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:44,580
I like vitamins and minerals,

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,530
I think they're important to my health

70
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,140
and it can be kind of overwhelming to know

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,320
what to take in that landscape.

72
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,810
So by taking one thing

73
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,040
that also happens to taste really good

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,950
I get all the vitamins minerals,
et cetera, that I need.

75
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,040
There's also a lot of data there now

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,810
about the importance of the gut microbiome

77
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,900
for immune health and
for the gut brain access,

78
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,110
all these things.

79
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,570
And the probiotics and prebiotics

80
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,510
are important to me for that reason.

81
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,100
If you want to try Athletic Greens

82
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,730
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

83
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,300
and put in the code word
Huberman at checkout.

84
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,290
If you do that

85
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,090
they'll send you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

86
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,530
There's a lot in the news lately

87
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,100
about the importance of vitamin D3.

88
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,440
We can all get vitamin D3 from sunlight

89
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,900
but many of us aren't
getting enough sunlight.

90
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,530
Vitamin D3 has been shown to be relevant

91
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,800
to the immune system and the
hormone systems, et cetera.

92
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,633
So once again

93
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:41,440
that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,770
enter Huberman at checkout,

95
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,520
and you get the year supply of D3 and K2

96
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,730
along with your Athletic Greens.

97
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,360
This podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,870
which is a health monitoring company.

99
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,280
It uses blood tests and
saliva tests to look at things

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,872
like DNA and metabolic markers

101
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,440
and monitors your hormones,

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,100
a huge number of different
parameters of health

103
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,420
that really can only
be measured accurately

104
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,540
through blood and saliva tests.

105
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,380
I use Inside Tracker because
I'm a big believer in data.

106
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,370
There's a lot of aspects to our biology

107
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,790
that can only be accurately measured

108
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,440
by way of blood tests and saliva tests.

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,700
The thing that's really
nice about Inside Tracker

110
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,350
is that rather than just giving
you a bunch of numbers back

111
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,100
of the levels of these
things in your body,

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,150
it gives you, through a
really simple platform,

113
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,260
information about what to do

114
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,230
with all those levels of hormones

115
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,490
and metabolic markers, et cetera.

116
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,660
It also has a feature which
is particularly interesting

117
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,690
which it measures your inner age,

118
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,300
which is more a measure
of your biological age

119
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,430
as opposed to your chronological age.

120
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,560
And all that information is organized

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,790
so that you can make changes

122
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,930
in your nutritional regimes
or your exercise regimes

123
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,940
and watch how those
markers change over time.

124
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,390
So if you want to try Inside Tracker

125
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,710
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

126
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,040
and they'll give you 25% off at checkout.

127
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,580
So let's talk about the nervous system.

128
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,710
The reason I say your nervous
system and not your brain

129
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,060
is because your brain is
actually just one piece

130
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,070
of this larger, more
important thing, frankly,

131
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,890
that we call the nervous system.

132
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,930
The nervous system includes
your brain and your spinal cord

133
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,670
but also all the connections
between your brain

134
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,550
and your spinal cord and
the organs of your body.

135
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,220
It also includes, very importantly,

136
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,510
all the connections between your organs

137
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,560
back to your spinal cord and brain.

138
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,220
So the way to think about how
you function at every level

139
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,100
from the moment you're
born until the day you die,

140
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,910
everything you think and
remember and feel and imagine

141
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,030
is that your nervous system
is this continuous loop

142
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,310
of communication between the
brain, spinal cord, and body

143
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,270
and body, spinal cord, and brain.

144
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,900
In fact, we really can't
even separate them.

145
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,751
It's one continuous loop.

146
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,230
You may have heard of something
called a Mobius strip.

147
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,670
A Mobius strip is almost like one of

148
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,410
these impossible figures
that no matter which angle

149
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,243
you look at it from

150
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,180
you can't tell where it
starts and where it ends.

151
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,490
And that's really how your
nervous system is built.

152
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,529
That's the structure that
allows you to, for instance,

153
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,530
deploy immune cells,

154
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,430
to release cells that
will go kill infection

155
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,880
when you're in the presence of infection.

156
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,470
Most people just think about that

157
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,350
as a function of the immune system

158
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,030
but actually it's your nervous system

159
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,970
that tells organs like your spleen

160
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,071
to release killer cells
that go and hunt down

161
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:37,660
those bacterial and viral
invaders and gobble them up.

162
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,550
If you have a stomach ache, for instance,

163
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,610
sure, you feel that in your stomach,

164
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,310
but it's really your nervous system

165
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,520
that's causing the stomach ache.

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,300
The ache aspect of it is
a nervous system feature.

167
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,420
So when we want to talk about experience

168
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,930
or we want to talk about how
to change the self in any way,

169
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,810
we really need to think about
the nervous system first.

170
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,760
It is fair to say

171
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,350
that the nervous system governs

172
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,320
all other biological systems of the body,

173
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,410
and it's also influenced by
those other biological systems.

174
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,900
So if we're talking
about the nervous system

175
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,240
we need to get a little
specific about what we mean.

176
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,780
It's not just this big loop of wires.

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,470
In fact, there's a
interesting story about that

178
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,450
because at the turn of the
sort of 1800s to 1900s,

179
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,550
it actually was believed

180
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,550
that our nervous system
was just one giant cell.

181
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,270
But two guys, that names
aren't super important,

182
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,620
but in fairness to their
important discovery,

183
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,370
Ramon y Cajal, a Spaniard,
Camillo Golgi, an Italian guy,

184
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,020
figured out how to label
or stain the nervous system

185
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,240
in a way that revealed, oh my goodness,

186
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,960
we're actually made up of
trillions of these little cells,

187
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,080
nerve cells that are called neurons.

188
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,020
And that's what a neuron is.

189
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,350
It's just a nerve cell.

190
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,760
They also saw

191
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,620
that those nerve cells
weren't touching one another.

192
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,580
They're actually separated by little gaps.

193
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,000
And those little gaps you
may have heard of before,

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,900
they're called synapses.

195
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,100
Those synapses are where the chemicals

196
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,330
from one neuron are kind of
spit out or vomited into.

197
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,700
And then the next nerve
cell detects those chemicals

198
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,410
and then passes
electricity down its length

199
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,450
to the next nerve cell and so forth.

200
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,280
So really the way to think about
your body and your thoughts

201
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,670
and your mind is that you are
a flow of electricity, right?

202
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,030
There's nothing mystical about this.

203
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,420
You're a flow of electricity

204
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,340
between these different nerve cells.

205
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,590
And depending on which
nerve cells are active

206
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,950
you might be lifting your
arm or lowering your arm.

207
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,140
You might be seeing something
and perceiving that it's red

208
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,270
or you might be seeing something

209
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,580
and perceiving that it's green,

210
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,840
all depending on which nerve
cells are electrically active

211
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,803
at a given moment.

212
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,360
The example of perceiving
red or perceiving green

213
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,300
is a particularly good example

214
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,540
because so often our
experience of the world

215
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,480
makes it seem as if these out these things

216
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
that are happening outside us

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,980
are actually happening inside us.

218
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,310
But the language of the nervous
system is just electricity.

219
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,710
It's just like a Morse code of some sort

220
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,530
or the syllables and words and consonants

221
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,620
and vowels of language.

222
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,040
It just depends on how
they're assembled, what order.

223
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,010
And so that brings us

224
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,950
to the issue of how the
nervous system works.

225
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,260
The way to think about how
the nervous system works

226
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,860
is that our experiences, our memories,

227
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,530
everything is sort of
like the keys on a piano

228
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,940
being played in a particular order, right?

229
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,550
If I play the keys on a
piano in a particular order

230
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,010
and with a particular
intensity, that's a given song.

231
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,760
We can make that analogous
to a given experience.

232
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,430
It's not really that the key, you know,

233
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,440
A sharp or E flat is the song.

234
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,170
It's just one component of the song.

235
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,000
So when you hear that,
you know, for instance,

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,180
there's a brain area
called the hippocampus,

237
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,040
which there is, that's involved in memory.

238
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,830
Well, it's involved in memory,

239
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,910
but it's not that memories
are stored there as,

240
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,770
you know, sentences.

241
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,070
They're stored there as patterns
of electricity in neurons

242
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,740
that when repeated, give you the sense

243
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,950
that you are experiencing the thing again.

244
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,540
In fact, deja vu,

245
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,260
the sense that what you're
experiencing is so familiar

246
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,920
and like something that
you've experienced previously

247
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,320
is merely that the neurons

248
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,510
that were active in one circumstance

249
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,790
are now becoming active in
the same circumstance again.

250
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,620
And so it's really just
like hearing the same song

251
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,320
maybe not played on a piano

252
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,700
but next time on a classical guitar,

253
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,810
there's something similar about that song

254
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,120
even though it's being played
on two different instruments.

255
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,790
So I think it's important

256
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,557
that people understand the
parts of their nervous system,

257
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:38,250
and that it includes so much
more than just the brain

258
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,010
and that there are these
things, neurons and synapses.

259
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,900
But really that it's
the electrical activity

260
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,140
of these neurons that
dictates our experience.

261
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,740
So if the early 1900s were when

262
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,410
these neurons were discovered,

263
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,320
certainly a lot has happened since then.

264
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,800
And in that time between
the early 1900s and now

265
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,850
there's some important events

266
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,829
that actually happened in history

267
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,910
that gave us insight into
how the nervous system works.

268
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,610
One of the more surprising
ones was actually warfare.

269
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,170
So as most everybody knows in warfare

270
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,170
people get shot and people often die

271
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,730
but many people get
shot and they don't die.

272
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,730
And in World War One, there
were some changes in artillery,

273
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,070
in bullets that made for a situation

274
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,690
where bullets would
enter the body and brain

275
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,330
at very discrete locations

276
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,010
and would go out the other
side of the body or brain

277
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,330
and also make a very small
hole at that exit location.

278
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,905
And in doing so produced a lot

279
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,220
of naturally occurring
lesions of the nervous system.

280
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,261
Now you say, okay, well,
how does that relate

281
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,265
to neuroscience?

282
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,500
Well, unlike previous years

283
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,510
where a lot of the artillery
would create these big

284
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,890
sort of holes as the bullets

285
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,530
would blow out of the brain or body,

286
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,360
I know this is rather gruesome,

287
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,610
when the holes were very discrete

288
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,180
they entered at one point
and left at another point,

289
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,300
they would take out or destroy

290
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,460
very discrete bits of neural
tissue, of the nervous system.

291
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,100
So people were coming back from war

292
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,970
with holes in their brain

293
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,540
and in other parts of their nervous system

294
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,250
that were limited to
very specific locations.

295
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,020
In addition to that,
there was some advancement

296
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,250
in the cleaning of wounds that happened

297
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,393
so many more people were surviving.

298
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,250
What this meant was that neurologists

299
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,650
now had a collection of patients

300
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,860
that would come back and they'd have holes

301
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,310
in very specific locations of their brain.

302
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,230
And they'd say things like,
well, I can recognize faces

303
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,680
but I can't recognize who
those faces belong to.

304
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,880
I know it's a face, but I
don't know who it belongs to.

305
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,870
And after that person eventually died

306
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,070
the neurologist would figure out,

307
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,700
ah, I've had 10 patients that all told me

308
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,120
that they couldn't recognize faces.

309
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
And they all had these bullet holes

310
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,400
that went through a particular
region of the brain.

311
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,500
And that's how we know a lot

312
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,970
about how particular brain regions

313
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,870
like the hippocampus work.

314
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,010
In fact, some of the more
amazing examples of this,

315
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,540
where people would come
back and they, for instance,

316
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,902
would speak in complete gibberish

317
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:15,700
whereas previously they
could speak normally.

318
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,540
And even though they were
speaking in complete gibberish

319
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,330
they could understand language perfectly.

320
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,950
That's how we know that
speech and language

321
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,970
are actually controlled

322
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,230
by separate portions
of the nervous system.

323
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,160
And there are many examples like that.

324
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,830
People that couldn't recognize
the faces of famous people

325
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,560
or, and that actually brings us

326
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,760
to an interesting example in modern times.

327
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,190
Many, many years later in the early 2000s

328
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,978
there was actually a
paper that was published

329
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:42,890
in the journal "Nature",
excellent journal,

330
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,810
showing that in a human being,

331
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,630
a perfectly healthy human being,

332
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,890
there was a neuron that would become

333
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,140
electrically active only when the person

334
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,190
viewed the picture of
Jennifer Aniston, the actress.

335
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,100
So literally a neuron that
represented Jennifer Aniston,

336
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,570
so-called Jennifer Aniston cells,

337
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,870
neuroscientists know about
the Jennifer Aniston cells.

338
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,990
If you can recognize
Jennifer Aniston's face

339
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,840
you have Jennifer Aniston neurons,

340
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,160
and presumably also have neurons

341
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,630
that can recognize the faces

342
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,480
of other famous and non-famous people.

343
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,210
So that indicates

344
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,270
that our brain is really
a map of our experience.

345
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,090
We come into the world and
our brain has a kind of bias

346
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,960
towards learning
particular kinds of things.

347
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,890
It's ready to receive information

348
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,450
and learn that information,

349
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,660
but the brain is really
a map of experience.

350
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,630
So let's talk about what
experience really is.

351
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,440
What does it mean for your brain to work?

352
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,005
Well I think it's fair to say

353
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:42,320
that the nervous system really
does five things, maybe six.

354
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,370
The first one is sensation.

355
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,290
So this is important to understand

356
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,550
for any and all of you

357
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,530
that want to change your nervous system

358
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,560
or to apply tools to make your
nervous system work better.

359
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,200
Sensation is a non-negotiable element

360
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,420
of your nervous system.

361
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,730
You have neurons in your eye that perceive

362
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,120
certain colors of light and
certain directions of movement.

363
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,780
You have neurons in
your skin that perceive

364
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,150
particular kinds of touch,
like light touch or firm touch

365
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,970
or painful touch.

366
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,020
You have neurons in your ears
that perceive certain sounds.

367
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Your entire experience of
life is filtered by these,

368
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,510
what we call sensory receptors

369
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,810
if you want to know what the name is.

370
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,760
So this always raises
an interesting question.

371
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,430
People ask, well, is
there much more out there?

372
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,600
Is there a lot more happening in the world

373
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,330
that I'm not experiencing

374
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,600
or that humans aren't experiencing?

375
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,500
And the answer of course is yes,

376
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,230
there are many species on this planet

377
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,130
that are perceiving things
that we will never perceive

378
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,500
unless we apply technology.

379
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,190
The best example I could think
of off the top of my head

380
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,580
would be something like infrared vision.

381
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,760
There are snakes out there,
pit vipers and so forth,

382
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,110
that can sense heat
emissions from other animals.

383
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,740
They don't actually see their shape.

384
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,440
They sense their heat shape
and their heat emissions.

385
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,520
Humans can't do that

386
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,140
unless of course they
put on infrared goggles

387
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,260
or something that would allow them

388
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,390
to detect those heat emissions.

389
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,570
There are turtles and
certain species of birds

390
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,230
that migrate long distances
that can detect magnetic fields

391
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,970
because they have neurons,

392
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,570
again, it's the nervous system
that allows them to do this.

393
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,350
So they have neurons in
their nose and in their head

394
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,540
that allow them to migrate
along magnetic fields

395
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,030
in order to, as amazing as this sounds,

396
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,040
go from one particular
location in the ocean,

397
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,980
thousands of miles away

398
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,090
to all aggregate on one particular beach

399
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,600
at a particular time of year

400
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,250
so that they can mate, lay eggs,

401
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,860
and then wander back
off into the sea to die.

402
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,870
And then their young
will eventually hatch,

403
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,830
those cute little turtles
will shuffle to the ocean,

404
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,430
swim off and go do the exact same thing.

405
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,820
They don't migrate that
distance by vision.

406
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,890
They don't do it by smell.

407
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,400
They do it by sensing magnetic fields.

408
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,030
And many other species do
these incredible things.

409
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,530
We don't, humans are not
magnetic sensing organisms.

410
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,017
We can't do that

411
00:17:09,017 --> 00:17:11,670
because we don't have receptors
that sense magnetic fields.

412
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,190
There's some data that maybe some humans

413
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,890
can sense magnetic fields

414
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,500
but you should be very skeptical of anyone

415
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,200
that's convinced that they can do that

416
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,300
with any degree of robustness or accuracy,

417
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,599
because even the people that can do this

418
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,979
aren't necessarily aware that they can.

419
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,290
Maybe a topic for a future podcast.

420
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,040
So we have sensation,
then we have perception.

421
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,210
Perception is our ability
to take what we're sensing

422
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,380
and focus on it and make sense of it,

423
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,000
to explore it, to remember it.

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,610
So really perceptions are
just whichever sensations

425
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,240
we happen to be paying
attention to at any moment.

426
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,720
And you can do this right now.

427
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,580
You can experience perception

428
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,940
and the difference between
perception and sensation

429
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,320
very easily.

430
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,550
If, for instance, I tell
you to pay attention

431
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,390
to the contact of your feet,
the bottoms of your feet,

432
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,920
with whatever surface they
happen to be in contact with,

433
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,660
maybe it's shoes, maybe it's the floor,

434
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,210
if your feet are up maybe it's air.

435
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,090
The moment you place your,

436
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,870
what we call the spotlight of attention

437
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,190
or the spotlight of
perception on your feet.

438
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,880
You are now perceiving
what was happening there,

439
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,140
what was being sensed there.

440
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,880
The sensation was happening
all along however.

441
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,790
So while sensation is not negotiable

442
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,310
you can't change your receptors

443
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,770
unless you adopt some new technology,

444
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,200
perception is under the
control of your attention.

445
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,760
And the way to think about attention

446
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,253
is it's like a spotlight,
except it's not one spotlight.

447
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:40,760
You actually have two
attentional spotlights.

448
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,070
Anyone that tells you you can't multitask,

449
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,450
tell them they're wrong.

450
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,490
And if they disagree with
you tell them to contact me

451
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,490
because in old world
primates of which humans are,

452
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,720
we are able to do what's
called covert attention.

453
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,390
We can place a spotlight
of attention on something,

454
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,810
for instance, something
we're reading or looking at

455
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,130
or someone that we're listening to.

456
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,250
And we can place a second
spotlight of attention

457
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,410
on something we're
eating and how it tastes

458
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,710
or our child running around
in the room or my dog.

459
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,030
You can split your
attention into two locations

460
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,960
but of course you can
also bring your attention,

461
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,470
that is, your perception,
to one particular location.

462
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,910
You can dilate your attention

463
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,100
kind of like making a
spotlight more diffuse

464
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,150
or you can make it more concentrated.

465
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,940
This is very important to understand

466
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,900
if you're going to think about tools

467
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,830
to improve your nervous system,

468
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,240
whether or not that tool is
in the form of a chemical

469
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,090
that you decide to
take, maybe a supplement

470
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,850
to increase some chemical in your brain

471
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,820
if that's your choice,

472
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,837
or a brain machine device

473
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:45,670
or you're going to try
and learn something better

474
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,150
by engaging in some focus
or motivated pursuit

475
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,230
for some period of time each day.

476
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,550
Attention is something

477
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,370
that is absolutely under your control,

478
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,820
in particular when you're rested.

479
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,920
And we'll get back to this.

480
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
But when you are rested, and
we'll define rest very clearly,

481
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,680
you are able to direct your attention

482
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,090
in very deliberate ways.

483
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,010
And that's because we have
something in our nervous system

484
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,370
which is sort of like a two way street.

485
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,500
And that two way street is a communication

486
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,010
between the aspects of our
nervous system that are reflexive

487
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,520
and the aspects of our nervous
system that are deliberate.

488
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,180
So we all know what it's
like to be reflexive.

489
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,900
You go through life, you're walking.

490
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,130
If you already know how to walk

491
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,510
you don't think about your walking.

492
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,830
You just walk.

493
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,680
And that's because the nervous
system wants to pass off

494
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,276
as much as it can to reflexive action.

495
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:39,640
That's called bottom up processing.

496
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,700
It really just means that information

497
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,920
is flowing in through your senses,

498
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
regardless of what you're perceiving,

499
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,990
that information is flowing up

500
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,330
and it's directing your activity.

501
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,310
But at any moment, for instance,

502
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,390
let's say a car screeches in
front of you around the corner,

503
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,740
and you suddenly pause.

504
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,480
You are now moving into deliberate action.

505
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,770
You would start looking around
in a very deliberate way.

506
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,550
The nervous system can be
reflexive in its action

507
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,290
or it can be deliberate.

508
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,960
If reflexive action tends to
be what we call bottom up,

509
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,220
deliberate action and
deliberate perceptions

510
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,640
and deliberate thoughts are top down.

511
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,010
They require some effort and some focus.

512
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,940
But that's the point,

513
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,610
you can decide to focus
your attention and energy

514
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,890
on anything you want.

515
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,570
You can decide to focus your
behavior in any way you want.

516
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,090
But it will always feel

517
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,490
like it requires some
effort and some strain.

518
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,840
Whereas when you're in reflexive mode,

519
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,760
just walking and talking and
eating and doing your thing

520
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,320
it's going to feel very easy.

521
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,570
And that's because your nervous system

522
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,370
basically wired up to be able

523
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,540
to do most things easily
without much metabolic demand,

524
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,090
without consuming much energy.

525
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,080
But the moment you try and
do something very specific,

526
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,900
you're going to feel a
sort of mental friction.

527
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,480
It's going to be challenging.

528
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,010
So we've got sensations, perceptions,

529
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,120
and then we've got things

530
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,820
that we call feelings slash emotions.

531
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,820
And these get a little complicated
because almost all of us,

532
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,420
I would hope all of us,
are familiar with things

533
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,820
like happiness and sadness
or boredom or frustration.

534
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,870
Scientists argue like crazy,

535
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,350
neuroscientists and psychologists

536
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,780
and philosophers for that matter,

537
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,750
argue like crazy about what
these are and how they work.

538
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,780
Certainly emotions and feelings

539
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,060
are the product of the nervous system.

540
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,600
They involve the activity of neurons.

541
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,540
But as I mentioned earlier,
neurons are electrically active

542
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,400
but they also release chemicals.

543
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,443
And there's a certain
category of chemicals

544
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:36,270
that has a very profound influence

545
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,173
on our emotional states.

546
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,470
They're called neuromodulators.

547
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,520
And those neuromodulators
have names that probably

548
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,700
you've heard of before.

549
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,910
Things like dopamine and serotonin

550
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,053
and acetylcholine, epinephrine.

551
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,390
Neuromodulators are really interesting

552
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,770
because they bias which
neurons are likely to be active

553
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,710
and which ones are likely to be inactive.

554
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,750
A simple way to think
about neuromodulators

555
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,990
is they are sort of like playlists

556
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,740
that you would have on any kind of device

557
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,210
where you're going to play
particular categories of music.

558
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,070
So for instance, dopamine,
which is often discussed

559
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,070
as the molecule of reward or
joy, it is involved in reward.

560
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,626
And it does tend to create
a sort of upbeat mood

561
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:23,450
when released in appropriate
amounts in the brain.

562
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,740
But the reason it does
that is because it makes

563
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,060
certain neurons and neural
circuits as we call them

564
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,670
more active and others less active.

565
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,040
Okay.

566
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,400
So serotonin, for instance,

567
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
is a molecule that when released

568
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
tends to make us feel really
good with what we have,

569
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,980
our sort of internal landscape

570
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,660
and the resources that we have,

571
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,360
whereas dopamine more than
being a molecule of reward

572
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,360
is really more a molecule of motivation

573
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,243
toward things that are outside us

574
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:53,830
and that we want to pursue.

575
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,570
And we can look at healthy conditions

576
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,450
or situations like being
in pursuit of a goal

577
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,280
where every time we accomplish something

578
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,690
en route to that goal, a little
bit of dopamine is released

579
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,640
and we feel more motivation, that happens.

580
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,790
We can also look at the extreme example

581
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,150
of something like mania,

582
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,540
where somebody is so
relentlessly in pursuit

583
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,610
of external things like
money and relationships

584
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,380
that they're sort of in this
delusional state of thinking

585
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,210
that they have the
resources that they need

586
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,370
in order to pursue all these things

587
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,680
when in fact they don't.

588
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,510
So these neuromodulators can exist

589
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,760
in normal levels, low levels, high levels.

590
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
And that actually gives us a window

591
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,608
into a very important aspect
of neuroscience history

592
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,900
that all of us are impacted by today,

593
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,160
which is the discovery of antidepressants

594
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,130
and so-called anti-psychotics.

595
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,600
In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,

596
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,410
it was discovered that
there are compounds,

597
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,130
chemicals that can increase
or decrease serotonin,

598
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,840
that can increase or decrease dopamine.

599
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,010
And that led to the development

600
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,990
of most of what we call antidepressants.

601
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,030
Now, the trick here or the problem

602
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,360
is that most of these drugs,

603
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,720
especially in the 1950s and '60s,

604
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,070
they would reduce serotonin

605
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,760
but they would also reduce dopamine

606
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,090
or they would increase serotonin,

607
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,490
but they would also increase

608
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,320
some other neuromodulator chemical.

609
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,340
And that's because all these
chemical systems in the body,

610
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,480
but the neuromodulators in particular,

611
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,400
have a lot of receptors.

612
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,830
Now, these are different
than the receptors

613
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,030
we were talking about earlier.

614
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,370
The receptors I'm talking about now

615
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,750
are sort of like parking spots
where dopamine is released.

616
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,663
And if it attaches to a
receptor, say on the heart,

617
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:35,210
it might make the heart beat faster

618
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,630
because there's a certain
kind of receptor on the heart.

619
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,020
Whereas if dopamine is released

620
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,490
and goes and attaches to muscle

621
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,670
it might have a completely
different effect on the muscle.

622
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,520
And in fact, it does.

623
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,967
So different receptors on
different organs of the body

624
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,460
are the ways that these neuromodulators

625
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,780
can have all these different effects

626
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,910
on different aspects of our biology.

627
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,900
This is most salient in the example

628
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,640
of some of the antidepressants
that have sexual side effects

629
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,920
or that blunt appetite
or that blunt motivation.

630
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,320
You know, many of these
which increase serotonin

631
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,360
can be very beneficial for people.

632
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,550
It can elevate their mood.

633
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,800
It can make them feel better.

634
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,050
But they also if their,
the doses are too high

635
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,650
or if that particular drug
isn't right for somebody

636
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,400
that person experiences
challenges with motivation

637
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,840
or appetite or libido

638
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
because serotonin is binding to receptors

639
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,730
in the areas of the brain

640
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,220
that control those other things as well.

641
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,020
So we talked about sensation.

642
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,470
We talked about perception.

643
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,510
When we talk about feelings,

644
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,910
we have to consider these neuromodulators.

645
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,668
And we have to consider also
that feelings and emotions

646
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:42,770
are contextual.

647
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,550
In some cultures showing a
lot of joy or a lot of sadness

648
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,890
is entirely appropriate,

649
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,480
in other cultures it's
considered inappropriate.

650
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,860
So I don't think it's fair to say

651
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,210
that there is a sadness
circuit or area of the brain

652
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,560
or a happiness circuit
or area of the brain.

653
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,460
However, it is fair to
say that certain chemicals

654
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,070
and certain brain
circuits tend to be active

655
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,670
when we are in motivated states,

656
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,380
tend to be active when we are
in non-motivated lazy states,

657
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,630
tend to be active when we are focused

658
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,103
and tend to be active
when we are not focused.

659
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,650
I want to emphasize also

660
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,020
that emotions are something
that we generally feel

661
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,260
are not under our control.

662
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,140
We feel like they kind
of geyser up within us

663
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,220
and they just kind of happen to us.

664
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,920
And that's because they
are somewhat reflexive.

665
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
We don't really set out

666
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,100
with a deliberate thought to be happy

667
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,810
or a deliberate thought to be sad.

668
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,140
We tend to experience them

669
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,890
in kind of a passive reflexive way.

670
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,870
And that brings us to the next
thing, which are thoughts.

671
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,490
Thoughts are really interesting because

672
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,780
in many ways they're like perceptions

673
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,460
except that they draw on

674
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,480
not just what's happening in the present

675
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,320
but also things we remember from the past

676
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,120
and things that we
anticipate about the future.

677
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,060
The other thing about thoughts
that's really interesting

678
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,790
is that thoughts can be both reflexive,

679
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,690
they can just be occurring all the time

680
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,420
sort of like pop-up windows

681
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,223
on a poorly filtered web browser,
or they can be deliberate.

682
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,080
We can decide to have a thought.

683
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,130
In fact, right now you could
decide to have a thought

684
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,950
just like you would decide
to write something out

685
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,320
on a piece of paper.

686
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,680
You could decide that you're
listening to a podcast,

687
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,890
that you are in a particular location.

688
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,540
You're not just paying
attention to what's happening,

689
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,800
you're directing your thought process.

690
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,560
And a lot of people don't understand

691
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,780
or at least appreciate
that the thought patterns

692
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,600
and the neural circuits
that underlie thoughts

693
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,690
can actually be controlled
in this deliberate way.

694
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,370
And then finally there are actions.

695
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,210
Actions or behaviors are perhaps
the most important aspect

696
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,610
of our nervous system.

697
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,712
Because first of all,

698
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:46,630
our behaviors are actually the only thing

699
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,540
that are going to create any
fossil record of our existence.

700
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,160
You know, after we die, the
nervous system deteriorates,

701
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,850
our skeleton will remain.

702
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,410
But it's, you know, in the moment

703
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,560
of experiencing something very joyful

704
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,540
or something very sad, it
can feel so all encompassing

705
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,960
that we actually think
that it has some meaning

706
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,210
beyond that moment.

707
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,373
But actually for humans and
I think for all species,

708
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:16,520
the sensations, the
perceptions and the thoughts

709
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,800
and the feelings that
we have in our lifespan,

710
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,740
none of that is actually carried forward

711
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,910
except the ones that we take

712
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,960
and we convert into
actions such as writing,

713
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,470
actions such as words,

714
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,720
actions such as engineering new things.

715
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,270
And so the fossil record of
our species and each one of us

716
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,090
is really through action.

717
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,350
And that, in part, is why so
much of our nervous system

718
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,880
is devoted to converting
sensation, perceptions, feelings,

719
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,690
and thoughts into actions.

720
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,420
In fact, the great neuroscientist

721
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,410
or physiologist Sherrington
won a Nobel prize

722
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,000
for his work in mapping
some of the circuitry,

723
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
the connections between nerve cells

724
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,470
that give rise to movement.

725
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,200
And he said, "Movement is
the final common pathway".

726
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,560
The other way to think about it is that

727
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,631
one of the reasons that
our central nervous system,

728
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:14,970
our brain and spinal cord
include this stuff in our skull

729
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,150
but also connects so heavily to the body

730
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,860
is because most everything
that we experience,

731
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,630
including our thoughts and feelings,

732
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,950
was really designed to either
impact our behavior or not.

733
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,020
And the fact that
thoughts allow us to reach

734
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,010
into the past and anticipate the future

735
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,740
and not just experience
what's happening in the moment

736
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,140
gave rise to an incredible capacity

737
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,150
for us to engage in behaviors

738
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,870
that are not just for the moment,

739
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,970
they're based on things
that we know from the past

740
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,950
and that we would like
to see in the future.

741
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,850
And this aspect of our nervous
system, of creating movement,

742
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,510
occurs through some very simple pathways.

743
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,880
The reflexive pathway basically

744
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,820
includes areas of the brain stem

745
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,030
we call central pattern generators.

746
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,070
When you walk, provided you
already know how to walk,

747
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,130
you are basically walking

748
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,040
because you have these
central pattern generators,

749
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,330
groups of neurons that generate

750
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,980
right foot, left foot,
right foot, left foot

751
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,080
kind of movement.

752
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,620
However, when you decide to move

753
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,200
in a particular deliberate way

754
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,270
that requires a little more attention

755
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,151
you start to engage areas of your brain

756
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,910
for top-down processing

757
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,660
where your forebrain
works from the top down

758
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,630
to control those central
pattern generators

759
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,220
so that maybe it's right foot, right foot,

760
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,167
left foot, right foot,
right foot, left foot

761
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,170
if maybe you're hiking along
some rocks or something.

762
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,590
And you have to engage
in that kind of movement.

763
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,030
So movement, just like thoughts,

764
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,470
can be either reflexive or deliberate.

765
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,030
And when we talk about deliberate

766
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,070
I want to be very specific
about how your brain works

767
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,903
in a deliberate way

768
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,490
because it gives rise to
a very important feature

769
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,280
of the nervous system that
we're going to talk about next,

770
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,010
which is your ability to
change your nervous system.

771
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,210
And what I'd like to
center on for a second

772
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,100
is this notion of what does it mean

773
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,110
for the nervous system to
do something deliberately?

774
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,520
Well, when you do something deliberately,

775
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,710
you pay attention, you are
bringing your perception

776
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,500
to an analysis of three things,

777
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,740
duration, how long something
is is going to take

778
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,200
or should be done,

779
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,260
path, what you should be doing,

780
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,300
and outcome, if you do something

781
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,640
for a given length of time,
what's going to happen.

782
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,570
Now when you're walking down
the street or you're eating

783
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,170
or you're just talking
reflexively, you're not doing this

784
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,750
what I call DPO, duration, path, outcome,

785
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,450
type of deliberate function

786
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,330
in your brain and nervous system.

787
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,090
But the moment you
decide to learn something

788
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,110
or to resist speaking

789
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,450
or to speak up when you
would rather be quiet,

790
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,120
anytime you're deliberately

791
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,720
kind of forcing yourself over a threshold,

792
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,590
you're engaging these brain circuits

793
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,400
and these nervous system circuits

794
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,170
that suddenly make it feel as
if something is challenging.

795
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,650
Something has changed.

796
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,750
Well, what's changed?

797
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,870
What's changed is that when you engage

798
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,530
in this duration, path, and outcome

799
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,970
type of thinking or
behavior or way of being

800
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,070
you start to recruit these neuromodulators

801
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,370
that are released from
particular areas of your brain,

802
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,940
and also it turns out from your body.

803
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,280
and they start cuing
to your nervous system.

804
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,130
Something's different.

805
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,330
Something's different
now about what I'm doing.

806
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,420
Something's different
about what I'm feeling.

807
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,970
Let's give an example where perhaps

808
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,190
somebody says something
that's triggering to you.

809
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,240
You don't like it.

810
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,360
And you know you shouldn't respond.

811
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,030
You feel like, oh, I shouldn't respond,

812
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,420
I shouldn't respond, I shouldn't respond.

813
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,870
You're actively suppressing your behavior

814
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,670
through top down processing.

815
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,620
Your forebrain is actually preventing you

816
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,370
from saying the thing that
you know you shouldn't say

817
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,810
or that maybe you should wait to say

818
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,590
or say in a different form.

819
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,810
This feels like agitation and stress

820
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,150
because you're actually
suppressing a circuit.

821
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,620
We actually can see examples

822
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,130
of what happens when
you're not doing this well.

823
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,000
Some of the examples come from children.

824
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,470
If you look at young children

825
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,602
they don't have the forebrain circuitry

826
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,940
to engage in this top down processing

827
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,360
until they reach age 22, even 25.

828
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,950
But in young children, you see
this in a really robust way.

829
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,750
You'll see they'll be
rocking back and forth.

830
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,050
It's hard for them to sit still

831
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,989
because those central pattern generators

832
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,439
are constantly going in the background.

833
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,449
Whereas adults can sit still.

834
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,679
A kid sees a piece of candy that it wants

835
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,709
and will just reach out and grab it.

836
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,620
Whereas an adult probably would ask

837
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,453
if they could have a piece

838
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:25,620
or wait until they were
offered a piece in most cases.

839
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,020
People that have damage
to the certain areas

840
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,150
of the frontal lobes don't
have this kind of restriction.

841
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,620
They'll just blurt things out.

842
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,520
They'll just say things.

843
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,020
We all know people like this.

844
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,000
Impulsivity is a lack of top down control,

845
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,170
a lack of top-down processing.

846
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,190
The other thing that will
turn off the forebrain

847
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,300
and make it harder to top-down processing

848
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,600
is a couple of drinks containing alcohol.

849
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,239
The removal of inhibition is actually

850
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,619
removal of neural inhibition,

851
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,120
of nerve cells suppressing the activity

852
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,490
of other nerve cells.

853
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,350
And so when you look at people

854
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,140
that have damage to their frontal lobes

855
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,130
or you look at puppies or
you look at young children,

856
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,450
everything's a stimulus.

857
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,460
Everything is a potential
interaction for them.

858
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,890
And they have a very hard time

859
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,560
restricting their
behavior and their speech.

860
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,330
So a lot of the motor system
is designed to just work

861
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,860
in a reflexive way.

862
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,790
And then when we decide
we want to learn something

863
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,210
or do something or not do something,

864
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,720
we have to engage in this
top-down restriction.

865
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,260
And it feels like agitation
because it's accompanied

866
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,120
by the release of a neuromodulator
called norepinephrine,

867
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,110
which in the body we call adrenaline.

868
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,360
And it actually makes us feel agitated.

869
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,655
So for those of you that are
trying to learn something new

870
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:39,160
or to learn to suppress your responses

871
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,541
or be more deliberate and
careful in your responses,

872
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:46,510
that is going to feel challenging
for a particular reason.

873
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,580
It's going to feel challenging

874
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,900
because the chemicals in
your body that are released

875
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,440
in association with that effort

876
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,670
are designed to make you
feel kind of agitated.

877
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,650
That low-level tremor
that sometimes people feel

878
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,100
when they're really, really angry

879
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,440
is actually a chemically
induced low-level tremor.

880
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,950
And it's the, what I call limbic friction.

881
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,900
There's an area of your brain

882
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,600
that's involved in our more
primitive reflexive responses

883
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,010
called the limbic system.

884
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,790
And the frontal cortex is in a friction,

885
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,050
it's in a tug of war with
that system all the time.

886
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,300
Unless of course you have
damage to the frontal lobe

887
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,830
or you've had too much
to drink or something.

888
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,360
In which case you tend to
just say and do whatever.

889
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,510
And so this is really
important to understand

890
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,770
because if you want to
understand neuroplasticity,

891
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,790
you want to understand how
to shape your behavior,

892
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,880
how to shape your thinking,

893
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,750
how to change how you're able
to perform in any context,

894
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,640
the most important thing to understand

895
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,790
is that it requires top-down processing.

896
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,800
It requires this feeling of agitation.

897
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,300
In fact, I would say
the agitation and strain

898
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,290
is the entry point to neuroplasticity.

899
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,960
So let's take a look at
what neuroplasticity is.

900
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,060
Let's explore it, not as the
way it's normally talked about

901
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,810
in modern culture,

902
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,900
neuroplasticity, plasticity is great.

903
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,070
Well, what exactly do people mean?

904
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,070
Plasticity itself is just a process

905
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,477
by which neurons can
change their connections

906
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:07,790
and the way they work

907
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,770
so that you can go from things

908
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,530
being very challenging and deliberate,

909
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,520
requiring a lot of effort and strain,

910
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,050
to them being reflexive.

911
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,850
And typically when we
hear about plasticity,

912
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,960
we're thinking about positive

913
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,410
or what I call adaptive plasticity.

914
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,030
A lot of plasticity can be induced,

915
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,490
for instance by brain damage,

916
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,470
but that's generally not

917
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,190
the kind of plasticity that we want.

918
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,890
So when I say plasticity,
unless I say otherwise

919
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,710
I mean adaptive plasticity.

920
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,220
And in particular

921
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,520
most of the neuroplasticity
that people want

922
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,640
is self-directed plasticity.

923
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,460
Because if there's one
truism to neuroplasticity,

924
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,720
it's that from birth until about age 25

925
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,680
the brain is incredibly plastic.

926
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,700
Kids are learning all sorts of things

927
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,430
but they can learn it passively.

928
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,840
They don't have to work
too hard or focus too hard,

929
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,760
although focus helps, to learn new things,

930
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,150
acquire new languages, acquire new skills.

931
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,120
But if you're an adult

932
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,820
and you want to change your
neural circuitry at the level

933
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,390
of emotions or behavior or
thoughts or anything really,

934
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,320
you absolutely need to ask
two important questions.

935
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,480
One, what particular aspect

936
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,410
of my nervous system
am I trying to change?

937
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,480
Meaning, am I trying to change my emotions

938
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,520
or my perceptions, my sensations?

939
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,860
And which ones are
available for me to change?

940
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,650
And then the second question is

941
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,290
how are you going to go about that?

942
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,890
What is the structure

943
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,380
of a regimen to engage neuroplasticity?

944
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,420
And it turns out that the
answer to that second question

945
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,130
is governed by how awake
or how sleepy we are.

946
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,650
So let's talk about that next.

947
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,210
Neuroplasticity is the ability

948
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,480
for these connections
in the brain and body

949
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,563
to change in response to experience.

950
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:49,257
And what's so incredible

951
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:51,060
about the human nervous
system in particular

952
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,140
is that we can direct
our own neural changes.

953
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,460
We can decide that we
want to change our brain.

954
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,570
In other words, our
brain can change itself

955
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,440
and our nervous system can change itself.

956
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,310
And the same can't be said
for other organs of the body.

957
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,190
Even though our other organs of the body

958
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,050
have some ability to change,
they can't direct it.

959
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,780
They can't think and decide,

960
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,850
you know your gut doesn't say,

961
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,990
oh, you know, I want to be able

962
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,540
to digest spicy foods better

963
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,520
so I'm going to rearrange the connections

964
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,390
to be able to do that.

965
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,160
Whereas your brain can decide

966
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,700
that you want to learn a language

967
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,070
or you want to be less
emotionally reactive

968
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,780
or more emotionally engaged,

969
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,080
and you can undergo a series of steps

970
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,070
that will allow your brain
to make those changes

971
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,210
so that eventually it becomes
reflexive for you to do that,

972
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,093
which is absolutely incredible.

973
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,464
For a long time it was
thought that neuroplasticity

974
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:43,410
was the unique gift of
young animals and humans,

975
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,160
that it could only occur when we're young.

976
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,160
And in fact, a young brain
is incredibly plastic.

977
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,960
Children can learn three languages

978
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,160
without an accent reflexively,

979
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,800
whereas adults, it's very challenging.

980
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,480
It takes a lot more effort and strain,

981
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,200
a lot more of that duration,
path, outcome kind of thinking

982
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,239
in order to achieve those plastic changes.

983
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,410
We now know, however, that
the adult brain can change

984
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,250
in response to experience.

985
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,850
Nobel prizes were given

986
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,730
for the understanding that the young brain

987
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,420
can change very dramatically.

988
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,664
I think one of the most
extreme examples would be

989
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,010
for people that are born blind from birth

990
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,500
they use the area of their brain

991
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,780
that normally would be used

992
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,150
for visualizing objects and colors

993
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,220
and things outside of
them for braille reading.

994
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,260
In brain imaging studies it's
been shown that, you know,

995
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,460
people who are blind from
birth, when they braille read,

996
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,293
the area of the brain

997
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:39,293
that would normally light
up, if you will, for vision

998
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,000
lights up for braille reading.

999
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,590
So that real estate is reallocated

1000
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,343
for an entirely different function.

1001
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,610
If someone is made blind in adulthood,

1002
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,130
it's unlikely that their
entire visual brain

1003
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,590
will be taken over

1004
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,890
by the areas of the brain that
are responsible for touch.

1005
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,220
However, there's some evidence
that areas of the brain

1006
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,610
that are involved in hearing and touch

1007
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,180
can kind of migrate into that area.

1008
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,540
And there's a lot of interest
now in trying to figure out

1009
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,120
how more plasticity can
be induced in adulthood,

1010
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,400
more positive plasticity.

1011
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,670
And in order to understand that process

1012
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,580
we really have to understand something

1013
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,420
that might at first

1014
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,920
seem totally divorced
from neuroplasticity,

1015
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,950
but actually lies at the
center of neuroplasticity.

1016
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,460
And for any of you that are interested

1017
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,070
in changing your nervous system

1018
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,470
so that something that you want can go

1019
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,410
from being very hard or
seem almost impossible

1020
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,940
and out of reach to being very reflexive,

1021
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,713
this is especially important
to pay attention to.

1022
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,430
Plasticity in the adult human
nervous system is gated,

1023
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,670
meaning it is controlled
by neuromodulators.

1024
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,630
These things that we talked about earlier,

1025
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,258
dopamine, serotonin,

1026
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,373
and one in particular
called acetylcholine,

1027
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,960
are what open up plasticity.

1028
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,240
They literally unveil plasticity

1029
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,670
and allow brief periods of time

1030
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,750
in which whatever information,

1031
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,200
whatever thing we're sensing
or perceiving or thinking,

1032
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,060
whatever emotions we feel

1033
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,300
can literally be mapped in the brain

1034
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,280
such that later it will become much easier

1035
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,960
for us to experience and feel that thing.

1036
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Now, this has a dark
side and a positive side.

1037
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,280
The dark side is it's actually very easy

1038
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,570
to get neuroplasticity as an adult

1039
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,440
through traumatic or terrible
or challenging experiences.

1040
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,770
But the important question
is to say, why is that?

1041
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,460
And the reason that's the case is because

1042
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,320
when something very bad
happens, there's the release

1043
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,660
of two sets of
neuromodulators in the brain,

1044
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,290
epinephrine which tends to make
us feel alert and agitated,

1045
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,200
which is associated with
most bad circumstances.

1046
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,830
And acetylcholine, which tends to create

1047
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,100
a even more intense and
focused perceptual spotlight.

1048
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,895
Remember earlier we were
talking about perception

1049
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,860
and how it's kind of like a spotlight.

1050
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,530
Acetylcholine makes that
light particularly bright

1051
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:06,130
and particularly restricted to
one region of our experience.

1052
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,630
And it does that by making certain neurons

1053
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,336
in our brain and body

1054
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:14,720
active much more than all the rest.

1055
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,230
So acetylcholine is sorta
like a highlighter marker

1056
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,180
upon which neuroplasticity
then comes in later and says,

1057
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,860
wait, which neurons were active

1058
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,800
in this particularly alerting
phase of whatever, you know,

1059
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,830
day or night, whenever
this thing happened.

1060
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,670
So the way it works is this,
you can think of epinephrine

1061
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,127
as creating this alertness

1062
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:39,020
and this kind of unbelievable
level of increased attention

1063
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,710
compared to what you
were experiencing before.

1064
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,580
And you can think of acetylcholine

1065
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,710
as being the molecule that
highlights whatever happens

1066
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,480
during that period of
heightened alertness.

1067
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,110
So just to be clear,

1068
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,800
it's epinephrine creates the alertness,

1069
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,870
that's coming from a subset
of neurons in the brain stem

1070
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,970
if you're interested,

1071
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,228
and acetylcholine coming
from an area of the forebrain

1072
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:04,640
is tagging or marking the neurons

1073
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,040
that are particularly active

1074
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,990
during this heightened level of alertness.

1075
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,190
Now that marks the cells,
the neurons and the synapses

1076
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,540
for strengthening,

1077
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,600
for becoming more likely
to be active in the future

1078
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,080
even without us thinking about it.

1079
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,567
Okay?

1080
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:24,340
So in bad circumstances

1081
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,640
this all happens without
us having to do much.

1082
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,090
When we want something to happen, however,

1083
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,220
we want to learn a language,
we want to learn a new skill,

1084
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,390
we want to become more motivated,

1085
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,580
what do we know for certain?

1086
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,370
We know that that process
of getting neuroplasticity

1087
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,540
so that we have more
focus, more motivation,

1088
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,780
absolutely requires the
release of epinephrine.

1089
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,130
We have to have alertness
in order to have focus

1090
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,920
and we have to have focus

1091
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,830
in order to direct those plastic changes

1092
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,710
to particular parts of our nervous system.

1093
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,291
Now, this has immense implications

1094
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:03,230
in thinking about the various tools,

1095
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,520
whether or not those are
chemical tools or machine tools

1096
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,970
or just self-induced regimens

1097
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,840
of how long or how intensely
you're going to focus

1098
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,903
in order to get neuroplasticity.

1099
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,210
But there's another side to it.

1100
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,970
The dirty secret of neuroplasticity

1101
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,630
is that no neuroplasticity occurs

1102
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,810
during the thing you're trying to learn,

1103
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,630
during the terrible event,
during the great event.

1104
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,470
During the thing

1105
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:32,510
that you're really trying
to shape and learn,

1106
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:35,710
nothing is actually
changing between the neurons

1107
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,210
that is going to last.

1108
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,640
All the neuroplasticity, the
strengthening of the synapses,

1109
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,660
the addition, in some
cases, of new nerve cells

1110
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,490
or at least connections
between nerve cells,

1111
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,940
all of that occurs at a
very different phase of life

1112
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,880
which is when we are in sleep
and non-sleep deep rest.

1113
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,330
And so neuroplasticity,

1114
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,480
which is the kind of Holy
Grail of human experience of,

1115
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,490
you know, this is the New Year

1116
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,320
and everyone's thinking
New Year's resolutions.

1117
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,950
And right now, perhaps
everything's organized

1118
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,440
and people are highly motivated

1119
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,200
but what happens in March or April or May?

1120
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,737
Well, that all depends
on how much attention

1121
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:14,230
and focus one can continually bring

1122
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,100
to whatever it is they're trying to learn,

1123
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,350
so much so that agitation
and a feeling of strain

1124
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,980
are actually required

1125
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,690
for this process of
neuro-plasticity to get triggered.

1126
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,270
But the actual rewiring occurs

1127
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,690
during periods of sleep
and non-sleep deep rest.

1128
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,060
There's a study published last year

1129
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,310
that's particularly relevant
here that I want to share,

1130
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,350
it was not done by my laboratory,

1131
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,320
that showed that 20 minutes of deep rest,

1132
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,970
this is not deep sleep,

1133
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,890
but essentially doing something
very hard and very intense

1134
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,540
and then taking 20 minutes
immediately afterwards

1135
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,350
to deliberately turn off

1136
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,730
the deliberate focused
thinking and engagement

1137
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,510
actually accelerated neuroplasticity.

1138
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,710
There's another study
that's just incredible.

1139
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,760
And we're going to go into this

1140
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,210
in a future episode of the
podcast not too long from now,

1141
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:10,210
that showed that if people are
learning a particular skill,

1142
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,840
it could be a language
skill or a motor skill,

1143
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,380
and they hear a tone just
playing in the background,

1144
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,560
and the tone is playing
periodically in the background,

1145
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,510
like just a bell.

1146
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,740
In deep sleep, if that bell is played

1147
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,730
learning is much faster for the thing

1148
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,240
that they were learning
while they were awake.

1149
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,850
It somehow cues the
nervous system in sleep,

1150
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,590
doesn't even have to be in dreaming,

1151
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,050
that something that
happened in the waking phase

1152
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,540
was especially important.

1153
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,630
So much so that that bell
is sort of a Pavlovian cue,

1154
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,350
it's sort of a reminder
to the sleeping brain,

1155
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,950
oh, you need to remember what it is

1156
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,730
that you were learning at
that particular time of day.

1157
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,860
And the learning rates and
the rates of retention,

1158
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,260
meaning how much people can remember

1159
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,450
from the thing they learned,

1160
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,860
are significantly higher
under those conditions.

1161
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,714
So I'm going to talk about how
to apply all this knowledge

1162
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:04,150
a little bit more in this podcast episode

1163
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,970
but also in future episodes.

1164
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,826
But it really speaks to
the really key importance

1165
00:48:09,826 --> 00:48:12,630
of sleep and focus,

1166
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,800
these two opposite ends
of our attentional state.

1167
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,810
When we're in sleep these DPOs,

1168
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,430
duration, path, and outcome
analysis are impossible.

1169
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,820
We just can't do that.

1170
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,460
We are only in relation to
what's happening inside of us.

1171
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,420
So sleep is key.

1172
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,120
Also key are periods
of non-sleep deep rest

1173
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,000
where we're turning off our analysis

1174
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,593
of duration, path, and outcome,

1175
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:35,990
in particular for the thing

1176
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,170
that we were just trying to learn.

1177
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,290
And we're in this kind of liminal state

1178
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,500
where our attention is
kind of drifting all over.

1179
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,970
It turns out that's very important

1180
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,950
for the consolidation, for the changes

1181
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,053
between the nerve cells that will allow

1182
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:49,980
what we were trying to learn to go

1183
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,000
from being deliberate and hard
and stressful and a strain

1184
00:48:55,052 --> 00:48:57,303
to easy and reflexive.

1185
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,270
This also points to how different people,

1186
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,160
including many modern clinicians,

1187
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,670
are thinking about how to prevent

1188
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,660
bad circumstances, traumas,

1189
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,320
from routing their way into
our nervous system permanently.

1190
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,999
It says that you might want to interfere

1191
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:14,240
with certain aspects of brain states

1192
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,580
that are away from the
bad thing that happened,

1193
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,600
the brain states that
happened the next day

1194
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,810
or the next month or the next year.

1195
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,790
And also, I want to make sure

1196
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:27,260
that I pay attention to the
fact that for many of you

1197
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,650
you're thinking about neuro-plasticity

1198
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,920
not just in changing your nervous system

1199
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,420
to add something new

1200
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,910
but to also get rid of things
that you don't like, right?

1201
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,130
That you want to forget bad experiences

1202
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,540
or at least remove the
emotional contingency

1203
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,970
of a bad relationship

1204
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,020
or a bad relationship to some thing

1205
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,820
or some person or some event.

1206
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,000
Learning to fear certain things,
less to eliminate a phobia,

1207
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,790
to erase a trauma.

1208
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,010
The memories themselves don't get erased.

1209
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,600
I'm sorry to say

1210
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,800
that the memories don't
themselves get erased,

1211
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,680
but the emotional load of
memories can be reduced.

1212
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,950
And there are a number of different ways

1213
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,220
that that can happen

1214
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,670
but they all require this thing

1215
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,550
that we're calling neuroplasticity.

1216
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,960
We're going to have a
large number of discussions

1217
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,060
about neuroplasticity in depth,

1218
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,480
but the most important thing to understand

1219
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,460
is that it is indeed a two phase process.

1220
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,280
What governs the transition
between alert and focused

1221
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,840
and these deep rest and deep sleep states

1222
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,280
is a system in our brain and body,

1223
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,880
a certain aspect of the nervous system

1224
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,640
called the autonomic nervous system.

1225
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,850
And it is immensely
important to understand

1226
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,310
how this autonomic nervous system works.

1227
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,450
It has names like the
sympathetic nervous system

1228
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,770
and parasympathetic nervous system

1229
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,450
which frankly are complicated names

1230
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,790
because they're a little bit misleading.

1231
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,610
Sympathetic is the one that's associated

1232
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,450
with more alertness.

1233
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,130
Parasympathetic is the
one that's associated

1234
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,790
with more calmness.

1235
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,140
And it gets really misleading

1236
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,380
because the sympathetic nervous
system sounds like sympathy.

1237
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,910
And then people think
it's related to calm.

1238
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,480
I'm going to call it the alertness system

1239
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,230
and the calmness system,

1240
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:02,730
because even though
sympathetic and parasympathetic

1241
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,420
are sometimes used, people
really get confused.

1242
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,730
So the way to think about
the autonomic nervous system

1243
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,980
and the reason it's important
for every aspect of your life,

1244
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,940
but in particular for neuroplasticity

1245
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,857
and engaging in these focus states

1246
00:51:15,857 --> 00:51:17,650
and in these de-focused states

1247
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,910
is that it works sort of like a seesaw.

1248
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,030
Every 24 hours, we're all
familiar with the fact

1249
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,230
that when we wake up in the morning

1250
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,350
we might be a little bit groggy

1251
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,990
but then generally we're more alert.

1252
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,180
And then as evening comes around

1253
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,300
we tend to become a little
more relaxed and sleepy.

1254
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,690
Eventually at some point
at night, we go to sleep.

1255
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,920
So we go from alert to deeply calm.

1256
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,430
And as we do that, we go
from an ability to engage

1257
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,322
in these very focused
duration, path, outcome

1258
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:44,155
types of analyses

1259
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:46,830
to states in sleep that
are completely divorced

1260
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,520
from duration, path, and outcome

1261
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,880
in which everything is
completely random and untethered

1262
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,160
in terms of our sensations,
perceptions and feelings

1263
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,090
and so forth.

1264
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,226
So every 24 hours, we
have a phase of our day

1265
00:51:57,226 --> 00:52:02,226
that is optimal for thinking
and focusing and learning

1266
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,800
and neuroplasticity and
doing all sorts of things.

1267
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,540
We have energy as well.

1268
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,940
And at another phase of our day

1269
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,400
we're tired and we have
no ability to focus.

1270
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,700
We have no ability

1271
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,860
to engage in duration, path,
outcome types of analyses.

1272
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,970
And it's interesting that
both phases are important

1273
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,650
for shaping our nervous system
in the ways that we want.

1274
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,620
So if we want to engage neuroplasticity

1275
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,300
and we want to get the most
out of our nervous system

1276
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,831
we each have to master

1277
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:32,850
both the transition between
wakefulness and sleep

1278
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,510
and the transition between
sleep and wakefulness.

1279
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,940
Now so much has been made
of the importance of sleep.

1280
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,320
And it is critically important

1281
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,090
for wound healing, for
learning as I just mentioned,

1282
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,060
for consolidating learning,

1283
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,370
for all aspects of our immune system.

1284
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:48,540
It is the one period of time

1285
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,373
in which we're not doing

1286
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:51,760
these duration, path, and
outcome types of analyses.

1287
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,920
And it is critically important

1288
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,620
to all aspects of our health,
including our longevity.

1289
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,140
Much less has been made, however,

1290
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,830
of how to get better at sleeping,

1291
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,810
how to get better at the process

1292
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,680
that involves falling
asleep, staying asleep,

1293
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,090
and accessing the states of mind and body

1294
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,770
that involve total paralysis.

1295
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,603
Most people don't know this

1296
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:14,930
but you're actually paralyzed
during much of your sleep

1297
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,570
so that you can't act out
your dreams, presumably.

1298
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,870
But also where your brain
is in a total idle state

1299
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,030
where it's not controlling anything,

1300
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,103
it's just left to kind of free run.

1301
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,910
And there are certain
things that we can all do

1302
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,430
in order to master that transition,

1303
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,380
in order to get better at sleeping.

1304
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,710
And it involves much more
than just how much we sleep.

1305
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,430
We're all being told, of course,
that we need to sleep more

1306
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,810
but there's also the
issue of sleep quality,

1307
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,330
accessing those deep
States of non DPO thinking.

1308
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,140
Accessing the right timing of sleep,

1309
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,670
not a lot has been discussed
publicly, as far as I'm aware,

1310
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,610
of when to time your sleep.

1311
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,480
I think we all can appreciate

1312
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,890
that sleeping for half an
hour throughout the day

1313
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,565
so that you get a total
of eight hours of sleep

1314
00:54:00,565 --> 00:54:02,420
every 24 hour cycle

1315
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,050
is probably very different and not optimal

1316
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,380
compared to a solid block
of eight hours of sleep.

1317
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,940
Although there are people
that have tried this,

1318
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,850
I think it's been written
about in various books.

1319
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,500
Not many people can
stick to that schedule.

1320
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,610
Incidentally, I think it's
called the Uberman schedule,

1321
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:19,070
not to be confused with
the Huberman schedule

1322
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:19,903
because first of all

1323
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,310
my schedule doesn't
look anything like that.

1324
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,143
And second of all

1325
00:54:22,143 --> 00:54:24,533
I would never attempt
such a sleeping regime.

1326
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,406
The other thing that is
really important to understand

1327
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:32,870
is that we have not
explored, as a culture,

1328
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,880
the rhythms that occur
in our waking states.

1329
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,280
So much has been focused
on the value of sleep

1330
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,470
and the importance of
sleep, which is great.

1331
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,970
But I don't think that most
people are paying attention

1332
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,780
to what's happening in their waking states

1333
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,540
and when their brain
is optimized for focus,

1334
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,840
when their brain is optimized

1335
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,240
for these DPOs, these
duration, path, outcome

1336
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,230
types of engagements for
learning and for changing

1337
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,360
and when are their brain
is probably better suited

1338
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,560
for more reflexive thinking and behaviors.

1339
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,880
And it turns out

1340
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,820
that there's a vast
amount of scientific data

1341
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,400
which points to the existence

1342
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,500
of what are called ultradian rhythms.

1343
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,800
You may have heard of circadian rhythms.

1344
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,690
Circadian means, circa, about a day.

1345
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,664
So it's 24 hour rhythms

1346
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:18,140
because the earth spins
once every 24 hours.

1347
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,284
Ultradian rhythms occur throughout the day

1348
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,680
and they require less
time, they're shorter.

1349
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,170
The most important ultradian rhythm

1350
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,370
for sake of this discussion

1351
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,650
is the 90 minute rhythm
that we're going through

1352
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:34,030
all the time in our ability
to attend and focus.

1353
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,440
And in sleep, we are,
our sleep is broken up

1354
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,540
into 90 minute segments.

1355
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,373
Early in the night

1356
00:55:40,373 --> 00:55:42,990
we have more phase one and
phase two lighter sleep.

1357
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:43,823
And then we go into

1358
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:45,390
our deeper phase three
and phase four sleep.

1359
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,560
And then we return to phase
one, two, three, four.

1360
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,530
So all night, you're going

1361
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,220
through these ultradian rhythms

1362
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,560
of stage one, two, three, four,

1363
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,970
one, two, three, four, it's repeating.

1364
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,040
Most people perhaps know that.

1365
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,873
Maybe they don't.

1366
00:55:57,873 --> 00:56:00,160
But you wake up in the morning,

1367
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,340
these ultradian rhythms continue.

1368
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,530
And it turns out that we are optimized

1369
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,540
for focus and attention
within these 90 minute cycles

1370
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,840
so that at the beginning of
one of these 90 minute cycles

1371
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,500
maybe you sit down to learn something new

1372
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,740
or to engage in some new
challenging behavior,

1373
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,210
for the first five or 10
minutes of one of those cycles

1374
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,850
it's well-known that the
brain and the neural circuits

1375
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:24,880
and the neuromodulators are
not going to be optimally tuned

1376
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,120
to whatever it is you're trying to do.

1377
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,600
But as you drop deeper
into that 90 minute cycle

1378
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,270
your ability to focus and to
engage in this DPO process

1379
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,320
and to direct neuroplasticity and to learn

1380
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,740
is actually much greater.

1381
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,220
And then you eventually pop out of that

1382
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,100
at the end of the 90 minute cycle.

1383
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,160
So these cycles are occurring in sleep

1384
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,330
and these cycles are
occurring in wakefulness.

1385
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,080
And all of those are governed

1386
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,350
by this seesaw of alertness to calmness

1387
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,660
that we call the autonomic nervous system.

1388
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,380
So if you want to master and
control your nervous system,

1389
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,430
regardless of what tool you reach to,

1390
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,070
whether or not it's a pharmacologic tool

1391
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,670
or whether or not it's a behavioral tool

1392
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,010
or whether or not it's a
brain machine interface tool,

1393
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,610
it's vitally important to understand

1394
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:09,600
that your entire existence is occurring

1395
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,180
in these 90 minute cycles,

1396
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,040
whether or not you're asleep or awake.

1397
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,010
And so you really need to
learn how to wedge into

1398
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:17,660
those 90 minute cycles.

1399
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,930
And for instance, it
would be completely crazy

1400
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:21,850
and counterproductive

1401
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,930
to try and just learn
information while in deep sleep

1402
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,330
by listening to that information

1403
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:28,470
because you're not able to access it.

1404
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,820
It would be perfectly good,

1405
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:34,240
however, to engage in a focused
bout of learning each day.

1406
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,460
And now we know how long

1407
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,160
that focused bout of learning should be,

1408
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,400
it should be at least one 90 minute cycle.

1409
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,150
And the expectation should
be that the early phase

1410
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,310
of that cycle is going to be challenging.

1411
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,143
It's going to hurt.

1412
00:57:45,143 --> 00:57:46,330
It's not going to feel natural.

1413
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,220
It's not going to feel like flow.

1414
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,616
But that you can learn

1415
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:51,930
and the circuits of your
brain that are involved

1416
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,190
in focus and motivation

1417
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:56,810
can learn to drop into
a mode of more focus,

1418
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,400
get more neuroplasticity in other words,

1419
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,120
by engaging these ultradian cycles

1420
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,350
at the appropriate times of day.

1421
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,530
For instance, some people
are very good learners

1422
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,120
early in the day and not
so good in the afternoon.

1423
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,880
So you can start to explore this process

1424
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,670
even without any information

1425
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:15,100
about the underlying neurochemicals

1426
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,910
by simply paying attention,

1427
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,340
not just to when you go to sleep

1428
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,380
and when you wake up each morning,

1429
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,060
how deep or how shallow your
sleep felt to you subjectively.

1430
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,340
But also, throughout the day,

1431
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,480
when your brain tends to be most anxious.

1432
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,870
Because it turns out that has a correlate

1433
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,850
related to perception
that we will talk about.

1434
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,010
You can ask yourself

1435
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,220
when are you most focused?

1436
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,390
When are you least anxious?

1437
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,040
When do you feel most motivated?

1438
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,950
When do you feel least motivated?

1439
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,690
By understanding how the different aspects

1440
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,520
of your perception, sensation, feeling,

1441
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,960
thought, and actions,

1442
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,490
tend to want to be engaged
or not want to be engaged.

1443
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,960
You develop a very good window

1444
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,640
into what's going to be required

1445
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,620
to shift your ability to focus

1446
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,380
or shift your ability to engage
in creative type thinking

1447
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,770
at different times of
day, should you choose.

1448
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:07,900
And so that's where we're
heading, going forward.

1449
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,690
It all starts with mastering this seesaw

1450
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,490
that is the autonomic nervous system,

1451
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,820
that at a course level is a transition

1452
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,300
between wakefulness and
sleep, but at a finer level,

1453
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,550
and just as important,

1454
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,250
are the various cycles, these
ultradian 90 minute cycles

1455
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,250
that govern our life all the time,

1456
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,450
24 hours a day every day of our life.

1457
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,640
And so we're going to talk
about how you can take control

1458
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,110
of the autonomic nervous system

1459
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:33,130
so that you can better
access neuroplasticity,

1460
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,810
better access sleep,

1461
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,710
even take advantage of the phase

1462
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,920
that is the transition
between sleep and waking

1463
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,570
to access things like
creativity and so forth.

1464
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,485
All based on studies
that have been published

1465
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:47,690
over the last 100 years,
mainly within the last 10 years

1466
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,330
and some that are very, very new.

1467
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,510
And that point to the use

1468
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,390
of specific tools that will allow you

1469
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:55,160
to get the most out of
your nervous system.

1470
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,690
So today we covered a lot of information.

1471
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,460
It was sort of a whirlwind tour

1472
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,800
of everything from neurons and synapses

1473
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,490
to neuroplasticity and the
autonomic nervous system.

1474
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:07,250
We will revisit a lot of
these themes going forward.

1475
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,590
So if all of that didn't
sink in in one pass,

1476
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,480
please don't worry.

1477
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,480
We will come back to these
themes over and over again.

1478
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,000
I wanted to equip you with a language

1479
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,520
so that we're all developing

1480
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,240
a kind of common base set of
information going forward.

1481
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,230
And I hope the information
is valuable to you

1482
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:27,350
in your thinking about what
is working well for you

1483
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,410
and what's working less well

1484
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,080
and what's been exceedingly challenging,

1485
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,340
what's been easy for you

1486
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,870
in terms of your pursuit
of particular behaviors

1487
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,280
or emotional states where your challenges

1488
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,720
or the challenges of people
that you know might reside.

1489
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,740
As promised in our welcome video,

1490
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,770
the format of the "Huberman Lab" podcast

1491
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,040
is to dive deep into individual topics

1492
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,100
for an entire month at a time.

1493
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,040
So for the entire month of January

1494
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,220
we're going to explore this
incredible state that is sleep

1495
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:59,040
and a related state, which
is non-sleep deep rest

1496
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,440
and what they do

1497
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,100
for things like learning,
resetting our emotional capacity.

1498
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,510
Everyone's probably familiar with the fact

1499
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,323
that when we're sleep deprived

1500
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:10,990
we're so much less good at
dealing with life circumstances.

1501
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,010
We're more emotionally labile.

1502
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,843
Why is that?

1503
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:14,800
How is that?

1504
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,190
But most importantly,
we're going to talk about

1505
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,710
how to get better at sleeping

1506
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,330
and how to access better sleep

1507
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:24,290
even when your sleep timing
or duration is compromised.

1508
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:27,190
We're also going to talk
about the data that support

1509
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:31,540
this very interesting state
called non-sleep deep rest

1510
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,190
where one is neither asleep nor awake,

1511
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,210
but it turns out one can recover

1512
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,800
some of the neuromodulators

1513
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,840
and more importantly the processes

1514
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,640
involved in sensation, perception,

1515
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,060
feeling, thought, and action.

1516
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,510
It's sure to be a very rich
discussion back and forth

1517
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,470
where I'm answering your
questions and providing tools.

1518
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,380
And I'm certain you're also going to learn

1519
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,320
a lot of information about neuroscience

1520
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,220
and what makes up this
incredible phase of your life

1521
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,690
where you think you're not conscious,

1522
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:02,270
but you're actually resetting
and renewing yourself

1523
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:05,140
in order to perform better,
feel better, et cetera,

1524
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,600
in the waking state.
