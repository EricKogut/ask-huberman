00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,280
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,710
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,044
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:09,430
[upbeat rock music]

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,370
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,870
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,000
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,170
Today, we are talking all
about food and the brain.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,120
We are going to talk about

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,760
foods that are good for your
brain in terms of focus,

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,600
in terms of brain health generally,

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,540
and the longevity of your brain,

13
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,810
your ability to maintain cognition

14
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,050
and clear thinking over time.

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,330
We are also going to talk about why

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,350
and how you prefer
certain foods to others.

17
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,860
And I'm going to talk about
the three major signals

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,840
that combine to drive your food choices.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,190
I'll give you a little
hint of what those are.

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,610
One of those signals comes from your gut

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,910
and is completely subconscious.

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,540
This is not the gut microbiome, per se.

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,960
These are neurons in your gut

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,490
that are sending signals to your brain

25
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,200
that you are unaware of

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,520
about the nutrient contents of
the foods that you're eating.

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,550
The second signal is

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,830
how metabolically
accessible a given food is,

29
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,990
meaning how readily that food

30
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,630
can be converted into
energy that your brain,

31
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,463
not your body,

32
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:13,890
but that your brain can use.

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,230
And the third signal is perhaps
the most interesting one.

34
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,940
It's the signal of belief.

35
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,150
It's the signal of what you perceive

36
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,850
and believe the food that
you're eating to contain,

37
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,550
and what you think it can
do for you health-wise

38
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,980
and energy-wise.

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,220
And that might sound a
little wishy-washy or vague,

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,110
but we're going to
provide mechanistic data

41
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,870
to support the fact that
you can change what you eat

42
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,790
so much so that you can drive your brain

43
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,910
and your body to crave
foods that are good for you,

44
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,760
or at least better for you

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,920
than the foods you might
currently be eating.

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,610
This is an incredibly powerful
mechanism that we all have.

47
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,200
It's one that I think is
very underappreciated.

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,910
And today, I'm going to review the data

49
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,050
from both animal models,

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,980
and fortunately, more
recently, human studies,

51
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,000
that really do underscore the fact

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,400
that you can control your
desire for particular foods.

53
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Before we dive into today's topic,

54
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,620
I just want to briefly touch on

55
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,620
some key takeaways from
a previous episode,

56
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,560
which is the episode on
time restricted feeding,

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,210
also called intermittent fasting.

58
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,480
The key elements of
time restricted feeding

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,970
that will benefit your health the most,

60
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,350
in terms of weight loss or maintenance,

61
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,220
fat loss, organ health,
quality sleep, and cognition,

62
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,280
are that the feeding window begin

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,220
at least one hour after waking.

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,800
You could push that feeding
window out to begin later,

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,437
but at least one hour after waking.

66
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:46,350
And that it end at least two,

67
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,570
and ideally, three hours
before going to sleep.

68
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,980
Some people can end that feeding window

69
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,320
much further away from
the beginning of sleep,

70
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,890
meaning they're finishing
their last bite of food,

71
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,120
for instance, at 6:00 PM,

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,860
and they're not going
to sleep until midnight.

73
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,680
But many people struggle
to get quality sleep

74
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,700
if that feeding window is set too early

75
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,200
relative to when they go to sleep.

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,447
So begin the feeding window at
least one hour after waking.

77
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,670
End the feeding window

78
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,200
at least two hours before going to sleep.

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,230
And a key feature based on
the scientific research,

80
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,500
is that the feeding window itself

81
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,810
fall more or less at the same
period of each 24 hour day

82
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,140
from day to day.

83
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,600
Meaning, if you are going to
eat over an eight hour period,

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,270
that's your feeding window,

85
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,880
you wouldn't want to
start that feeding window

86
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,200
at 10:00 AM one day and end it at 6:00 PM,

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,048
and then the next day, start
at noon and end it at 8:00 PM,

88
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:44,426
and the next day, start it at 2:00 PM

89
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,940
and end it at 10:00 PM, and so forth.

90
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,780
As much as is reasonably possible,

91
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,420
if you want to extract the maximum

92
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,400
benefit from time restricted feeding,

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,690
the idea is to keep
that feeding window at,

94
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,380
more or less, the same
phase, as it's called,

95
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,270
of each 24 hour day.

96
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,620
If it slides around a little
bit for social reasons

97
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,920
or whatever reasons,

98
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,570
it doesn't seem to be a big deal,

99
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,640
but you don't want it sliding around

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,830
by many hours from day to day,

101
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,830
because of the way that
that feeding window

102
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,080
impacts other genes called clock genes

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,390
that regulate a bunch of
other processes in the body.

104
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,399
Before we begin,

105
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,199
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

106
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,280
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

107
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,970
It is, however, part of my desire

108
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,650
and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information

109
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,870
about science and science related tools

110
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,360
to the general public.

111
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,790
In keeping with that theme,

112
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,820
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

113
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,030
Our first sponsor is ROKA.

114
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,280
ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses that are

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,950
of the absolute highest quality.

116
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,500
I've spent a career working
on the visual system,

117
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,100
and one of the key problems

118
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,200
that ROKA sunglasses has solved is,

119
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,470
if you've ever worn sunglasses,

120
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,790
and you've gone from a
very bright region to, say,

121
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,030
a region with shadows,

122
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,380
oftentimes, you have to
take the sunglasses off.

123
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,140
They've designed their
sunglasses in a way,

124
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,890
that no matter whether
you're standing in the shade

125
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,030
or in bright sunlight,

126
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,100
you always see things with
absolute crystal clarity,

127
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,220
which is wonderful.

128
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,340
Their eyeglasses as well are designed

129
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,173
so that you can move from

130
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:12,840
one region of brightness to another

131
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,550
without noticing it at all.

132
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,940
The other thing that's really terrific

133
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,820
about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,

134
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,270
is that they are very lightweight.

135
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,103
Most of the time,

136
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,740
you don't even remember
that they're on your face.

137
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,910
And you can wear them

138
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,540
whether or not you're
exercising or working,

139
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,253
because they won't slip
off, even if you get sweaty.

140
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,880
The other thing that's really wonderful,

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,670
is that the aesthetic is terrific.

142
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,590
Unlike a lot of so-called
performance glasses out there

143
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,340
that make people look like cyborgs,

144
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,530
or frankly, just look rather strange,

145
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,410
ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
have a terrific aesthetic.

146
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,950
You could wear them to dinner,
to work, running, exercising,

147
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,180
and they'll work for all those situations.

148
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,470
If you'd like to try ROKA,

149
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,260
you can go to ROKA.com.

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,710
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

153
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,750
Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink

154
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,170
that's designed to cover your
foundational supplementation

155
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,530
and health needs.

156
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,950
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012,

157
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,580
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

158
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,360
The reason I started
using Athletic Greens,

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,420
and the reason I still drink

160
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,640
Athletic Greens once or twice per day,

161
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,240
is because it covers all of my
vitamin mineral basic needs,

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,380
and because of the probiotics.

163
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,320
There's now ample data supporting the fact

164
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,110
that probiotics support
a healthy gut microbiome,

165
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,310
and that the gut microbiome is important

166
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,660
for keeping inflammation
low, which is good,

167
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,630
as well as for supporting
the immune system,

168
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,360
and for supporting brain health

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,760
through the so-called gut brain access.

170
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,270
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

171
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,210
you can go to Athleticgreens.com/Huberman.

172
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,650
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

173
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,330
They'll give you five free travel packs.

174
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,770
So these packs make it really
easy to mix up Athletic Greens

175
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,050
when you're on the road,
in the car, et cetera.

176
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,800
And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3/K2.

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,039
There's now a lot of
data pointing to the fact

178
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,230
that vitamin D3 and K2 are
important for hormonal health,

179
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,910
for cardiovascular function.

180
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,880
And so if you go to
Athleticgreens.com/Huberman,

181
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,070
you'll get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs,

182
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,230
and a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.

183
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,490
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

184
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,130
Headspace is a meditation app

185
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,790
backed by 25 peer-reviewed
published studies.

186
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,080
I think by now, most people have heard

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,040
of the benefits of meditation.

188
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,050
Reduce stress, improves sleep,
better cognition, et cetera.

189
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,040
I've been meditating for a long time,

190
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,970
but I have to admit,

191
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,450
it's been sort of an on and off thing.

192
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,910
There are periods of
time over the last 10,

193
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,970
or gosh, even 20 or 30 years,

194
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,580
that I've meditated consistently,

195
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,260
and then I'll stop meditating.

196
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,980
One of the terrific things about Headspace

197
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,190
is that it has meditations
of different duration

198
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,320
and different type.

199
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,060
And so I found, that as soon
as I started using Headspace,

200
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,990
that I was meditating
far more consistently.

201
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,780
One of the great things about meditation

202
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,880
is that it works the first time,

203
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,140
and it works every time.

204
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,570
And the more consistently I do it,

205
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,380
the more positive
benefits I seem to derive.

206
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,610
If you'd like to try Headspace,

207
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,660

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,640
you'll get a free one month trial

210
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,910
with all of Headspace's
full library of meditations.

211
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,330
This is the best deal offered
by Headspace right now.

212
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,570
So if you're interested,

213
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,580
go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

214
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,550
I'd like to point you toward

215
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,570
what I think is a very valuable
zero cost resource online.

216
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,610
Recently, I took part in an
event called Rethink Education

217
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,370
that was put on by Logitech.

218
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,820
And there, I gave a 20 minute lecture

219
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,260
where I describe the classic

220
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,120
and modern neuroplasticity literature

221
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,150
in both animal models and humans.

222
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,010
The neuro-plasticity
literature is, of course,

223
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,260
the literature that describes

224
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,640
how to rewire the brain in order to learn.

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,880
During that 20 minute talk,

226
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,930
I describe that literature,

227
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,040
but I also spell out what I call

228
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,190
the neuroplasticity super protocol,

229
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,960
which is nine-plus steps of things

230
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,260
that teachers can apply in the classroom

231
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,930
to teach any sort of information,

232
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,890
music, math, sports, anything,

233
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,270
and that students of any kind in any age

234
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,270
can use to enhance the
speed and depth of learning.

235
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,670
You can find that talk on YouTube

236
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,650
by following the link in
the caption to this episode,

237
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,170
or by simply going to YouTube

238
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,220
and entering the search
terms: Logitech Huberman.

239
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,850
Some of the most frequent questions I get

240
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,360
are about food and the brain.

241
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,690
Everybody seems to want to
know what they should eat

242
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,200
and what they shouldn't eat

243
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,130
in order to have peak brain function,

244
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,620
to be able to focus, and
memorize things, and so forth,

245
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,420
and in order to maintain
brain health over time,

246
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,650
because nobody wants to lose their memory

247
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,210
or have troubles with cognition.

248
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,370
Fortunately, there are a lot of data now

249
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,540
from really good quality
peer-reviewed studies

250
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,860
that indicate certain
things that we can do,

251
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,290
including certain foods
that we should eat,

252
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,700
and perhaps, even some
foods that we should avoid,

253
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,400
in order to enhance our brain function.

254
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,750
And, of course, when I say, brain,

255
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,730
what I really mean is
nervous system function,

256
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,270
because how we are able to move,

257
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,940
and remember things, et cetera,

258
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,530
doesn't just depend on the neurons,

259
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,820
the nerve cells that are in our head,

260
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,040
it also depends on our spinal cord,

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,910
and the neurons that connect
to all the organs of our body.

262
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,940
So in general,

263
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,400
there are two categories of things

264
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,720
that are going to improve brain health

265
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,030
from the perspective of nutrition.

266
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,300
The first category is the general category

267
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,120
of things that we eat and avoid,

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,400
and things that we do and avoid doing,

269
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,210
that will modulate brain
health and function.

270
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,640
What do I mean by modulate?

271
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,333
Well, getting quality
sleep on a regular basis.

272
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,580
Making sure that you're
socially connected.

273
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,710
Making sure that you're not depressed.

274
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,400
All these things are vitally important

275
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,610
to our overall health ,

276
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,780
and, of course, they will
impact brain function,

277
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,440
but they do it, more or
less, indirectly, okay?

278
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,040
There are a few things
that happen in sleep

279
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,580
which directly benefit brain function,

280
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,130
and repair, et cetera.

281
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,880
But today, I really want to concentrate,

282
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
not on the things that
modulate our overall health,

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,570
but rather, the things that
mediate brain health directly,

284
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,720
and in particular, how certain
foods enhance brain function.

285
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,350
And we are going to talk about

286
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,750
how we can change our
relationship to food.

287
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,810
Literally, how we can start
to prefer certain foods

288
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,380
that are better for us than others.

289
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,110
So just briefly, I want to touch
on the modulatory components,

290
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,090
because they are vital.

291
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,400
First of all,

292
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,040
getting quality sleep on a regular basis

293
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,480
and ample sleep on a regular basis

294
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,770
is the foundation of all mental
health and physical health.

295
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,360
There's no question about that.

296
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,090
We've have done several episodes,

297
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,370
including the Mastering
Your Sleep episode,

298
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,610
which is episode two of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

299
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,670
And we've done a lot of other episodes

300
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,960
that are all about sleep,

301
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,830
and how to get better at sleeping.

302
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,460
So I just want to make crystal clear,

303
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,510
that unless you're sleeping
well on a regular basis,

304
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,610
your brain will suffer.

305
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,770
You won't be able to focus
very well, learn very well,

306
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,360
and indeed, there are data linking

307
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,960
poor quality sleep to dementia,

308
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,850
or at least exacerbating
pre-existing dementias,

309
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,700
and things of that sort.

310
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,300
So get your sleep in order.

311
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,910
The other, of course, is
cardiovascular health and exercise.

312
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,860
The general prescription that's
out there in the literature,

313
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,440
and I think is well supported,

314
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,130
is to get somewhere
between 150 and 180 minutes

315
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,250
of cardiovascular exercise per week.

316
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,580
If you choose to also use
resistance exercise, that's great.

317
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,750
But the 150 to 180
minutes minimum per week

318
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,370
of cardiovascular exercise

319
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,840
is crucial for heart health,

320
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,470
and heart health directly
relates to brain health,

321
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,680
because the brain consumes
a lot of oxygen, glucose,

322
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,570
and other factors that are
delivered via the blood.

323
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,610
So if your arteries are clogged up,

324
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,430
and you've got poor
vascular supply to the brain

325
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,700
in any region of the brain,

326
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,300
your brain will suffer.

327
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,453
So get cardiovascular health in order.

328
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,680
Now, with those two
modulatory elements set forth,

329
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,100
so that we're all aware that they're there

330
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,530
and they are vitally important,

331
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,210
now, I'd like to turn to the
elements that have been shown

332
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,990
to be vitally important
for directly controlling,

333
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,310
for mediating neuron function.

334
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,640
Neurons, of course, are
nerve cells in the brain,

335
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,000
and there are other cell
types, too, of course,

336
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,010
that will impact brain function.

337
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,420
The most prominent of which
are the so-called glia.

338
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,680
Glia means glue.

339
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,790
But even though, for a long time,

340
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,690
people thought that these cells

341
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,590
were just kind of holding
things together passively,

342
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,310
the glia play a very active role

343
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,060
in the metabolism neurons
in brain function,

344
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,140
and probably, also, in cognition,

345
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,410
in thinking, and so forth.

346
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,050
So what are the things that
directly impact brain health,

347
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,870
and what are the foods that we can eat

348
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,730
that will support brain health?

349
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,487
Generally, when we think
about neuron function

350
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,230
and brain function,

351
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,970
we default to a discussion about fuel.

352
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,950
The fact that neurons use
glucose, which is blood sugar,

353
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,770
and that they require a lot of it.

354
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,590
In some cases, they'll use ketones,

355
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,250
which we will talk about
a little bit later,

356
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,480
especially in people that are
following a low carbohydrate

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,470
or ketogenic diet.

358
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,980
But before we can even consider the fuels

359
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,320
that neurons use in order to function,

360
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,620
we have to talk about

361
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,680
the elements that actually
allow those neurons to be there

362
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,020
and to stay healthy,

363
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,800
what actually makes up those neurons.

364
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,710
And that brings us to, what I would argue,

365
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,410
is the most important food
element for brain function,

366
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,230
and that is fat.

367
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,900
And that may come as a surprise,

368
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,140
but unless one considers the
water content of the brain,

369
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,193
which is very high,

370
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,580
a lot of our brain,

371
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,820
and a lot of the integrity
of the nerve cells,

372
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,880
the so-called neurons in our brain,

373
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,950
and the other types of
cells comes from fat.

374
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,870
And that's because nerve cells
and other cells in the brain

375
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,990
have a external layer.

376
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,610
It's what's sometimes called
a double-layered membrane.

377
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,320
It's essentially two thin layers

378
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,967
that serve as a boundary
between those cells,

379
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,710
and that boundary is important,

380
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,250
because how things pass
across that boundary

381
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,600
actually regulates the
electrical activity of neurons,

382
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,900
which is the way that neurons
fire, and communicate,

383
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,150
and keep you thinking, and acting,

384
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,090
and doing all the good things

385
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,270
that those neurons allow us to do.

386
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,830
And those membranes are made up of fats,

387
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,090
but they're not made up of the fats

388
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,290
that are around our belly,

389
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,000
around the other organs of our body.

390
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,640
They're not made up of storage fat.

391
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,400
They are made up of structural fat.

392
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,380
And maintaining the so-called integrity

393
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,870
of that structural fat,

394
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,020
meaning the health of those neurons,

395
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,900
is going to come, in large part,

396
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,850
from the foods that we eat.

397
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,990
Now, this needs to be underscored.

398
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,060
What I'm saying is, that
the foods that we eat

399
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,100
actually provide the structural
basis, the building blocks,

400
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,690
of the very neurons that
allow us to think over time.

401
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,470
And as I mentioned earlier,

402
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,920
the fat that makes up those
neurons and other nerve cells

403
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,210
is different than the other
types of fat in the body.

404
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,440
So what type of fat is it,

405
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,770
and what should we eat

406
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,550
in order to support that
fat and those neurons?

407
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,570
And the answer is

408
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,820
the so-called essential fatty
acids and phospholipids.

409
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,440
Now, those are, more or
less, the same thing,

410
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,880
but I just want to make
a very large literature

411
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,050
very crystal clear.

412
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,980
Essential fatty acids can include

413
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,420
the so-called EPA variety or DHA variety.

414
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,080
You hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.

415
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,510
Most people are getting enough
omega-6s from their diet.

416
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,280
Not everybody, but most people
are getting enough omega-6s.

417
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,410
However, most people
are not getting enough

418
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,380
omega-3s in their diet to
support healthy brain function

419
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,050
in the short and long-term.

420
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,410
I've talked before about the benefits of

421
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,270
elevating the levels of
omega-3s in one's diet

422
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,870
for sake of offsetting depression
and for enhancing mood.

423
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,370
And indeed, there's a
wealth of literature now

424
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,010
pointing to the fact that
ingesting at least one, or two,

425
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,532
or even three grams per day of

426
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,700
EPA form of essential fatty acid

427
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,100
can have effects, positive effects,

428
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,320
on mood and wellbeing
that are at least on par

429
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,590
with some of the major
antidepressant treatments out there,

430
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,670
but without similar side effects

431
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,210
to those antidepressant treatments.

432
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,920
And that for people that are
already taking antidepressants,

433
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,350
that supplementing with one, to two,

434
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,760
to three grams of EPA
essential fatty acids

435
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,319
can actually allow a lower dose of

436
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,029
antidepressant treatment to be used,

437
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,380
and still be effective.

438
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,970
So that's depression.

439
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,859
But just in terms of maintaining
normal cognitive function

440
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,079
in people that aren't depressed,

441
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,289
the EPAs and omega-3s seem to
play a very important role.

442
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,750
Of course, you can supplement EPAs

443
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,240
through various fish oils,

444
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,300
and it could be liquid fish
oil, or a capsule fish oil.

445
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Some people, if they're not
interested in eating fish

446
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,110
for whatever reason,

447
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,950
they're allergic, or for ethical reasons,

448
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,260
they can take krill oil.

449
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,800
And if they don't want to use krill oil,

450
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,730
they can use algae and other forms of EPA.

451
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,300
However, I think it's clear,

452
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,870
that one can get a lot of
EPA from the proper foods.

453
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,820
And it turns out, that those
foods, not surprisingly,

454
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,380
don't just contain high levels of EPA,

455
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,160
but they also contain other things

456
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,020
that are beneficial for brain health.

457
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,890
So what are foods that
are high in omega-3s

458
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,030
that we should all probably be consuming,

459
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,763
at least on a daily basis?

460
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,380
The number one is fish.

461
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,350
So things like mackerel,
and salmon, and herring,

462
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,330
and oysters, and sardines, and anchovies.

463
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,350
And perhaps, the heavyweight champion

464
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,280
of EPAs per unit volume is caviar.

465
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,670
Now, I don't know about you,

466
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,460
but I'm not eating a lot of fish.

467
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,580
I'm not eating a lot of caviar.

468
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,413
I don't think...

469
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,150
I can't remember the
last time I had a caviar,

470
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,610
unless it was sprinkled
on a little bit of sushi.

471
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,560
I'm not a big fish eater personally.

472
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,940
I will from time to time.

473
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,410
But that's one reason why

474
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,690
one might want to supplement
with EPAs from another source.

475
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,630
But also, EPAs are found
in chia seeds, in walnuts,

476
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,010
in soybeans, and other plant-based foods.

477
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,550
You can look these up online,

478
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,940
and you'll immediately see

479
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,570
that there are a lot of sources of EPAs.

480
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,790
And many of the foods that I listed off

481
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,070
might be appetizing to you,

482
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,780
some of them might be unappetizing to you,

483
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,230
or some of them you might
be sort of neutral about.

484
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,170
But it's very clear,

485
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,680
that eating foods that
are rich in omega-3s,

486
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,360
and/or supplementing with omega-3s,

487
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,920
to get above that 1.5 grams,

488
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,500
and ideally, up to two,
or even three grams,

489
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,280
per day of EPA can be very
beneficial for cognitive function

490
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,570
in the short and long-term.

491
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,650
Later in the episode,

492
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,570
I'm going talk about

493
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,040
how to actually change your relationship

494
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,930
to particular foods,

495
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,760
so that foods that you
don't particularly like,

496
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,860
you can actually start to like more,

497
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,610
and that might be
important for those of you

498
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,607
that are thinking, mackerel, sardines.

499
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,030
I'm making this face,

500
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,350
'cause, frankly, those are not
foods that I naturally like.

501
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,780
But again, I want to emphasize,

502
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,760
that you don't have to consume fish

503
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,890
and animal products in order
to get sufficient EPAs.

504
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,170
You can get them from plants.

505
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,650
But I do believe,

506
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,290
based on the quality
peer-reviewed research,

507
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,640
that everybody should be striving
to get a minimum threshold

508
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,800
of at least a gram and
a half of EPAs per day

509
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
one way or the other.

510
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,930
The great thing about omega-3s

511
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,950
is that they are also
thought to be beneficial

512
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,710
for things like cardiovascular health.

513
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,030
And although there's
some controversy there

514
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,870
as to whether or not two
grams, or three grams,

515
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,010
or six grams is ideal for
cardiovascular health,

516
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,310
I think the bulk of
evidence points to the fact

517
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,260
that getting sufficient
omega-3s in the diet

518
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,830
is going to support cardiovascular health.

519
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,580
Certainly not the only
thing people should be doing

520
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,540
to support their cardiovascular health.

521
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,680
Aerobic exercise, and so
forth, being important also.

522
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,447
But it does seem to support
cardio vascular health,

523
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:20,170
and in doing so, supporting brain health.

524
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,400
However, what I'm emphasizing is,

525
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,160
ingestion of omega-3s to support

526
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,800
the very cells within the brain

527
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,040
that make up our cognition,

528
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,710
that allow for cognition,
and for movement, and memory,

529
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,040
and all the other marvelous
things that the brain does.

530
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,720
The other compound that has been shown

531
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,540
to be directly supportive
of neuronal function

532
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,640
is phosphatidylserine,

533
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,950
which is abundant in meats and in fish.

534
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,800
So here we are again

535
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,830
back to fish being an important source

536
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,240
of brain supporting food.

537
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,230
Phosphatidylserine is
something that, nowadays,

538
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,450
people are supplementing.

539
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,980
It's a lipid-like compound that,

540
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,340
at least in three studies,

541
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,060
have been shown to improve cognition.

542
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,310
These weren't huge effects,

543
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,730
but they were statistically
significant effects.

544
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,770
And as well in more than three,

545
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,430
at least five studies,

546
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,890
to reduce cognitive decline.

547
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,820
And this is interesting.

548
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,653
In every case,

549
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:17,530
it was 300 milligrams
supplemented phosphatidylserine,

550
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,363
but one, again,

551
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:21,160
doesn't need to supplement
phosphatidylserine.

552
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,750
Phosphatidylserine can be
derived, as I mentioned,

553
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,960
from meats and fish,

554
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,070
and to some extent, from
cabbage of all things.

555
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,470
So I don't know how much
cabbage people are ingesting.

556
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,100
But later, when we talk about gut health,

557
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,430
and the relationship between
gut health and brain health,

558
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,100
I'll mention fermented foods.

559
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,370
And, of course, one of the most

560
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,170
readily available
fermented foods out there

561
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,790
that at least many people
find appetizing is sauerkraut,

562
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,210
which is, of course, made from cabbage.

563
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,470
It's fermented cabbage.

564
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,730
So for those of you that
do consume meat and fish,

565
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,930
provided you're getting enough fish,

566
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,900
you're probably getting
enough phosphatidylserine.

567
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,160
For those of you that are interested in

568
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,180
supplementing phosphatidylserine
to get these effects

569
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,620
that were reported in
these various manuscripts,

570
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,090
which, by the way, I've
read, and looked solid.

571
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,590
I mean, I don't think we've seen

572
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,220
the landmark study showing

573
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,040
that supplementing with phosphatidylserine

574
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,610
at 300 milligrams per day

575
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,690
is going to create a huge offsetting

576
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,260
of a massive cognitive decline,

577
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,520
or a massive increase in brain function.

578
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,640
These seem to be modest effects,

579
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,030
but the effects do appear to be real.

580
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,030
For those of you that are interested

581
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,940
in supplementing with phosphatidylserine,

582
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,510
it's a relatively
inexpensive supplement that,

583
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,690
again, is lipid-like.

584
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,440
So it's mimicking some of the same things

585
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,380
that you would get from food,

586
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,600
but in a higher concentration.

587
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,133
Now, after EPA, fatty acids,
and phosphatidylserine,

588
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,800
I would say, third on the list

589
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,740
of things that come from food

590
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,380
that can readily support brain
function would be choline,

591
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,690
and that's because of the
relationship to choline

592
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,180
in the biosynthesis pathway
for a acetylcholine.

593
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,360
Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator,

594
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,440
not a neurotransmitter,

595
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,743
but a neuromodulator in the brain.

596
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:00,260
A neuromodulator is a
chemical that modulates

597
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,520
the function of many brain circuits,

598
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,720
and also, circuits within the body.

599
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,430
I'll mention what those are in a moment.

600
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,670
But acetylcholine, as a neuromodulator,

601
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,930
tends to enhance the activity,

602
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,980
the electrical activity
and chemical activity,

603
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,740
of certain sets of neurons,

604
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,750
and downplay the activity
of other neurons.

605
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,720
So it's sort of a conductor of sorts

606
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,890
leading to enhanced function

607
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,190
and activity in certain
brain areas and circuits,

608
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,363
and not in others.

609
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,970
For instance, the brain
areas that are involved

610
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,570
in focus and alertness.

611
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,980
We have multiple clusters
of neurons in our brain

612
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,890
that make acetylcholine.

613
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,650
Two of the most prominent and well-known

614
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,050
are the so-called nucleus basalis,

615
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,510
which is a cluster of neurons

616
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,130
deep in the basal forebrain

617
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,900
that highlight particular
areas of our brain.

618
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,190
Highlight meaning when acetylcholine

619
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,890
is released from those neurons

620
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,010
at their nerve endings in
particular areas of the brain,

621
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,720
those particular areas of the brain

622
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,760
can undergo enhanced levels of activity

623
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,300
relative to surrounding area.

624
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,620
So it's kind of a
electrical highlighter pen,

625
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,093
if you will, by analogy.

626
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,390
That is the basis of much
of what we call focus,

627
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,220
or our ability to concentrate

628
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,350
on a particular batch of information

629
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,320
that's coming in through our
eyes, our ears, our nose,

630
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,550
or even things that we're
just thinking in our head.

631
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,640
So having ample choline for
production of acetylcholine

632
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,230
allows for focus through, of
course, many intervening steps.

633
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,020
There are also regions of the brain

634
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,270
in the so-called back of
the brain, the hindbrain,

635
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,080
that release acetylcholine

636
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,240
that are involved in
general states of alertness.

637
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,510
And not surprisingly then,

638
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,970
many of the treatments
for Alzheimer's disease,

639
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,710
which is an inability

640
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,210
or challenges with remembering
things and focusing,

641
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:44,180
are drugs that impact the
acetylcholine pathway,

642
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,570
and are aimed at enhancing
the amount of acetylcholine

643
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,530
that's available to neurons.

644
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,780
And it can do that through a
number of different mechanisms.

645
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,930
You can do that by enhancing

646
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,870
the amount of acetylcholine
that's created,

647
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,620
or you can do that by taking a drug

648
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,880
that can reduce the amount of enzyme

649
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,250
that gobbles up the acetylcholine,

650
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,320
and in doing so, leading
to more net acetylcholine.

651
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,400
But outside of the scenario

652
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
where somebody has cognitive
decline due to Alzheimer's,

653
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,040
all of us are able to focus
to some degree, or not,

654
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,820
or are able to be alert
to some degree, or not,

655
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,010
based on the amount of
acetylcholine that we have.

656
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,070
Now, other processes,
of course, are involved.

657
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,080
But what this means,

658
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,470
is that making sure that we have enough

659
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,950
of the substrates to create
acetylcholine is vital

660
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,500
if we want to be able to focus,

661
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,770
and that's why dietary
choline is so vital.

662
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,280
And the primary source for
dietary choline would be eggs,

663
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,030
and in particular, egg yolks.

664
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,730
And this, again, has a very
interesting relationship

665
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,123
to our evolution as well.

666
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,590
We're always referred
to as hunter gatherers,

667
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,970
but when one hears hunters,

668
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,560
we often think about
meat and animal sources.

669
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,100
And indeed, as a species,

670
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,290
we hunted many, many
other species of animals

671
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,260
to consume them, and still do.

672
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,690
But we also fished.

673
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,800
We talked about that earlier.

674
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,147
And consumed a lot of fish,

675
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,080
and we consumed a lot of eggs.

676
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,830
Eggs are an incredibly rich source

677
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,840
of nutrients for the brain,

678
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,800
and that's because the egg, actually,

679
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,633
if you think about it,

680
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,710
contains all the nutrients
that are required

681
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,230
in order for an organism to grow.

682
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,100
You know, a bird that's in a egg shell,

683
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,980
it's got the yolk there,

684
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
and it's using that yolk for a reason.

685
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,780
It's using that yolk as a source of fuel.

686
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,620
It's using that yolk

687
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,830
as a source of, literally, building blocks

688
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,470
in order to create its nervous system.

689
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,550
Many years ago, I worked on chick embryos,

690
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,960
and it was these amazing experiments.

691
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,920
You could actually take an egg,

692
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,420
and you could create a
little window in the top,

693
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,740
and these were fertilized eggs,

694
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,950
and you'd see, over time,
you could peer in there,

695
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,420
literally look in with a microscope,

696
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,600
or even with the naked eye,

697
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,890
and you would see this little chick embryo

698
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,710
sitting on top of that
yolk growing, and growing,

699
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,550
and growing, and growing,

700
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,300
and the yolk getting smaller, and smaller.

701
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,080
It's really, yeah, incredible.

702
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,470
They're using that as a source

703
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,300
for all the building blocks of the body,

704
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,520
but in particular, the nervous system.

705
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,470
So eggs are a rich source of choline.

706
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,810
Some people will supplement with choline.

707
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,840
However, food sources seem to
be the best source of choline.

708
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,440
And as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,

709
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,430
there are plenty of foods
that are non-animal-based

710
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,390
that contain choline.

711
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,560
So if you're somebody
who doesn't eat eggs,

712
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,830
or doesn't want to eat eggs,

713
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,830
things like potatoes, nuts, and seeds,

714
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,970
and grains, and fruit,

715
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,940
they don't have as much choline as eggs,

716
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,490
but they do contain choline.

717
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,270
So you can look up the values of choline

718
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,310
that are present in those various foods,

719
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,881
and make sure that you're
reaching the threshold

720
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:32,714
amount of choline for you.

721
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:34,620
In general, most people
should probably strive

722
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,730
to get somewhere between 500 milligrams

723
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,650
and a gram of choline per day.

724
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,950
So 1,000 milligrams.

725
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,953
And some people rely on supplementation

726
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:43,880
in order to hit those levels,

727
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,570
because they're not
eating a lot of egg yolks,

728
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,980
or they're not eating
a lot of other foods.

729
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,520
Certain fish contain
choline, for instance,

730
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,930
and the other foods I
listed off a few minutes ago

731
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,000
from plant-based sources.

732
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,100
So some people will supplement with

733
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,750
50 to 100 milligrams,

734
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,240
or whatever amount is necessary

735
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,850
to get them up to that one gram,

736
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,720
or even a two gram, dose per day.

737
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,050
So we have three things

738
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,713
that we know can support nerve cells.

739
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:13,290
EPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,

740
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,280
phosphatidylserine, and choline,

741
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,920
those three things I would list off

742
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,720
as the top three things

743
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,740
for enhancing neuron function,

744
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,340
and the integrity of neurons
in the short and long-term.

745
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,620
And this, again, is setting aside

746
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,090
the vitally important factors
of hydration and electrolytes.

747
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,520
I've said it before on other podcasts,

748
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,750
but if you're not ingesting enough water,

749
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,250
and you're not getting enough sodium,

750
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,200
and magnesium, and potassium,

751
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,110
then, obviously, your neurons can't run,

752
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,650
because a lot of the brain is water.

753
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,240
You need to maintain proper hydration.

754
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,050
And sodium, potassium, and
magnesium are important

755
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,400
in order for nerve cells to function.

756
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,150
In fact, they are actually
the components, the ions,

757
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,420
that pass across those lipid membranes,

758
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,950
those little fatty membranes

759
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,070
that we were talking about earlier,

760
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,000
that allow the neurons to
generate electrical activity

761
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
and communicate with one another.

762
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,860
So definitely, you want to hydrate enough.

763
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,400
We will do an entire other episode

764
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,100
all about hydration and electrolytes.

765
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,100
But omega-3s, the EPAs,
phosphatidylserine, and choline,

766
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,130
it's obvious are going to
improve brain function.

767
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,640
How much they will improve brain function

768
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,473
probably depends on

769
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,900
how well your brain
was working previously.

770
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,440
In fact, many of the studies

771
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,520
that have looked at the
effectiveness of these compounds

772
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,470
have looked in people that
are suffering from mild

773
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,720
or even severe cognitive decline.

774
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,960
And while the outcomes
of those studies vary,

775
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,130
given the interest in
maintaining brain function,

776
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,240
given the fact that we
don't make new neurons

777
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,780
throughout our entire life,

778
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,310
and given that everybody has to eat,

779
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,130
these are quality healthy foods

780
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,840
that we should all be ingesting anyways.

781
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,500
And it's clear that they
can support brain function

782
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,920
to some degree or another.

783
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,130
Many people will ask what I do
in light of this information.

784
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,210
And while I can only talk
about what works for me,

785
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,110
I choose to ingest fish
oil mainly in liquid form,

786
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,397
because that turns out
to be the easiest way

787
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:05,340
and the most economically affordable way

788
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,470
to do it for most people.

789
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,790
So there are various forms
of liquid fish oil out there.

790
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,390
Some of them include some lemon flavoring,

791
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,720
so it doesn't taste like fish oil,

792
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
because frankly, fish oil, to me,

793
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,110
is sort of noxious tasting.

794
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,980
And I'll take a tablespoon
of that, or two, per day.

795
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,810
If I'm traveling, I'll
use the capsule form

796
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,410
in order to hit that threshold.

797
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,240
For me, about two, sometimes even three,

798
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,560
grams per day of EPA.

799
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,440
So not just two or three
grams per day of fish oil,

800
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,690
but two or three grams per day of EPA.

801
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,110
Now, if I'm eating fish,

802
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,030
which as I mentioned
earlier, is not often,

803
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,090
then I might reduce the amount
of fish oil that I take.

804
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,313
But that's my major source of fish oil.

805
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,480
Currently, I do not supplement
with phosphatidylserine.

806
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,290
A number of people that I know and trust,

807
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,129
and indeed, several colleagues of mine,

808
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,150
do take phosphatidylserine.

809
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,440
I don't have any good explanation

810
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,580
for why I don't take it yet,

811
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,520
but I have not tried
supplementing with it yet.

812
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,630
Maybe if some of you have,

813
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,790
you can place your experience
in the comment section.

814
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,640
It would be of interest.

815
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,720
And then in terms of choline,

816
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,660
in order to get choline in my diet,

817
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,040
I do pay attention to

818
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,140
the various foods that contain choline,

819
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,750
and I try and get those foods
on a semi-regular basis.

820
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,530
I do supplement with
something called alpha-GPC,

821
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,010
which is, essentially, in
the acetylcholine pathway,

822
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,840
or biosynthesis pathway.

823
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,280
I don't take it very often,

824
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,350
but I will take 300 milligrams

825
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,410
of alpha-GPC from time to time.

826
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,243
From time to time,

827
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:33,300
I mean anywhere from two
to three times per week.

828
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,740
I'll generally do it early in the day,

829
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,573
'cause it, for me,

830
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:37,590
can have a little bit
of a stimulant effect.

831
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,080
Although, it's not nearly
as stimulating, say,

832
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,620
as a double espresso, or triple espresso.

833
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,090
But that's one way in which I
enhance my choline function.

834
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,470
And some people choose to
get it from supplementation,

835
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,180
because it's straightforward.

836
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,013
There are a lot of supplements out there

837
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:52,840
that contain alpha-GPC.

838
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,280
Some people are taking dosages

839
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,950
as high as 900 milligrams per day.

840
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,270
That sounds very high to me.

841
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,250
The studies of offsetting
cognitive decline using alpha-GPC

842
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,360
did use quite high dosages of 600 to 900,

843
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,860
or even 1200, milligrams per day.

844
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,910
So it has been used at those
much higher concentrations.

845
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,170
But because, fortunately,

846
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,250
at least, not yet, or not to my awareness,

847
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,470
I'm not suffering from
any cognitive decline,

848
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,810
I will supplement with 300
milligrams every now and again.

849
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,510
Next on my list of compounds

850
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,550
that have been shown in
peer-reviewed research

851
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,520
to improve neuronal and
brain function is creatine.

852
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,880
Creatine can be derived from meat sources.

853
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,533
It can also be supplemented.

854
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,030
Some of you are probably
familiar with creatine

855
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,230
or have heard about creatine

856
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,880
from the context of the
health and fitness world,

857
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,240
where creatine is used to
bring more water into muscles,

858
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,570
which can enhance the
strength of those muscles,

859
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,720
as well as bring water into other tissues.

860
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,430
It doesn't just draw
more water into muscle,

861
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,113
it can draw more water
into the body generally.

862
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,370
Creatine has also been shown to have

863
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,340
an important role in brain function.

864
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,100
And once again, this is
something that came up

865
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,263
during the discussion about
depression a few episodes back.

866
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,760
Creatine can actually be used
as a fuel source in the brain.

867
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,850
And there's some evidence

868
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,130
that it can enhance the function

869
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,780
of certain frontal cortical
circuits that feed down onto,

870
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,633
or rather, connect to, areas of the brain

871
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:21,200
that are involved in mood
regulation and motivation.

872
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,370
And that's where creatine
plays a role in depression,

873
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,470
or rather, where creatine supplementation

874
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,180
seems to be able to assist in
some forms of mild depression.

875
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,410
That's an emerging literature.

876
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,330
It's still not well-established.

877
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,350
However, there is now ample evidence

878
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,350
that creatine supplementation
can enhance brain function

879
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,770
in certain contexts.

880
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,190
And if you're interested in

881
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,590
learning more about
what those contexts are,

882
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,600
there's an excellent
review that just came out.

883
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,480
The first author is
Roschel, R-O-S-C-H-E-L.

884
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,660
We will provide a link to this study,

885
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,240
rather, this review,
excuse me, in the caption.

886
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,890
This was published just
very recently in 2021.

887
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,530
And one thing to make clear,

888
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,440
is that creatine supplementation

889
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,990
has been shown to be especially useful

890
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,480
for people that are not consuming any meat

891
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,440
or other sources of foods
that are rich in creatine.

892
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,969
What is the threshold level
of creatine to supplement

893
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,039
in order to get the cognitive benefit?

894
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,170
It appears to be at
least five grams per day.

895
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,590
Now, the most typical form of creatine

896
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,290
is so-called creatine monohydrate.

897
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,370
There are other forms of creatine as well,

898
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,690
some of which are thought to not draw

899
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,530
as much water into non-muscle tissues,

900
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,929
and for some people,
that's attractive to them.

901
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:35,619
They don't want water sitting
below their skin, et cetera.

902
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,453
I should emphasize,

903
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:39,679
that the responses to creatine
in that sense can differ.

904
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,699
Some people get a little
bit of water retention.

905
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,399
Some people experience more.

906
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,909
There's some evidence
that creatine can impact

907
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,089
some of the hormonal pathways,

908
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,340
that it might enhance levels of

909
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,920
so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT,

910
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,550
and therefore, because DHT
is involved in hair loss,

911
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,580
there are these theories that
creatine can cause hair loss.

912
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,610
And indeed, for people that are

913
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,973
very DHT sensitive, it might.

914
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,580
There's going to be a lot of
variation person to person

915
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,250
in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT,

916
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,640
and how many DHT receptors
they have on their scalp,

917
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,610
and therefore, whether or not
they experience hair loss.

918
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,100
I'm just giving you all this information,

919
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,070
so that you're aware of the various things

920
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,530
that creatine can do.

921
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,470
But nonetheless, I think it's interesting

922
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,150
that creatine supplementation
of five grams per day,

923
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,680
that's creatine monohydrate,

924
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,070
has been shown to improve cognition

925
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,240
in people that aren't getting
creatine from animal sources.

926
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,880
And there's some evidence
detailed within the review

927
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,560
that I just described,

928
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,990
that creatine supplementation
can also enhance cognition

929
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,060
in people that are also
eating animal products.

930
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,930
So I personally take
creatine five grams per day,

931
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,590
and have for a very long time.

932
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,530
I can't say that I've
noticed a tremendous benefit,

933
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,667
because I've actually
never really come off it,

934
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,660
and so I've never done
the control experiment.

935
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,530
I take it more as kind of a
baseline insurance policy.

936
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,120
For me, I'm probably losing,

937
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,560
I'm certainly losing some of my hair.

938
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,210
Whether or not that's
due to creatine or not,

939
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,200
I've never done the analysis.

940
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,210
But what I can say is that,

941
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,850
I generally consume these things

942
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,290
like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC

943
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:16,290
to set a general context
of support for my neurons,

944
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,330
for my brain.

945
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,040
And, of course, I also pay attention

946
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,280
to the foods that contain
these various compounds.

947
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,700
So I don't actively eat additional meat

948
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,900
just to obtain creatine.

949
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,580
I eat a fairly limited amount of meat.

950
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,760
I don't restrict it,

951
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
and I do eat meat,

952
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,410
but I don't actively seek
out creatine in my diet.

953
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,690
Rather, I use supplementation

954
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,400
in order to hit that five
grams per day threshold.

955
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,380
Next on the list of foods

956
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,870
that are beneficial for brain health

957
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,450
is one that you've probably
seen pictures of online,

958
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,110
because there seems to be a practice

959
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,490
of putting pictures of blueberries

960
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,627
and other dark berries next
to any title that says,

961
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,377
"Foods that benefit your brain".

962
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,090
There are a lot of foods out there

963
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,980
that have been purported
to improve brain function.

964
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,280
The interesting thing about
blueberries and other berries,

965
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,650
blackberries, dark currants,

966
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,110
any of these thin-skinned berries

967
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,630
that are purpleish in color,

968
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,860
is that they contain what
are called anthocyanins.

969
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,610
Anthocyanins actually
have some really nice data

970
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,050
to support the fact that
they improve brain function.

971
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,010
Now, whether or not it is
direct effects on neurons,

972
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,853
or whether or not it is
by lowering inflammation,

973
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,000
or some other modulatory
effect, isn't quite clear.

974
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,910
But I think by now, there's
enough data to support the fact

975
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:36,950
that eating a cup or two of
blueberries pretty often,

976
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,510
every day, or maybe you have blackberries,

977
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,970
or maybe it's black currants,

978
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,770
that these anthocyanins are good for us,

979
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,890
that they are enhancing
our overall wellbeing

980
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,990
at a number of different levels.

981
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,560
And just to give you a couple examples

982
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,880
of where there are actually
peer-reviewed studies

983
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,940
to support those statements,

984
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,230
the anthocyanins of which blueberries

985
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,350
and other dark berries are rich in

986
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,450
have been shown to reduce
the amount of DNA damage,

987
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,610
has been shown to reduce significantly,

988
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,700
although, albeit, slightly,
excuse me, cognitive decline.

989
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,190
And that particular study was

990
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,430
supplementation of a blueberry extract.

991
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,757
I'll talk about the
difference between extract

992
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,400
and actual blueberries in a moment.

993
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,350
But supplementation of blueberry extract

994
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,220
in offsetting cognitive
decline in elderly people.

995
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,150
So what constitutes elderly

996
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,530
is always a little bit of
a debate and a discussion.

997
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,210
But in this case, what they did,

998
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,767
is they supplemented with
somewhere between 428,

999
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,110
I don't know why they selected 428,

1000
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,570
and 598 milligrams of
anthocyanins daily for 12 weeks

1001
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,870
was associated with improvements

1002
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,370
on verbal learning and memory.

1003
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,830
And they had some other beneficial changes

1004
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,600
that were within the bodily organs,

1005
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,950
and blood glucose
regulation, and so forth.

1006
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,210
Positive changes.

1007
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,950
But that's one study.

1008
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,120
In this case, elderly meant 65 or older.

1009
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,870
That study, and a number
of studies like it,

1010
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,590
looking at things like
mildly enhanced memory,

1011
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,400
reduced insulin levels,
reduced oxidation of LDL,

1012
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,690
these sorts of things,

1013
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,870
have basically created a situation where

1014
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,460
anytime you Google

1015
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,310
or look up foods that
enhance brain function,

1016
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,040
you're going to see a
picture of a blueberry

1017
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,873
or some other berry,

1018
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:28,060
because of these anthocyanins.

1019
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,200
I personally don't
supplement anthocyanins.

1020
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,240
I do like blueberries.

1021
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,750
I eat blueberries when they're in season.

1022
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,583
I love them.

1023
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,520
I'm what you would call a
drive-by blueberry eater.

1024
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,490
Like if there are blueberries
in a bowl on a table,

1025
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,330
and I'm walking by,

1026
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,740
I just have to scoop them up,

1027
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,800
like some sort of bear, or other animal,

1028
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,760
and pop them in my mouth.

1029
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,210
So blueberries don't last long around me.

1030
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,570
One of the issues with berries,

1031
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,270
like blueberries, and
blackberries, and so forth,

1032
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,910
is that quality sources of
them can be pretty expensive.

1033
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,810
And then, of course, when
they're not in season,

1034
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,643
they're hard to get,

1035
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:59,100
and so that's why some people
will supplement with them.

1036
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,100
So that range of about 400 to
about 600 milligrams per day

1037
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,290
seems to be the minimum threshold

1038
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:12,290
for getting a cognitive effect
in these elderly patients.

1039
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,040
In that case, they were patients.

1040
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,000
A good review about the anthocyanins

1041
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,940
potentially contributing to
offsetting cognitive decline

1042
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,500
in things like Alzheimer's,

1043
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,980
and also enhancing brain function

1044
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,300
in people that don't have Alzheimer's,

1045
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,370
is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L,

1046
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,220
that was published in 2019.

1047
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,203
We will also provide a link
to that study in the caption.

1048
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,290
When one looks across the
total batch of studies

1049
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,030
that are out there on this,

1050
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,200
it appears, that if one
is going to supplement

1051
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,340
with blueberry extract to get the

1052
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,513
anthocyanin effect on cognition,

1053
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,400
dosages of somewhere between
5 1/2 or about 11 grams

1054
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,530
seem optimal with the higher end,

1055
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,430
closer to 10 or 11 grams
being more beneficial.

1056
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,410
The blueberry eaters out there like me,

1057
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,970
who prefer to get their anthocyanins

1058
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,330
from the actual berries,

1059
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,450
it appears that somewhere
between 60 to 120 grams

1060
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,530
of fresh blueberries each day

1061
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,210
is the way that you can
get sufficient anthocyanins

1062
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,770
to at least shift your system,

1063
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,930
or bias your brain towards these
enhanced cognitive effects.

1064
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,870
So we've got EPA fatty acids,

1065
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,430
we've got phosphatidylserine,

1066
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,820
we've got choline,

1067
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,130
we've got creatine, and
we have the anthocyanins.

1068
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,610
And the last item that I'd
like to place in this list

1069
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,620
of food-derived things

1070
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,560
that can enhance brain
function is glutamine.

1071
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,710
Glutamine is a very
interesting amino acid.

1072
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,980
I've talked about
glutamine on here before.

1073
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,110
There's some evidence,
although, somewhat scant,

1074
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,050
there's some evidence that glutamine

1075
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,870
can enhance immune system function.

1076
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,530
So people will supplement with glutamine,

1077
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,870
or people can get glutamine from foods.

1078
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,240
Foods that contain a lot of glutamine

1079
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,690
are things like cottage cheese.

1080
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,110
There are also other sources of glutamine.

1081
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,730
Glutamine is rich in protein rich foods,

1082
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,270
things like beef, chicken,
fish, dairy products, eggs.

1083
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,450
But also, for you non-animal food

1084
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,800
consuming people out there,

1085
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,730
vegetables, including
beans, cabbage, once again,

1086
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,090
spinach, parsley, things of that sort.

1087
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,520
So those foods contain glutamine.

1088
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,420
For people that supplement with glutamine,

1089
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,730
generally, they will take
anywhere from a gram,

1090
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,150
as much as 10 grams, per day.

1091
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,140
Why would they want to do that?

1092
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,410
Well, there's also some
evidence starting to emerge

1093
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,430
that glutamine can help
offset sugar cravings,

1094
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,600
and I've talked about this
on the podcast before.

1095
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,280
We're going to talk more about

1096
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,300
the basis for this a little bit later.

1097
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,650
But in brief, we all
have neurons in our gut

1098
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,790
that sense the amino acid
content, the fat content,

1099
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,660
and the sugar content of
the foods that we eat,

1100
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,410
and signal in a subconscious
way to our brain

1101
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,800
whether or not the
foods that we are eating

1102
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,680
contain certain levels
of certain amino acids.

1103
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,260
And so we actually have
glutamine-sensing neurons in our gut

1104
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,950
that actually have their little processes,

1105
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,840
their little axons and
dendrites, as we call them,

1106
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,260
in the mucosal lining of the gut.

1107
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,620
They're not just sensing glutamine,

1108
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,130
but when they do sense glutamine,

1109
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,813
they respond, and they
send signals to the brain

1110
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:17,500
that are signals of
satiation, of satisfaction.

1111
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,160
And in doing so, can offset
some of the sugar cravings

1112
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,110
that many people suffer from.

1113
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,520
Now, here, we're talking about glutamine

1114
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,010
for sake of enhancing cognitive function.

1115
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,130
And this is interesting,

1116
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,430
because it's been shown that
glutamine supplementation

1117
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,520
can offset some of the
negative effects on cognition

1118
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,520
caused by altitude and oxygen
deprivation of other sorts.

1119
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,710
Yeah, okay, well, that's kind of a strange

1120
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,890
and unique situation.

1121
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,750
If you're going up to altitude,

1122
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,330
should you supplement with glutamine

1123
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,990
in order to be able to think more clearly?

1124
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,270
Well, it appears that there's
good rationale for doing that.

1125
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,400
But the reason I bring this up,

1126
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,060
assuming that most people, including me,

1127
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,790
are not going up to high
altitudes very often,

1128
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,860
is that it's been
well-established that apnea,

1129
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,230
failure to breathe properly during sleep,

1130
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,340
can contribute to age-related,

1131
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,900
and even non-age-related,
cognitive decline.

1132
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,800
There are a lot of reasons for apneas,

1133
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,610
ranging from obesity to
obstruction of the airways,

1134
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,623
for other reasons.

1135
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,727
There are tremendous number
of underlying causes of apnea,

1136
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,480
and it's something to be taken seriously.

1137
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,410
I mean, heart attacks, all
sorts of metabolic issues,

1138
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,370
are caused by apnea.

1139
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,700
Apnea is a serious issue that
disrupts the depth of sleep,

1140
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,300
and it's a serious
health issue in general.

1141
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,330
In any event,

1142
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,040
apnea is associated with cognitive decline

1143
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,920
and cognitive dysfunction,
even in young people,

1144
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,120
and it does appear that
glutamine supplementation

1145
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,230
can offset some of the cognitive deficits

1146
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,570
that are associated with reduced
oxygenation of the brain.

1147
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,910
If you'd like to learn more about

1148
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,800
how apnea can negatively impact cognition,

1149
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,950
there's an excellent paper

1150
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,800
that was published on this in 2018.

1151
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,330
The first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.

1152
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,400
It should be easy to find.

1153
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,233
The title of the paper is

1154
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:10,110
"Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Severity Affects Amyloid Burden

1155
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,180
In Cognitively Normal Elderly".

1156
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,810
This was a longitudinal study.

1157
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:17,560
Amyloid burden is a
correlate of Alzheimer's

1158
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,730
and other forms of neurodegeneration

1159
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,470
and cognitive decline
associated with memory deficits.

1160
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,710
So obstructive sleep apnea
[clears throat], excuse me,

1161
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,180
is a very serious issue

1162
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,880
for which glutamine appears to be able to

1163
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,920
offset some of the
negative symptomatology.

1164
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,720
So how is it that glutamine,

1165
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,460
either from food or
through supplementation,

1166
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,220
can offset some of these

1167
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,890
so-called hypoxic effects
caused by sleep apnea?

1168
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,690
Hypoxia being a lack
of oxygen for the brain

1169
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,540
that relate to cognitive decline.

1170
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,090
It appears to have this positive impact

1171
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,580
by way of reducing inflammation.

1172
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,350
So if you want to look
more deeply into the

1173
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,950
various biological pathways

1174
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,440
and the supplementation regimes for this,

1175
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,700
the paper that I think is
really spectacular is a paper,

1176
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,700
last author is Quaresma, Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.

1177
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,640
That's Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.

1178
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,517
It's a review.

1179
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:14,650
"The Possible Importance of

1180
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,440
Glutamine Supplementation to Mood

1181
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,550
and Cognition in Hypoxia
from High Altitude".

1182
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,100
And even though paper is about

1183
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,240
high altitude-induced hypoxia,

1184
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,280
it does seem to have direct relevance

1185
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,170
to the sorts of apnea that
are related to Alzheimer's

1186
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,950
and other forms of cognitive decline.

1187
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,350
Now, I've been taking
glutamine as a supplement,

1188
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,670
gosh, since I was in college,

1189
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,660
mostly because I felt, either
by superstition or by reality,

1190
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,380
that it protected me from
various flus and colds,

1191
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,380
and things of that sort,

1192
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,723
because of the purported
immune-enhancing effects.

1193
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,190
Again, those immune-enhancing effects

1194
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,220
have some data to support them, not a ton.

1195
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,340
However, I got into the
habit of taking glutamine,

1196
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,620
and now that I've learned that glutamine

1197
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,990
seems to also have some

1198
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,310
cognitive-enhancing effects, possibly,

1199
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,440
it's a supplement that I continue to take.

1200
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,000
I take very small amounts of it,

1201
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,670
but I do take it on a regular basis.

1202
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,130
So that, more or less, completes
the list of things that,

1203
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,970
at least by my read of the literature,

1204
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,740
are things that are
supported by at least three,

1205
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,810
and in some cases, as many
as hundreds of studies,

1206
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,330
in various populations,

1207
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,510
that have been explored
in mouse studies often,

1208
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,250
but also in a number of human studies.

1209
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,350
I want to emphasize again,

1210
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,170
that all of the things I listed out,

1211
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,620
whether or not it's EPAs,

1212
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,300
whether or not it's phosphatidylserine,

1213
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,270
whether or not it's choline,

1214
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,600
whether or not it's the various compounds

1215
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,940
that are in berries, et cetera,

1216
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,130
all of those can be extracted from food.

1217
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,240
There is not any law that says

1218
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,040
that you have to get them
from supplementation.

1219
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,530
Supplementation can help you get

1220
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,560
to the very high levels of those things,

1221
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,380
if you want to work on the higher end,

1222
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,350
if that's right for you.

1223
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,580
Obviously, check with your
doctor before taking anything

1224
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,350
or removing anything from your
diet or supplement regime.

1225
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,773
But in general, you can get
these things from foods.

1226
00:48:00,773 --> 00:48:04,700
It's just so happens, that
for some of these compounds,

1227
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,310
the foods that they're
contained in, like fish,

1228
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,040
are not foods that I particularly enjoy,

1229
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,220
and so I rely on [clears
throat], excuse me,

1230
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,720
I rely on supplements in order to get

1231
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,190
sufficient levels for me.

1232
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,630
But again, you can get
these levels from food.

1233
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,550
And the reason I made this list,

1234
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,270
the reason that I emphasize these things

1235
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,080
in this particular order,

1236
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,000
is that they support the
structure of neurons.

1237
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,830
They support the structure of
the other cells of the brain

1238
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:33,977
that make up our cognition

1239
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,150
and that are important for our focus,

1240
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,920
and our ability to remember
things, and so forth.

1241
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,010
And they are less so in the category

1242
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,330
of so-called modulatory effects.

1243
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,330
They will also have
modulatory effects on sleep,

1244
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,163
on inflammation,

1245
00:48:48,163 --> 00:48:49,970
or reducing inflammation
throughout the body,

1246
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,690
on cardiovascular function,

1247
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:55,420
all of which I believe
are positive affects.

1248
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,130
At least what the literature tells us,

1249
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,580
is that none of these compounds

1250
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,510
are harming other systems of the body,

1251
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,120
provided they are taken
at reasonable levels.

1252
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,250
But everything in this
list is directed towards

1253
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,290
answering the question, what can I eat,

1254
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,040
what can I ingest by way of
food, and/or food supplement,

1255
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,800
that can support brain
function in the short-term

1256
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,750
and in the long-term?

1257
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,630
So I hope you find that
list beneficial for you.

1258
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,960
If not for use, at
least for consideration.

1259
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,460
So now, having talked
about some of the foods

1260
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,130
and micronutrients that are
beneficial to our immediate

1261
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,520
and long-term brain health,

1262
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,060
I'd like to shift gears somewhat,

1263
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,880
and talk about why it is

1264
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,420
that we like the foods that we like.

1265
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,480
We've all heard before

1266
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,560
that we are hardwired to pursue sugar,

1267
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,777
and to like fatty foods,

1268
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:45,130
and that calorie-rich
foods are attractive to us

1269
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,140
for all sorts of reasons,

1270
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,680
you know, surviving famines,
and things of that sort.

1271
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,110
And while that is true,

1272
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,030
the actual mechanisms that underlie

1273
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,350
food seeking and food preference

1274
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,290
are far more interesting than that.

1275
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,380
There are basically three channels

1276
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,840
in our body and nervous system

1277
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,520
by which we decide what foods to pursue,

1278
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,020
how much to eat, and
whether or not we will find

1279
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,760
a particular food attractive,

1280
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,190
whether or not we will
want to consume more of it,

1281
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,390
whether or not we want to avoid it,

1282
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:16,510
or whether or not it's just sort of so-so,

1283
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:21,510
what I refer to as the
yum, yuck, or meh analysis.

1284
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,530
And indeed, that's what
our nervous system is doing

1285
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,510
with respect to food.

1286
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,730
It's trying to figure out whether or not,

1287
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,890
yum, I want more of this,

1288
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,900
yuck, I want to avoid this,

1289
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,870
or meh, it's so-so.

1290
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,210
Now, while that may seem like

1291
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,260
a overly simplified
version of food seeking

1292
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,670
and food preference,

1293
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,100
it's actually not that far from the truth.

1294
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,820
It actually correctly captures

1295
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,280
much of the biology of food preference.

1296
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,220
So let's talk about what
these three channels

1297
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,080
for food preference are.

1298
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,130
The first one is an obvious one.

1299
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,190
It's taste on the mouth.

1300
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:59,430
It is the sensation that we
have of the foods that we eat

1301
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,910
while we're chewing them,

1302
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,380
and those sensations,

1303
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,350
which are literally just
somatosensory, touch sensations,

1304
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,750
you know, the palatability of food

1305
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,320
as it relates to the consistency
of food, that's important.

1306
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,070
And as you've all heard before,

1307
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,600
we have sensors on our tongue

1308
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,340
and elsewhere in our mouth

1309
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,410
that detect the various
chemicals contained within food,

1310
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,600
and lead to the senses of taste,

1311
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,240
which we call bitter, sweet,
umami, salty, and sour.

1312
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,940
Now, most of us are familiar
with the sense of bitterness

1313
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,810
that comes from something
like a raw radish,

1314
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:35,380
sweet, which comes, obviously,

1315
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,730
from sugars of different kinds,

1316
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,940
fructose, glucose, et cetera,

1317
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,210
salty, salty,

1318
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:46,070
and sour, think lemon or
lemon juice, for instance.

1319
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,040
And then I mentioned umami.

1320
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,550
The umami receptor is a
receptor that responds

1321
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,740
to the savory taste of things.

1322
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,200
So that's what you might find in a really

1323
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,510
wonderfully rich tomato sauce.

1324
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,500
For those of you that
eat meat, and like meat,

1325
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,950
a really well cooked ,not
necessarily well done,

1326
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:08,580
but properly cooked, I should say, steak,

1327
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,840
if that's your thing.

1328
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,550
And umami is present in
both plant and animal foods,

1329
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,360
and gives us that sensation of savoriness.

1330
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,820
It almost has a kind of little
bit of a briny taste to it,

1331
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,450
or braised taste to it.

1332
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,310
And indeed, brazing of meats
and brazing of vegetables

1333
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,620
is done specifically to
activate that umami receptor.

1334
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,690
So we have those five basic tastes.

1335
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,970
Those are chemical sensors
on the tongue that,

1336
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,480
what we call, transduce those chemicals.

1337
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,860
Those chemicals, literally, in
food bind to those receptors,

1338
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,763
and it is transduced,

1339
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,890
meaning the binding of those
chemicals to the receptors

1340
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,000
is converted into an electrical signal

1341
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,800
that travels in from the tongue

1342
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,980
along what's called the gustatory nerve.

1343
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,070
The gustatory nerve then synapses,

1344
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,360
meaning it makes
connections in our brainstem

1345
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,970
in the so-called nucleus
of the solitary tract.

1346
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,620
There are other nuclei back there.

1347
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,610
Nuclei just aggregates of neurons.

1348
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,280
And then it sends information up to

1349
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,610
the so-called insular
cortex, to the insula.

1350
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:11,680
I want to highlight the
insula this episode,

1351
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,720
because we are going
to return to the insula

1352
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,500
again and again in this
episode, and later.

1353
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,530
The insular cortex is
a incredible structure

1354
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,720
that we all have

1355
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,520
that mainly is concerned
with so-called interoception,

1356
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,840
or our perception of what's
going on inside our body.

1357
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,500
So it could be the amount
of pressure in our gut

1358
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,240
because of how much food we've eaten.

1359
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,460
It could be the acidity of our gut,

1360
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,860
if we're having a little bit
of indigestion, for instance.

1361
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,520
It can also be the case,

1362
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,610
that neurons within the
insula are paying attention

1363
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,700
to how stressed you are,
or how alert you are,

1364
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,800
or how tired you are.

1365
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,960
So it's really an inward
focusing structure.

1366
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,040
It focuses on how we feel internally.

1367
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,250
And not surprisingly,

1368
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,210
the taste system sends information
up to the insular cortex

1369
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,710
to give us a sense, literally,
of what we've ingested,

1370
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:06,080
whether or not what we're
tasting tastes good or not.

1371
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,130
We will return to insular
cortex in a few moments.

1372
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,290
A very important thing to understand,

1373
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,050
is that the neurons in
the areas of the cortex,

1374
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,000
your cortex and mine, that
respond to particular tastes

1375
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,980
are providing an internal representation

1376
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,880
of an external sense.

1377
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,850
What do I mean by that?

1378
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,810
I don't want to be at all abstract.

1379
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,810
We take these foods,

1380
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,730
we break them down in our
mouth by chewing them,

1381
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:33,563
or sucking on them,

1382
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:35,950
whatever it is the food happens to be,

1383
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,650
those chemicals bind to those receptors,

1384
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,010
and electrical signals
are sent into the brain,

1385
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,670
but they are just electrical signals,

1386
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,040
just like notes being played
on the keys of a piano.

1387
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,090
There's no unique signature
for salty or sweet.

1388
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:53,090
It is the relative activation
of one set of neurons

1389
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,930
that was activated by sweet,

1390
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,570
or another set of neurons
that was activated by umami.

1391
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,510
It's that relative activation

1392
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:04,090
traveling into the brain in,
essentially, the same form,

1393
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,550
the same electrical signals.

1394
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,610
This is really incredible, right?

1395
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:07,990
Electrical signals are
sent into the brain,

1396
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:11,000
and you say, aha, that's
sweet and I want more of it,

1397
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,550
or that's bitter, or I want less of it,

1398
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,790
or that's umami flavored,

1399
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,410
and I really, really like that,

1400
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,883
really like savory foods, as I happen to.

1401
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,000
That should immediately
strike you as incredible,

1402
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,040
because it means that your representation

1403
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,310
of what you want more of or
less of is electrical in nature.

1404
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:31,090
And to really tamp this issue down,

1405
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:36,030
studies that were done by
Charles Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R...

1406
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,160
He's a absolutely
phenomenal neuroscientist

1407
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,130
at Columbia University in New York.

1408
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,040
Studies done by the Zuker
Lab have shown that,

1409
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,440
first of all, they could identify
the neurons in the cortex

1410
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,420
deep in the brain that
respond to a sweet taste

1411
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,400
or to a bitter taste.

1412
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,900
It turns out, they are non-overlapping

1413
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,510
populations of neurons.

1414
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,070
And then using some molecular tricks,

1415
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,660
they were able to either silence

1416
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,300
or activate the neurons
that, for instance,

1417
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,823
respond to sweet.

1418
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,283
When they do this,

1419
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:14,350
they see incredible
consequences on perception

1420
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,950
that, indeed, occur in your brain,

1421
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,730
and my brain as well, all the time

1422
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,220
without these kind of manipulations.

1423
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,320
Here's the experiment.

1424
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:27,270
They have a subject drink
water that contains sugar,

1425
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,670
or drink water that
contains a salty substance,

1426
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:30,920
or drink water that contains

1427
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,670
a bitter substance, for instance.

1428
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,090
Okay, I'm sort of paraphrasing
a large amount of work.

1429
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,953
They identify the neurons
that respond to sweet tastes.

1430
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,780
They see, as many researchers have seen,

1431
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,950
that subjects prefer sweet
taste to other tastes,

1432
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,520
and certainly, sweet tastes to bitter,

1433
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,093
or sweet tastes to
nothing, so to plain water.

1434
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,860
And then they go in,

1435
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,690
and they are able to
selectively silence the neurons

1436
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,173
that represent sweet.

1437
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,290
And when they do that,

1438
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,123
they eliminate the preference
for that sweet taste.

1439
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,610
Now, that might seem obvious,

1440
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,680
the neurons respond to sweet,

1441
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,700
and you silence those neurons,

1442
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,640
they no longer seek out sweet.

1443
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,780
But that should strike
you, also, as incredible,

1444
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,300
because they're not actually changing

1445
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,530
what's happening on the tongue

1446
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,380
or in the deeper layers of the brain.

1447
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,640
Conversely, they can have
subjects drink bitter water

1448
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,780
or plain water while activating,

1449
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,190
selectively activating, the
neurons that respond to sweet.

1450
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,400
And what they find,

1451
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,400
is that then subjects will
actively prefer bitter

1452
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:45,700
or plain water to actual
preferences, such as sweet.

1453
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,210
So what this means is that,

1454
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:51,450
your perception of what
you like is a central,

1455
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,520
meaning deep within the brain, phenomenon.

1456
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,530
It's not about how things
taste on your mouth.

1457
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,240
Now, of course, under normal conditions,

1458
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,073
where there aren't these

1459
00:58:00,073 --> 00:58:02,360
experimental manipulations being done,

1460
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,490
those things are positively correlated.

1461
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,340
Sweet tastes trigger the activation

1462
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,180
of sweet neurons, for instance.

1463
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,800
Neurons in the mouth
that respond to umami,

1464
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,920
trigger the activation
of neurons in the brain

1465
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,720
that respond to umami, and so forth.

1466
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,510
So they're correlated in a way

1467
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:20,020
that makes you seek out
the things that you like,

1468
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,260
and avoid the things that you don't like.

1469
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,760
But as we'll see in a few minutes,

1470
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,100
turns out, that that is
not a direct relationship

1471
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,520
that is hardwired.

1472
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,540
You can actually uncouple

1473
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,870
the preference for a particular taste

1474
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,430
with the reward systems in the brain

1475
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,400
in a way that, for instance,

1476
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,940
would allow you to eat,

1477
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,390
or I should use myself as an example,

1478
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,830
'cause I don't particularly like fish.

1479
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:46,240
I've had a few meals that include a fish

1480
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,510
that were pretty good,

1481
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,230
but none of them were memorable

1482
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,300
in the kind of positive way,

1483
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,000
that like some other events
in my life were memorable.

1484
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:55,850
But by way of these circuitries,

1485
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,300
and the way they link up with one another,

1486
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,380
it's actually possible to
rewire one's sense of taste

1487
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,230
and preference for particular foods.

1488
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,830
If this is seeming at all vague to you,

1489
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,250
just hang in with me a little bit longer,

1490
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,240
because I will provide you
with the information, tools,

1491
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,130
and resources with which
to navigate this process.

1492
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:16,820
But the most important
thing to understand is that,

1493
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,010
like with our hearing,

1494
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,333
like with vision,

1495
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:22,823
like with smell,

1496
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,690
taste is an internal representation

1497
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:31,830
that has particular goals for you.

1498
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,170
Your sense of what tastes good

1499
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,870
is related to particular things

1500
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,550
that are occurring in your brain and body,

1501
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,740
and that are likely to give your brain

1502
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,530
and body the things that it needs.

1503
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:43,230
It is not simply a matter of

1504
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,560
what you, quote/unquote, "like",

1505
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,190
or what tastes good, or
what doesn't taste good.

1506
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,150
Let me give you a
relatively simple example

1507
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,260
of how your body and your brain are acting

1508
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,850
in a coordinated way

1509
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:55,754
to make you prefer certain foods,

1510
00:59:55,754 --> 00:59:59,393
and indeed, to pursue certain foods more.

1511
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,540
As I just mentioned, you
have neurons on your tongue

1512
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,290
that respond to different tastes.

1513
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:06,930
But, of course, your digestive
tract isn't just your tongue,

1514
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:07,930
it's also your throat.

1515
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,910
It goes all the way down to your stomach,

1516
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,140
and, of course, your intestines.

1517
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,743
It's a long tube of digestion.

1518
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,690
All along that tube there are neurons.

1519
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,200
Some of the neurons are responding to

1520
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,400
the mechanical size of

1521
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,690
whatever portion of the
digestive tract it happens to be.

1522
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,750
So for instance, how distended,
or empty, or full, rather,

1523
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,634
it doesn't have to be distended,

1524
01:00:30,634 --> 01:00:31,610
it depends on how much you ate,

1525
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,860
but how full or empty
your gut happens to be,

1526
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,420
whether or not something you
just ate is temperature hot,

1527
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,120
you know, is hot in the
sense of hot to the touch,

1528
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,980
or whether or not it's spicy hot,

1529
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,250
whether or not it's soothing,

1530
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,690
whether or not it's
kind of hard to swallow,

1531
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:47,600
this kind of thing.

1532
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,570
So you have neurons all along your gut

1533
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,510
that are responding to the mechanics

1534
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,050
related to food and digestion,

1535
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,050
and that are related to the
chemistry of food and digestion.

1536
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,610
There's a population of neurons,

1537
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,430
nerve cells in your gut,

1538
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:04,210
that are exquisitely
tuned to the chemistry

1539
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,210
of whatever it is in your gut.

1540
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:09,600
And these are neurons
called neuropod cells.

1541
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,510
They were discovered many, many years ago,

1542
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,600
but really defined with

1543
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,710
and classified with modern tools

1544
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,170
by Diego Bohorquez.

1545
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,870
I hope I'm pronouncing
your name correctly.

1546
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,510
Diego, we've spoken many times,

1547
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,160
but I can't ever seem to quite capture

1548
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,280
the proper pronunciation just right.

1549
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,660
But Diego Bohorquez at Duke University,

1550
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,250
who discovered that these cells

1551
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,470
reside within the gut,

1552
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:37,050
and place little processes,

1553
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,630
they're little axons and dendrites,

1554
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:43,100
within the mucosal lining of the gut.

1555
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,840
And there, they are paying attention to,

1556
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,600
meaning they respond to,

1557
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,800
amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids.

1558
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,030
So as your food is digested,

1559
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:57,220
as food lands within your gut,

1560
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,980
neurons there are sensing what
types of foods are available,

1561
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,480
and what types of things
are making their way

1562
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,050
through the gut environment.

1563
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,277
Now, those neurons aren't
actually taking those foods

1564
01:02:08,277 --> 01:02:09,430
and doing much with them.

1565
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,680
What they're doing, is they're essentially

1566
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:16,670
surveying what qualities
of food are there.

1567
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,260
And these particular neurons

1568
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,010
that Diego and his group discovered,

1569
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:24,680
send electrical signals up into the brain

1570
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,680
through a little passage that
we call the nodose ganglion.

1571
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,280
The nodose ganglion is
a cluster of neurons

1572
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,710
that then send up their
own process into the brain,

1573
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,350
and trigger the release of dopamine,

1574
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:40,200
which is a molecule that
inspires motivation, reward,

1575
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,323
and more seeking for whatever
it is led to their activation.

1576
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,870
These are super interesting neurons,

1577
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,980
because what they're essentially doing,

1578
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:53,350
is they are providing
a subconscious signal

1579
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,700
about the quality of the
food that you're eating,

1580
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,950
what it contains,

1581
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,550
and then triggering the release

1582
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:01,420
of a molecule within your brain, dopamine,

1583
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,173
that leads you to go
seek more of those foods.

1584
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:09,940
Now, this has profound
impact on a number of things.

1585
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,520
First of all,

1586
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,370
there's the consideration
of so-called hidden sugars.

1587
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,460
Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a
pediatric endocrinologist

1588
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,780
at University of
California, San Francisco,

1589
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,220
has been among the most
prominent researchers

1590
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,230
to talk about the fact

1591
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,460
that there are these so-called
hidden sugars in foods.

1592
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:27,820
Now, these are not just sugars,

1593
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,430
that they sneak in just to be sneaky,

1594
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,890
these are sugars that
are literally snuck in

1595
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:35,520
in a way that you can't taste them.

1596
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,170
That's why they're called hidden sugars.

1597
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,200
It's not that they just
put them in there for fun.

1598
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,780
These are sugars that are
placed into processed foods

1599
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,010
that are designed to trigger activation

1600
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,890
of these mechanisms

1601
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,110
to lead you to want to
eat more of these foods,

1602
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:54,300
but not because they necessarily
taste sweet or delicious,

1603
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,290
but because they are activating

1604
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,580
these subconscious mechanisms

1605
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,100
that are driving you to
pursue more of these foods.

1606
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,000
It sounds like a very diabolical strategy,

1607
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,623
and indeed, it is somewhat
of a diabolical strategy.

1608
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,470
However, these neurons are also involved

1609
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,630
in signaling to your
brain when, for instance,

1610
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:15,510
you are eating a food that is
rich in omega-3 fatty acids,

1611
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:17,860
the fatty acids that we
were talking about earlier.

1612
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,870
So why is it that you don't crave salmon?

1613
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,300
Why is it that I don't sit around

1614
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,030
daydreaming about mackerel?

1615
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,870
Well, because there's also the influence

1616
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,630
of the actual taste on the mouth.

1617
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:27,660
Under normal conditions,

1618
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,450
it's a combination of the taste
of the thing on the mouth,

1619
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,090
plus the subconscious
signaling from the gut.

1620
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,310
And while this isn't a
discussion about gut microbiome,

1621
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,170
I should just mention,
that it's very clear

1622
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,640
that having a healthy gut microbiome

1623
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,320
allows these neurons to function in a way

1624
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,890
that serves our seeking of
healthy foods in positive ways.

1625
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,550
And without getting into a
lot of detail about this,

1626
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,100
the best way to ensure
a healthy gut microbiome

1627
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,880
that I am aware of

1628
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,590
is not necessarily

1629
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:03,280
to take supplemental
prebiotics or probiotics.

1630
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,390
There are actually some reasons why

1631
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,240
you might not want to do that.

1632
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,510
But rather, to ingest two to four servings

1633
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,363
of fermented foods that
are low in sugar each day.

1634
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,100
There is a recent study published in Cell

1635
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,720
showing that the ingestion
of fermented foods,

1636
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,163
two to four servings each day,

1637
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:24,920
can enhance the quality of
the mucosal lining of the gut

1638
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,420
that allows certain gut
microbiota to flourish,

1639
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,140
and the gut microbiota
that are not good for us

1640
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,973
to not flourish,

1641
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:33,900
'cause that's the environment
that they settle down into.

1642
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,450
This is work that was carried out

1643
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:38,330
by my colleagues, Justin Sonnenburg,

1644
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,970
which is in the laboratory
upstairs from me,

1645
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,673
as well as Chris Gardner,
and others at Stanford.

1646
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,940
They are certainly not the only
researchers exploring this.

1647
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,070
But it does appear,

1648
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,830
that two to four servings of

1649
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,280
fermented foods each day,

1650
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,250
so these would be things
like natto, sauerkraut,

1651
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:59,410
low sugar fermented foods, is
great for the gut microbiome.

1652
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:01,480
And separate studies, not their study,

1653
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,610
but separate studies have shown

1654
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:05,610
that the correct gut microbiome conditions

1655
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,850
allow these neurons
that signal to the brain

1656
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:10,350
to signal the right, at the right times,

1657
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:13,710
and in the right ways to
promote healthy food seeking.

1658
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:18,500
Many people opt to supplement
with capsule form probiotics.

1659
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,010
There are some data that suggests

1660
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,380
that maybe those don't
contain the correct prebiotics

1661
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,990
and probiotics for setting the correct

1662
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,930
gut microbiota conditions.

1663
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:31,700
That's a little bit of
a controversial issue.

1664
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:36,320
Nonetheless, getting
probiotics from fermented foods

1665
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,480
is probably the simplest and
most straightforward way.

1666
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,690
It's also the way that we
evolved to do that over many,

1667
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,290
at least hundreds, and
probably, thousands,

1668
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,170
or even tens or hundreds
of thousands of years,

1669
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:47,360
people have been
ingesting fermented foods,

1670
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,230
not just for their tastes,

1671
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,550
but for their health benefits as well.

1672
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:53,470
So now I've mentioned two
of the three mechanisms

1673
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,940
by which we prefer certain foods.

1674
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:58,757
One is from the actual taste
that we're familiar with,

1675
01:06:58,757 --> 01:07:00,820
the taste on our tongue, and in our mouth,

1676
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:05,300
in the sensations that make
us go mmm, or ugh, or eh,

1677
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,380
the yum, yuk, meh responses,
as I referred to them earlier.

1678
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,380
And then there's this
subconscious signaling

1679
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,213
coming from the gut

1680
01:07:11,213 --> 01:07:13,970
that's really based on the
nutrient content of the foods.

1681
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,550
There's a third pathway,

1682
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,570
which is the learned association
of a particular taste

1683
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:25,960
with the particular quality
or value that a food has.

1684
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,040
And this is where things
get really interesting,

1685
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,190
and where there's
actually a leverage point

1686
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,200
for you to rewire

1687
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,546
what it is that you find tasty,

1688
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:37,680
and that you want to seek more of.

1689
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,060
The work I'd like to talk about next

1690
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,500
has been carried out in mouse models,

1691
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:46,320
and has been carried out in
parallel experiments in humans.

1692
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,390
This is largely, not exclusively,

1693
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:53,390
but largely the work of Ivan
de Araujo and Dana Small.

1694
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,740
Ivan de Araujo is at Mount
Sinai School of Medicine.

1695
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,930
And Dana Small is at Yale.

1696
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,810
And they, and others in their field,

1697
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,890
have done incredible experiments

1698
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:08,320
exploring how taste and food value,

1699
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,360
the nutritional value of food,

1700
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:15,160
and the impact of that food
on metabolism in the brain

1701
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,020
drives our food choices,

1702
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,270
and allows us to change our
food choices for the better.

1703
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,189
Their groups have done
some really amazing studies

1704
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:26,839
involving ingestion of
a particular substance

1705
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,939
that either contains sugar,

1706
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,919
and thereby, can elevate
glucose, blood sugar, or not.

1707
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,460
And varying, meaning
changing the taste associated

1708
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,170
with that ingestion of sugar.

1709
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:43,300
So let me just give you a simple example

1710
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,819
where they have subjects,

1711
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:47,459
these could be mice or
these could be humans,

1712
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:50,330
'cause they've done both sets of studies,

1713
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,790
drink sweet water as an alternative

1714
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:58,399
or a choice to non-sweetened
water, or bitter water,

1715
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,639
or some other flavor.

1716
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,040
And what they find, is that
mice and humans will prefer

1717
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,100
to consume the sweet beverage.

1718
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,529
Now, it's not always sweet water.

1719
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:07,539
Mice like sweet water,

1720
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,340
but humans will prefer,
for instance, a milkshake,

1721
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,763
a fatty sweet drink.

1722
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,739
They'll consume more of that,

1723
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,140
and not surprisingly,

1724
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,783
dopamine levels in the brain
increase in response to that.

1725
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:26,670
So the taste and the nutrient content

1726
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:29,670
of what it is that they're
ingesting are aligned.

1727
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,633
They are matched.

1728
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,350
They've also done experiments
where they have no taste,

1729
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:39,260
but subjects are being infused with sugar

1730
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,229
directly into the gut.

1731
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:43,079
And not surprisingly,

1732
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,140
based on everything I've
told you up until now,

1733
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,979
subjects will pursue more of that thing

1734
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:51,649
relative to some other taste,

1735
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,330
either neutral or negative taste,

1736
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,490
because that sugar in the gut

1737
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:57,680
is triggering the activation

1738
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,930
of the neurons I mentioned earlier,

1739
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,100
which is signaling to the brain

1740
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,970
to pursue more of that thing.

1741
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,510
So this tells us something important.

1742
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,110
It tells us that we are driven,

1743
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,220
meaning we have mechanisms in our brain

1744
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,160
that make us motivated to pursue

1745
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,400
more of what brings both
a taste of sweetness,

1746
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,710
but also that brings actual changes

1747
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,760
in blood glucose levels up, okay?

1748
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,610
So we are motivated to eat sweet things

1749
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,080
not just because they taste good,

1750
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,870
but because they change
our blood sugar level.

1751
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:26,970
They increase our blood sugar level.

1752
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:27,910
This is important,

1753
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,490
because it needn't be the case.

1754
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,450
It could have been that we were just wired

1755
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,340
to pursue things that taste good.

1756
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,220
But what this tells us,

1757
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:38,300
is that we are actually
wired to pursue things

1758
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,283
that increase our blood glucose,

1759
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:46,470
so much so that when the small lab...

1760
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,553
It's not a small lab.

1761
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:48,386
It's actually a big lab.

1762
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:52,510
But when Dana Small's lab,
and/or Ivan de Araujo's lab,

1763
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:53,620
have done experiments

1764
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:58,320
where they use a compound
called 2-deoxyglucose,

1765
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
this is a compound that

1766
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,990
can prevent glucose from
being metabolized by neurons.

1767
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,270
So blood glucose is going up,

1768
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,000
but neurons can't use it.

1769
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,080
What they find, is that the reinforcing

1770
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,530
or the rewarding properties of a food

1771
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:14,350
or taste are eliminated.

1772
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:17,670
Put simply, it is not
sufficient for a food

1773
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,370
to taste good consciously.

1774
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:24,730
It is not sufficient for a
food to increase blood sugar.

1775
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,350
You need blood sugar to go up,

1776
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,720
and that blood sugar glucose

1777
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,053
has to be utilized by the neurons,

1778
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:36,400
even if it's not associated
with a good taste.

1779
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,080
And to make it even simpler,

1780
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,900
if this isn't sinking in,

1781
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,610
this should make it very clear.

1782
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,160
What your brain,

1783
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,360
meaning, what you are seeking
when you eat, is not taste,

1784
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,200
is not dopamine,

1785
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,650
is not even a rise in blood glucose.

1786
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,240
What you're seeking, even
though you don't realize it,

1787
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,110
because it's subconscious,

1788
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,740
is you are seeking things
that allow your neurons

1789
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,920
to be metabolically active.

1790
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,660
And this is fundamentally important

1791
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,070
for understanding why you eat,

1792
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,990
why you eat particular foods,

1793
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:11,890
and how you can change your
relationship to those foods.

1794
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:14,070
Now, earlier, I referred to circuits

1795
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,870
that are wired for a particular outcome.

1796
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,140
And in biology, and in
particular, neuroscience,

1797
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,040
we refer to things that
are either hard-wired,

1798
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,173
meaning immutable, and
unchangeable, or soft-wired.

1799
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:28,320
A good example of soft-wiring would be

1800
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,200
the areas of your brain that
are responsible for speech

1801
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:35,950
and language are always, more or less,

1802
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:39,500
in the same place in your brain
and everyone else's brain.

1803
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,450
However, they are not
hard-wired to speak French,

1804
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,250
or to speak English, or to speak Chinese,

1805
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,800
or to speak German,

1806
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,630
because depending on where you were born,

1807
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,640
and the parents that you're born to,

1808
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,002
you need to be able to speak one

1809
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:54,830
or maybe even more languages.

1810
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,040
The taste system,

1811
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,320
and this general system of
seeking particular foods,

1812
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,840
similarly is hard-wired to obtain

1813
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,210
certain types of nutrients.

1814
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,730
It tends to like sweet things.

1815
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,550
Most children naturally like sweet things,

1816
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,890
some more than others.

1817
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:12,500
But naturally, most people
from childhood onward

1818
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,140
don't particularly crave
very bitter substances.

1819
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,380
Maybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter.

1820
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,670
So there's some hard-wiring of preference,

1821
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,300
but there's also some
soft-wiring in the system

1822
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,653
that allows it to change.

1823
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,220
The groups I mentioned earlier

1824
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,220
have done some really
beautiful experiments

1825
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,120
looking at how artificial sweeteners

1826
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,480
interact with the actual
sweet sensing system.

1827
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,110
And this gets right down
to a number of issues.

1828
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,060
First of all, it gets to the issue of

1829
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,707
how we can rewire our taste system

1830
01:13:41,707 --> 01:13:44,940
in ways that serve us
for better or for worse.

1831
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:47,520
Second of all, it gets
right down to the issue

1832
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,620
of whether or not artificial sweeteners

1833
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,510
are good for us or bad for us.

1834
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,720
And indeed, as of just this last year,

1835
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,000
we know an answer to that question,

1836
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,060
and turns out, it depends.

1837
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,500
And I will tell you in a few minutes

1838
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,160
when it is okay to ingest
artificial sweeteners,

1839
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,000
and when it is very detrimental

1840
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,373
to ingest artificial
sweeteners of any kind.

1841
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,130
Regardless, I'm not going
to name off brand names,

1842
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:14,440
but there are different forms of these

1843
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,990
artificial sweeteners nowadays.

1844
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,600
And there are various forms

1845
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,240
of non-caloric plant-based sweeteners

1846
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,670
for which the same information

1847
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,960
that I'm about to tell you applies.

1848
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,030
Okay.

1849
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,900
So the experiments that were done

1850
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,370
beautifully illustrate that
you seek out particular foods

1851
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,300
because of the way they taste,

1852
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,380
because of their impact
on blood glucose levels,

1853
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,610
but also on their impact
on the dopamine system,

1854
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,240
even if your blood glucose
levels don't change.

1855
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,053
So here's the experiment.

1856
01:14:45,053 --> 01:14:47,870
One group of subjects
is given a sweet taste

1857
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,460
of a substance that also raises

1858
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,330
blood glucose levels, blood sugar,

1859
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:53,663
and dopamine goes up, not surprisingly.

1860
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,000
The second condition,

1861
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,290
separate subjects consume
an artificial sweetener

1862
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,230
or a non-caloric sweetener.

1863
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,610
It is not preferred much
over other substances,

1864
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:07,600
but it is sweet, so
it's preferred somewhat.

1865
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,723
And it does not cause an
increase in blood glucose levels,

1866
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:15,400
and not surprisingly,
dopamine levels don't go up.

1867
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,390
So initially, we don't tend to like

1868
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:18,710
artificial sweeteners that much.

1869
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:20,090
That's the simple way of putting it.

1870
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,820
However, if subjects continue

1871
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:24,533
to ingest artificial sweeteners,

1872
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,690
even though there's no increase
in blood glucose level,

1873
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,040
and therefore, no increase
in brain metabolism,

1874
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,250
dopamine levels eventually start to rise.

1875
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,560
And when those dopamine levels
eventually start to rise,

1876
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,780
you've essentially conditioned

1877
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:43,780
or reinforced that artificial
or non-caloric sweetener,

1878
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,880
and then subjects start
to consume more of it,

1879
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,693
and they actually get a
dopamine increase from it.

1880
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,413
So that's interesting.

1881
01:15:50,413 --> 01:15:52,820
It says that, consuming more
of these artificial sweeteners,

1882
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:55,150
or consuming them for a
longer period of time,

1883
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,020
can start to tap into the dopamine system,

1884
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,150
and lead us to seek out

1885
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,910
or consume more of these
artificial sweeteners.

1886
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,050
Many people are probably
familiar with this,

1887
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,680
because we tend to,

1888
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,100
or I should say, people report,

1889
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,120
that when they ingest these
artificial sweeteners,

1890
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,310
at first, they don't taste very good,

1891
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,440
but then, over time, they
seem kind of tolerable,

1892
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,397
and then maybe even pleasureful,

1893
01:16:12,397 --> 01:16:14,037
and then some people feel, quote/unquote,

1894
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:18,010
"addicted" to various diet
sodas, and things of that sort.

1895
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:21,930
Now, there's another condition
that's been explored,

1896
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:23,860
and that's the really
interesting condition,

1897
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,740
and it's the condition where
an artificial sweetener

1898
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:31,270
is paired with a substance
that can increase blood sugar,

1899
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,750
but not because it tastes sugary,

1900
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:35,000
like a normal sweet substance.

1901
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,810
So now, there's an artificial sweetener

1902
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:42,120
that's coupled with an actual
increase in blood glucose.

1903
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,180
The natural world scenario
where this would happen

1904
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,550
would be drinking a diet soda
which contains no calories,

1905
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,260
and therefore, would not
increase blood glucose,

1906
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:54,623
but is sweet, with a food
that increases blood glucose.

1907
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,370
And when that happens,

1908
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,330
what you're essentially doing,

1909
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:00,060
is tapping into the dopamine system.

1910
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:04,030
This non-caloric sweet
taste is paired with it,

1911
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:07,580
and there's an increase
in neuron metabolism.

1912
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,490
So you have all of the
components for reinforcement.

1913
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,430
And as a consequence,

1914
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,268
you get in a sort of
Pavlovian conditioning way,

1915
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:17,810
a situation where, later,

1916
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:20,640
when you ingest that artificial sweetener,

1917
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,790
you actually get not only
the increase in dopamine,

1918
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:27,290
but you get alterations
in blood sugar management.

1919
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,480
Now, blood sugar cannot go up

1920
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,630
if you don't ingest something
that makes blood sugar go up.

1921
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:35,190
So it's not as if you
ingest artificial sweetener

1922
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:38,420
with some food that
contains calories or sugar,

1923
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,430
and then later, you remove the food,

1924
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,820
and you just drink the soda,

1925
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,330
and your blood glucose goes up.

1926
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:47,653
Rather, it's a much worse situation.

1927
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,800
I'll make this in the
natural world context.

1928
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,440
If you ingest an artificial sweetener,

1929
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,930
say, drink diet soda while consuming foods

1930
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,783
that increase blood glucose,

1931
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:04,150
then later, even if you
just drink the diet soda,

1932
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:08,100
it's been shown that you
secrete much more insulin,

1933
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,970
the hormone that regulates blood glucose,

1934
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,140
in response to that diet soda.

1935
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,110
Studies have been done
in both adult humans

1936
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:17,660
and in human children.

1937
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,940
In general, when we say children,

1938
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:19,773
we mean human children,

1939
01:18:19,773 --> 01:18:22,460
but just to be very clear
what we're talking about.

1940
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,700
Exploring consuming diet
soda with or without food,

1941
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,820
then later, consuming just the diet soda.

1942
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,960
And what they found was,

1943
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,020
having previously consumed
diet soda with food,

1944
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,683
and then later, only
consuming the diet soda,

1945
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,920
of course, there isn't an
increase in blood glucose,

1946
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,620
because they're not
bringing in any calories

1947
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,480
when they just drink the diet soda,

1948
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,980
but there is a significant
increase in insulin release,

1949
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:50,380
and that is serious in a terrible way,

1950
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,330
because increased release of insulin,

1951
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:54,290
and so-called insulin sensitivity,

1952
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,810
is the basis for type 2 diabetes.

1953
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:00,320
So much so, that in the
study with the children,

1954
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,053
consuming non-caloric
beverages in this way,

1955
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,080
first with food, and then on their own,

1956
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,170
led to increases in insulin
that made them pre-diabetic,

1957
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,320
and they actually had to halt the study.

1958
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,427
So I want to zoom out from this,

1959
01:19:14,427 --> 01:19:16,820
and just really illustrate
the major findings,

1960
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,930
and then talk about
how this can be applied

1961
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:19,780
in the positive sense.

1962
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,380
I also want to mention what this means

1963
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,970
in terms of your consumption

1964
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,490
of artificial sweeteners of any kind.

1965
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,430
So first of all,

1966
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:29,920
the direct takeaway about
artificial sweeteners.

1967
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,620
Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.

1968
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,280
I'm not going to say that.

1969
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,360
What I am going to say,

1970
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,380
is that whether or not
you ingest them alone,

1971
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,760
or you ingest them in
combination with food,

1972
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,210
or as part of foods that
raise blood glucose,

1973
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:47,020
is vitally important for
your insulin management.

1974
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:50,800
And the simple extractor
tool from this is,

1975
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,204
if you are going to consume
artificial sweeteners,

1976
01:19:53,204 --> 01:19:56,510
it's very likely best to consume those

1977
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,660
away from any food that
raises blood glucose levels.

1978
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:04,220
So if you're going to enjoy
diet soda, be my guest,

1979
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,180
but do it not while consuming food,

1980
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,460
in particular, foods
that raise blood glucose.

1981
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,210
Because what these studies show,

1982
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:13,120
and I will provide references for these,

1983
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,800
is that they can vastly disrupt

1984
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,560
blood sugar management by way of

1985
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,690
the insulin glucose system, okay?

1986
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,830
And actually, I'll just
give you the reference now.

1987
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,460
This is a paper from Dana Small's lab.

1988
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:30,130
The first author is
Dalenburg, D-A-L-E-N-B-U-R-G.

1989
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,547
And the title of the paper is

1990
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:33,447
"Short-term Consumption of Sucralose With,

1991
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:34,940
nut Not Without Carbohydrate,

1992
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,380
Impairs Neural and Metabolic Sensitivity

1993
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,740
to Sugar in Humans".

1994
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,590
This is a paper published
in "Cell Metabolism"

1995
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,810
in March of 2020.

1996
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,000
I think it's a very important paper.

1997
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,450
And similar findings have
been addressed in mice,

1998
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,283
and in other studies.

1999
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:50,580
And now, because of this paper,

2000
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:54,970
there's now a bunch of other
groups working on this issue.

2001
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:58,610
There's some evidence previously
published in "Nature",

2002
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:00,860
an excellent top-tier journal.

2003
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,740
Sort of among the Superbowl
of top three journals,

2004
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,060
being "Nature", "Science", and "Cell".

2005
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,870
A paper published in
"Nature" a few years back

2006
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:11,000
showing that particular
artificial sweeteners

2007
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,760
can disrupt the gut microbiome,

2008
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,573
and have deleterious health effects.

2009
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,190
That result, I think, stands,

2010
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,450
although, there are some results

2011
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,030
that may not agree with that,

2012
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,840
depending on whether or not
the artificial sweetener

2013
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,060
is saccharin, or sucralose,
or aspartame, or stevia.

2014
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:27,660
That's the gut microbiome.

2015
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,910
But what we are talking about here

2016
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,320
is independent of the form of artificial

2017
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,330
or non-caloric sweetener,

2018
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:34,560
because it has everything to do with

2019
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,830
whether or not there is a match

2020
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:39,330
or a mismatch between the perceived taste,

2021
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:42,710
and the effect of the thing
that you are consuming

2022
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:45,290
on blood sugar and metabolism.

2023
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,960
So the first takeaway from this is,

2024
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,800
if you're going to consume
artificial sweeteners,

2025
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,530
it's really important that you do that

2026
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:57,700
not in conjunction with foods
that increase blood glucose.

2027
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,180
Second of all, it points to the fact,

2028
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,963
that the foods that we prefer,

2029
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,853
and the activation of the dopamine system,

2030
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,700
both through the gut,

2031
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,350
and at the level of conscious taste,

2032
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:15,030
in other words, what we
like, is very plastic.

2033
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,490
It's mutable, and we can change it.

2034
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,660
How can we change it?

2035
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:22,340
Well, earlier, I mentioned
a structure in the brain

2036
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:23,490
called the insula,

2037
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:26,290
this incredible structure that's
involved in interoception,

2038
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:28,150
and interoception of all kinds.

2039
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:30,330
In fact, just as an aside,

2040
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:31,950
a year or so ago,

2041
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:34,350
my lab published a paper showing that

2042
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:38,690
activity within certain
compartments of the insula

2043
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,420
of humans is responding to

2044
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,200
a heightened state of anxiety in the body.

2045
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,640
It can respond to changes
in our respiration,

2046
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:47,750
changes in our heart rate.

2047
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,583
So this is...

2048
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:51,200
Again, it's a readout
of our internal state,

2049
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,100
not just of taste,

2050
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,600
but of many, many different
aspects of the mechanics

2051
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,330
and chemistry of our internal
milieu within our body.

2052
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:02,730
All of the work that I
was describing previously

2053
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,350
has also been addressed
at the neural level.

2054
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:09,700
And using a broad brush
to explain these results,

2055
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,873
what we can say is,

2056
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:14,423
when there is dopamine increase,

2057
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:19,060
one sees activation of the
so-called nucleus accumbens,

2058
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:22,410
which is part of the so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway.

2059
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:23,243
If you'd like to learn more about

2060
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:27,440
the mesolimbic reward pathway,
and dopamine in general

2061
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,970
in humans and in animal studies,

2062
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,690
and all the various incredible

2063
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,980
and challenging things that
dopamine can do for us,

2064
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,990
there's a episode all about
dopamine that you can look up.

2065
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:40,893
It's easy to find at Hubermanlab.com.

2066
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:45,740
The increases in dopamine
associated with sweet taste

2067
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:49,683
and/or blood glucose
elevating foods and drinks,

2068
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,760
cause activation of the nucleus accumbens.

2069
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,570
That's not surprising.

2070
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:55,920
Also in the circuit

2071
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,930
is activation of the
so-called arcuate nuclei

2072
01:23:58,930 --> 01:23:59,900
within the hypothalamus.

2073
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,560
These are areas of the hypothalamus

2074
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,470
that respond to hormones from the body,

2075
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:06,960
and respond to hormones and
neuropeptides in the brain,

2076
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,220
as well as neural signals in the brain,

2077
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:12,390
to drive us to eat
more, or to stop eating.

2078
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,870
So it's hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens.

2079
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:16,080
These are sort of the...

2080
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,480
Hypothalamus and the arcuate
being the motivating to eat,

2081
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,780
or motivating to stop eating.

2082
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:25,380
Both sets of neurons are contained there.

2083
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,510
There are other areas like the
lateral hypothalamus as well.

2084
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,210
But hypothalamus is
sort of the accelerator

2085
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:30,330
and the break on eating.

2086
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:32,320
And then the nucleus accumbens

2087
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,280
and dopamine release can be thought of

2088
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:38,590
as kind of a nitro boost, if
you will, like the kids say.

2089
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:39,470
Do the kids say that anymore?

2090
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:43,930
Anyway, a nitro boost to
increase what we call the gain

2091
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:47,840
or the volume of how much you
want more of something, okay?

2092
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,010
When dopamine is present,

2093
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,880
it's this kind of generic signal

2094
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,430
to go seek out more of
whatever caused that release.

2095
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,940
And then there's the insula.

2096
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,220
This very thoughtful, rational...

2097
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,053
Not really.

2098
01:24:59,053 --> 01:24:59,886
It's not thinking.

2099
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:00,719
It's a brain area.

2100
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,303
You're thinking, but it's part
of the areas of your brain

2101
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:05,400
that are interpreting what's
going on in your body.

2102
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,930
Whether or not you feel good or not good.

2103
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:11,720
Whether or not you feel
anxious, excited, or fearful.

2104
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,330
It's integrating all that information.

2105
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:18,370
And fed into this entire circuit as well

2106
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:20,560
are the inputs from
your prefrontal cortex,

2107
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,080
which is your thinking, rational,

2108
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,810
neuronal structure, if you will,

2109
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,720
informing you, for instance,

2110
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,610
ah, well, I don't really
like salmon very much,

2111
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:34,120
or I'm not so crazy about kale,

2112
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,980
but it has omega-3s,

2113
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:41,550
or it's rich in these
polyphenols that are good for me.

2114
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:46,220
And if one decides that they
are going to eat these things,

2115
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,350
not just because they are good for them,

2116
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,110
but believe it or not,

2117
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,880
if one takes the perception

2118
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,100
or adopts the perception that
they are both good for you,

2119
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:59,590
and that in being good for you,

2120
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:01,450
they are good for your brain metabolism,

2121
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:05,200
and that you desire to be healthy,

2122
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,930
as crazy as it sounds,

2123
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,920
those subjective signals
of what you tell yourself

2124
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,720
about the foods that you're eating

2125
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:16,150
can actually impact how
those foods will taste,

2126
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,294
maybe not immediately, but eventually,

2127
01:26:17,294 --> 01:26:20,500
and can impact the way in which your body

2128
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,350
utilizes those foods.

2129
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:25,560
Now, that might seem like
a absolute pipe dream.

2130
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,670
If I just imagine that I like mackerel,

2131
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:29,130
mackerel will start to taste good.

2132
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:30,030
I'm not saying that.

2133
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:34,200
I didn't say that you
could override yuck signals

2134
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,320
with this mechanism.

2135
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,610
I didn't say that you could take a food

2136
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:41,460
that would be absolutely noxious to you,

2137
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,360
or make you want to
vomit, and override that.

2138
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,340
However, foods that are
somewhat neutral to you

2139
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:51,450
can take on a different value

2140
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:54,400
based on the activation
of the dopamine system.

2141
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,410
And now, knowing what you know,

2142
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,930
there are a couple ways that
you could imagine doing that.

2143
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:02,940
First of all, you could,
in this so-called gedanken,

2144
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:03,960
or thought experiment,

2145
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,550
you could, for instance,
swap out sucralose,

2146
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:09,620
because sucralose is just a taste, right?

2147
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,500
It's an artificial sweet taste.

2148
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,170
You could swap that out,

2149
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,410
and insert kale,

2150
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:19,810
but eat the kale with something
that raises blood glucose

2151
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,010
to some degree or another.

2152
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,170
Now, I'm not encouraging
anyone to run out there

2153
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:25,710
and spike their blood
glucose glucose like crazy.

2154
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:29,100
And in fact, blood glucose
isn't really the goal.

2155
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,960
If you recall, the goal is to get neurons

2156
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,220
to be metabolically active
with that blood glucose, okay?

2157
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,620
That's what's actually rewarded

2158
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:38,350
at a sub-sub-conscious level,

2159
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:41,020
meaning at a deep subconscious level.

2160
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,180
But consuming these foods with other foods

2161
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:45,280
that increase blood glucose,

2162
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,420
and thereby, brain metabolism,

2163
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,750
or I suppose, if you're ketogenic,

2164
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,833
here in the ketosis,

2165
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:53,930
I don't know what the range of foods

2166
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,220
that are allowed on ketosis are,

2167
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,420
so I don't want to misspeak here,

2168
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:59,600
and say, cracker, which
would probably be a sin

2169
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,940
in the context of ketosis,

2170
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,470
and no knock against ketosis.

2171
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:04,470
I'm offering this, in part,

2172
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:07,050
because I think that there are
a number of people that have

2173
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:10,310
and can positively benefit
from a ketogenic diet.

2174
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:11,143
But for instance,

2175
01:28:11,143 --> 01:28:14,250
if there's a food that you
want to consume more of,

2176
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:18,310
but that you find somewhat
meh, or mildly yuh, yuck,

2177
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:21,950
even pairing it with ketones,

2178
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:25,900
if indeed, you are using ketones
for your brain metabolism,

2179
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,020
'cause that's what happens
on the ketogenic diet,

2180
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:31,320
over time, that food will be reinforced

2181
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,300
by the dopamine pathway.

2182
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,830
We know this from these studies

2183
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,800
where sucralose was the
substance paired with

2184
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,980
the glucose elevating.

2185
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,010
In other words, metabolically
elevating the food substance,

2186
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:44,840
or liquid substance.

2187
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,010
So how does one go about doing this?

2188
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:50,250
Well, first of all, I want to emphasize,

2189
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,870
that this experiment
actually has been done

2190
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,603
in a slightly different context.

2191
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:58,820
Studies by my colleague, Alia Crum,

2192
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,270
in the Psychology Department at Stanford

2193
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:04,660
have explored the bodily response,

2194
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,200
in terms of insulin release,

2195
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,913
and the release of other food
and eating-related hormones,

2196
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:15,020
as well as overall feelings
of satisfaction, et cetera,

2197
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:19,680
in groups of people
that drink a milkshake,

2198
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,330
and are either told that
it's a low calorie shake

2199
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:25,570
that contains various nutrients
that are good for them,

2200
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,550
or a higher calorie shake

2201
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:30,143
that has a lot of nutrients, et cetera.

2202
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:32,660
And what they found,

2203
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:33,840
was that the different groups,

2204
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,650
and here, again, I'm being very general

2205
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:37,390
with my description of these studies,

2206
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:41,020
but what they found, is that
the physiological response,

2207
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,400
the insulin response, the
blood glucose response,

2208
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,610
and the subjective measures

2209
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:48,140
of whether or not people
enjoyed something or not,

2210
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,610
were heavily influenced
by what they were told

2211
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,060
were in these milkshakes.

2212
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,460
So blood glucose would go up.

2213
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:54,293
Insulin would go up

2214
01:29:54,293 --> 01:29:56,240
when people were told it
was a high calorie shake

2215
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,270
with lots of nutrients.

2216
01:29:57,270 --> 01:30:00,750
Less so when people
ingested a shake that was,

2217
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:04,090
you know, that they were
told had less nutrients,

2218
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,350
and so forth.

2219
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:09,690
When in reality, it was
the identical shake.

2220
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:10,523
This is incredible.

2221
01:30:10,523 --> 01:30:11,850
This is a belief effect.

2222
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,560
This is not placebo, right?

2223
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,140
A placebo effect is different.

2224
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,900
Placebo effect is in comparison.

2225
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,460
It's where the control condition actually

2226
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:22,430
influences outcomes to a same,

2227
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:26,540
or to some degree, just like
the experimental condition.

2228
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,730
This is not a placebo effect.

2229
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,480
This is a belief effect,

2230
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:33,210
where the belief and the
subjective thoughts about

2231
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:35,270
what a given food will do

2232
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:38,350
has a direct impact on
a physiological measure,

2233
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,200
like blood sugar and blood glucose.

2234
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,210
Okay, so let's zoom out
from this for a second,

2235
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:45,780
and think about how we
can incorporate this

2236
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:50,130
into adopting consumption of healthy foods

2237
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:53,680
that serve our brain health in
the immediate and long-term.

2238
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,910
And if you're wondering what those are,

2239
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:56,820
I listed them out at the
beginning of the episode,

2240
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,170
and their justification
for being on that list.

2241
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,910
What this means is,

2242
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:04,810
obviously, you want to
consume foods that you like,

2243
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:07,720
but because brain health
is very important,

2244
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,683
and many of the foods
that promote brain health,

2245
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,000
perhaps, are not the most palatable to you

2246
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,100
or desirable to you,

2247
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,380
the key would be to ingest the foods

2248
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,430
that you want to ingest more of

2249
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:23,370
simply because they're good for you,

2250
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:25,313
and not because they taste good to you,

2251
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,940
alongside foods that increase

2252
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:31,430
whatever fuel system you
happen to be relying on.

2253
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,500
I think that's the most nutritionally

2254
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,910
politically correct way to say it.

2255
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:35,743
So if you're keto,

2256
01:31:35,743 --> 01:31:37,690
that would mean ketones, okay?

2257
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:39,240
If you're not ketogenic,

2258
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,600
and I think most people
probably are not in ketosis,

2259
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,370
or trying to maintain ketosis,

2260
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,203
but for instance,

2261
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:46,060
people that are on a
purely plant-based diet,

2262
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,160
that would be one set of foods.

2263
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,720
For people that are omnivores,

2264
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,553
a different set of foods.

2265
01:31:49,553 --> 01:31:50,840
And for people that are carnivores,

2266
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,123
yet another set of foods.

2267
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,090
If you want to eat more
of a particular food

2268
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,020
because it's good for you,

2269
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:58,550
pair it with something in the same meal.

2270
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:00,470
You don't have to hide it physically,

2271
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:02,400
or in the flavor sense.

2272
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,250
You don't have to hide it
within that other food,

2273
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,340
but pair it with that other food

2274
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,900
that provides you a shift
in brain metabolism,

2275
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,070
because that's really what
your brain and you are seeking,

2276
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,840
even though you don't realize it.

2277
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,210
How long will this take?

2278
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,990
Well, according to the
data in humans on sucralose

2279
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:23,950
and the conditioning for
sucralose to have these effects,

2280
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:26,800
which, in many cases,
were detrimental, right?

2281
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,410
Because they were increasing insulin.

2282
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,740
But in this case, you're trying to

2283
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:33,660
hijack this conditioning
of food preference

2284
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,940
for healthy purposes,

2285
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:36,860
not with sucralose,

2286
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,200
but by ingesting things
that are good for you,

2287
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,980
then the data really point to the fact

2288
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,950
that even within a short period
of time of about seven days,

2289
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:47,120
but certainly within 14 days,

2290
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,650
that food will take on
a subjective experience

2291
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:54,920
of tasting at least better
to you, if not good to you.

2292
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,490
Now, I believe this has
important implications

2293
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:59,460
for much of the controversy

2294
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,090
and food wars that we see out there.

2295
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:04,230
Food wars being, of course,

2296
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:09,000
these groups that ardently
subscribe to the idea

2297
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,330
that their diet and the
things that they are eating

2298
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:13,727
are the foods that are good for us,

2299
01:33:13,727 --> 01:33:15,670
and that are the most pleasureful,

2300
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:18,550
and the things that
everyone should be eating.

2301
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:23,150
We see this with every community
within the nutrition realm.

2302
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:26,000
Now, of course, there are
studies that point to the fact

2303
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,970
that certain foods and food
components are healthier,

2304
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,120
probably for us and for the planet,

2305
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,980
but you really see it on
both ends of the spectrum.

2306
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,930
You've got people who are
on a pure carnivore diet

2307
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:37,730
who are arguing with a
lot of biomedical evidence

2308
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:40,430
that that's what's best
for us and beneficial.

2309
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:42,130
And then you've got
people that are arguing

2310
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,100
the same general sets of arguments,

2311
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:45,640
but for a purely plant-based diet.

2312
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:46,610
And then I think most people

2313
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:48,383
fall into the omnivore category.

2314
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:51,920
What's very clear, however,

2315
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,500
is that what we consume on a regular basis

2316
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,620
and what leads to increases
in brain metabolism

2317
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:01,530
leads to increases in dopamine,

2318
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:04,440
and thereby our motivation to eat them.

2319
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,730
So what this really says,

2320
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:08,600
is that what we tend to do regularly

2321
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:11,260
becomes reinforcing in and of itself.

2322
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:12,700
And I think, in large part,

2323
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,170
can explain the fact that,

2324
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,010
yes, indeed, for certain people,

2325
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:18,700
a given diet not only feels good,

2326
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,420
but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient

2327
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:24,740
and kind of health beneficial
effects of that diet.

2328
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,270
And they often will
provide evidence for that,

2329
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:29,700
whether or not you ask them for it or not.

2330
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,050
But that's true of every subcategory

2331
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:34,453
within the nutrition realm.

2332
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,770
Again, this is not to take away

2333
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,480
from some of the beautiful data

2334
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,410
emphasizing that certain foods,

2335
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:42,510
and micronutrients, et cetera,

2336
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,580
are better for us, or worse
for us, and for the planet.

2337
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,683
That's not a debate I want
to get into right now.

2338
01:34:47,683 --> 01:34:49,220
What this emphasizes,

2339
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:53,530
is that foods impact our
brain and its health,

2340
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:57,900
but they also impact
how our brain functions

2341
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,750
and responds to food,

2342
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,630
and that is largely a learned response.

2343
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,500
We can't completely
override, for instance,

2344
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:09,500
that certain foods evoke a
strong, [grunts] yuck component.

2345
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,680
Certain foods are truly putrid to us.

2346
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,570
I should just say, certain
things are putrid to us,

2347
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,483
and we should not consume them, right?

2348
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,890
At the far end of the spectrum,

2349
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:19,900
it's hard-wired for us to avoid those,

2350
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,970
because they can be dangerous for us.

2351
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:24,150
They can make us very, very sick.

2352
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:25,640
But it's also true,

2353
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,790
that if we continue to eat foods

2354
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,550
that are progressively sweeter and sweeter

2355
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:31,000
and highly palatable,

2356
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,780
it shifts our dopamine system,

2357
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:34,970
because it activates our dopamine system

2358
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:36,850
to make us believe that those foods

2359
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,960
are the only foods that can
trigger this reward system,

2360
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,190
and make us feel good,
and that they taste good.

2361
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:46,070
But after consuming foods
that perhaps are less sweet

2362
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:47,950
or even less savory,

2363
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,910
that are not what we would call highly,

2364
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:52,320
or I would say, nowadays,
it's super palatable foods,

2365
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,220
we can adjust our sense literally

2366
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:59,820
of what we perceive as an
attractive and rewarding food,

2367
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,620
and indeed, the dopamine system

2368
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:04,320
will reward those foods accordingly.

2369
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,550
I can't emphasize enough

2370
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:10,040
how much this learning
of associated food reward

2371
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:12,790
is important for not just understanding

2372
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:14,570
why we like the foods that we eat,

2373
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:17,440
and how to eat more of foods
that are healthy for us,

2374
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,070
and enjoy them,

2375
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:24,070
but it also speaks to the fact
that our brain, as a whole,

2376
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:26,820
is a perceptual device
trying to make guesses

2377
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,130
or estimations about

2378
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,450
what certain foods are going to do for us.

2379
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:31,990
So put simply,

2380
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:34,040
we don't just like sweet
foods because they taste good,

2381
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,330
we like them because they predict

2382
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,223
a certain kind of metabolic response.

2383
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:39,530
This is important also,

2384
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:44,140
because Dana Small, and Ivan de Araujo,

2385
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:45,560
and others have been exploring

2386
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,480
whether or not people, for instance,

2387
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,830
that have type 2 diabetes,

2388
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,090
or that suffer from any number

2389
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:52,360
of different metabolic disorders,

2390
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,250
whether or not somehow

2391
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,630
these food reward systems
are permanently disrupted,

2392
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,520
and through a beautiful set of experiments

2393
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,610
that have been done by mainly
by Dana Small's group at Yale,

2394
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:05,810
but also by the de
Araujo group and others,

2395
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:10,300
exploring how the reward
pathways are altered

2396
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,790
in various metabolic disorders, et cetera,

2397
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:14,913
people suffering from type 2 diabetes.

2398
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:18,070
We don't have time to go
into all those data now,

2399
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:19,400
but the takeaway is,

2400
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,300
that food preference,

2401
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,770
and the ability to reshape these circuits

2402
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:26,150
is not disrupted in these people

2403
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,240
to the point where it can't be rewired,

2404
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,370
and that's very encouraging,

2405
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:30,710
because what it means is that,

2406
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:33,350
for people that are suffering
from these syndromes,

2407
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:36,803
through some simple
alterations in dietary choice,

2408
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,890
provided those are carried out over time

2409
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,580
and in the correct way,

2410
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:44,780
by pairing with the foods
that will appropriately

2411
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:46,490
shift metabolism of the brain,

2412
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:48,780
one can actually rewire what they consider

2413
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:49,820
not just palatable,

2414
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,500
but attractive as foods.

2415
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:55,600
If you want to learn
more about food reward

2416
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,830
and food reinforcement,

2417
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:59,150
'cause it turns out, those
are slightly different things,

2418
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:02,960
there's a wonderful review
written by Ivan de Araujo.

2419
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,070
They have a middle author,
Mark Schachter, and Dana Small.

2420
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:07,870
It's called "Rethinking Food Reward",

2421
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:10,830
and it was published in the
"Annual Reviews of Psychology".

2422
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:12,250
You can find it very easily online.

2423
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:14,070
It was published in 2019.

2424
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:16,280
And it's a beautiful, deep dive,

2425
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,490
although, quite accessible to most people,

2426
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:20,720
about how different foods,

2427
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,570
and the way that we perceive them

2428
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,030
impacts our brain and body,

2429
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:25,790
and why we like the things we like,

2430
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:28,070
and how to reshape what we like.

2431
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:31,140
So once again, we've done a
fairly extensive deep dive

2432
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,690
into food and your brain,

2433
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,830
focusing first on how particular foods

2434
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:38,800
and compounds within foods

2435
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:41,280
that are available also
through supplementation

2436
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,272
can impact immediate and
long-term brain health.

2437
01:38:43,272 --> 01:38:46,800
Came up with a relatively short list

2438
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,820
of what I would call super foods,

2439
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:52,370
only because there are
ample data to support

2440
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:55,290
their role in enhancing short
and long-term cognition,

2441
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,330
and neuronal health, and so on.

2442
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:00,330
And we also talked about food preference,

2443
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:02,320
and why particular tastes,

2444
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,300
and particular events within the gut,

2445
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:07,700
and particular events
within the brain combine

2446
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,950
to lead us to pursue particular foods,

2447
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:12,710
and to avoid other foods,

2448
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:15,370
and how you can leverage those pathways

2449
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:17,180
in order to pursue more of the foods

2450
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:19,410
that are going to be
good for you, and good,

2451
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,420
not just for your brain,

2452
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,150
but for your overall body health,

2453
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:24,010
and to enjoy them along the way.

2454
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:26,730

we are Huberman Lab at Instagram,

2465
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:53,170
and there, I do neuroscience tutorials

2466
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,240
that sometimes have
overlapped with the podcast,

2467
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:58,090
but often, are original
content altogether.

2468
01:39:58,090 --> 01:40:00,970
We are also Huberman Lab on Twitter.

2469
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:02,520
Another terrific way to support us

2470
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,030
is by checking out our sponsors

2471
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:05,980
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the episode.

2472
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:07,230
we also have a Patreon.

2473
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,940
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2474
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:11,720
And there, you can support the podcast

2475
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,123
at any level that you like.

2476
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:16,980
During today's podcast, and on
many other previous episodes,

2477
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,840
we talked about various supplements.

2478
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,010
One of the major issues with supplements

2479
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:23,320
is that supplement
companies don't always have

2480
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,800
the highest quality standards,

2481
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,310
and/or the amounts of the supplements

2482
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:28,420
that they list on the bottle

2483
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:30,780
aren't what actually are
contained in the capsules,

2484
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,100
and pills, and powders
of those supplements.

2485
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,880
For that reason, we partner
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2486
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,920
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency

2487
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,050
with respect to the quality
of the supplements they use,

2488
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,400
and the quantity of the
supplements they use.

2489
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,200
They partnered with all
the major sports teams,

2490
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,240
and with the Mayo Clinic,

2491
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,670
and we have tremendous confidence

2492
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:49,990
in the quality of their supplements.

2493
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:52,170
If you'd like to see the
supplements that I take,

2494
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:57,170
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

2495
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:00,870
There, you can get 20% off
any of those supplements.

2496
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:03,340
And if you navigate into the main site

2497
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:06,460
through that portal of
thorne.com/u/huberman,

2498
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:08,100
you can also get 20% off any

2499
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,250
of the supplements that Thorne makes.

2500
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:12,450
And last, but not least,

2501
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:14,149
thank you for your interest in science.
