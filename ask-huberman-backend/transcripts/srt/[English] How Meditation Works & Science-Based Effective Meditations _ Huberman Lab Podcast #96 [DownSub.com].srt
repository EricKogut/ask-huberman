00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,280
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,123
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:09,090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,080
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,940
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,340
Today, we are discussing meditation.

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,740
We are going to discuss
the science of meditation,

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,840
that is, what happens
in the brain and body

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,520
while we are meditating,

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,560
and we will talk about
the science of meditation

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,080
as it relates to how the
brain and body change

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,850
as a consequence of meditation,

15
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,450
that is, what you export or
take from a meditation practice

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,720
that can impact everything
from your sleep to your mood.

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,490
For instance, meditation has been shown

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,980
to alleviate symptoms of depression.

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,900
And we will also talk about how meditation

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,020
can be used to enhance focus
and other states of mind

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,020
that are useful for work
and other aspects of life.

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,860
Now, of course, most of you

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,150
have probably heard of meditation,

24
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,740
and when we think of meditation,

25
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,360
most often, we think of somebody

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,980
either sitting or lying down.

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,630
If they're sitting, we might imagine them

28
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,920
in the so-called lotus position,

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,810
you know, sitting with
legs crossed, very upright,

30
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,570
with hands on the knees or,
you know, crossed in our lap

31
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,950
or something of that sort.

32
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,620
Typically, we think of somebody
who is in a very calm state,

33
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,130
eyes closed, focused on their
so-called third eye center.

34
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,190
The third eye center is the
area just behind one's forehead.

35
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,000
There's no third eye there,
at least there shouldn't be,

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,820
but I'll tell you why it's
called the third eye center

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,140
and what the origins of that are

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,200
and why it's relevant, actually,
for a meditative practice.

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,240
With all that said, it
turns out that meditation

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,390
encompasses a huge variety
of different practices.

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,490
Some of those practices
indeed are done sitting

42
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,290
or lying down with one's eyes closed,

43
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,940
focusing on the third eye center.

44
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,150
Other of those practices
are focused on a body scan,

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,400
you know, really focusing
on one area of the body

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,200
and its contact with whatever surface

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,030
you happen to be sitting or lying on

48
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,040
or can be done walking.

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,250
In fact, there are walking
meditations done with eyes open.

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,110
So there are many different
forms of meditation,

51
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,280
but today, we are going to focus

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,740
mainly on how specific types of meditation

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,840
and specific areas of the brain

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,120
that are activated
during those meditations

55
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,910
change our way of being
in fundamental ways,

56
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,890
not just during the meditation practice,

57
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,930
but afterwards as well.

58
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,490
So if you're somebody who's interested

59
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,000
in changing your default
state of mood or of thinking

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,740
or enhancing your ability to focus

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,590
or improving your sleep
or improving performance

62
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,780
in some cognitive or physical endeavor,

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,190
meditation is powerful,

64
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,120
but you want to make sure

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,550
that you pick the right
meditation practice.

66
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,460
So we will talk about
picking a meditation practice

67
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,650
that isn't just feasible
because you'll do it

68
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,430
but is actually directed at
the goals specific to you

69
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,810
and what you need most.

70
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,510
So to give you some sense of
the contour of today's episode,

71
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,343
first, I'm going to talk about

72
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:39,060
some of the underlying biology,

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,640
the mechanisms and the brain areas

74
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,300
and also the areas of the
body that are activated

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,920
during certain forms of meditation,

76
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,760
and, equally important,

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,930
which areas of the brain and body

78
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,090
are shut down or reduced in their activity

79
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,340
during specific types of meditation.

80
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,450
Then I'll transition

81
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,120
into how to best do a meditation practice,

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,790
how to get the most out of
that meditation practice,

83
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,830
and then I will talk about how to change

84
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,840
or alter your meditation practices

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,430
according to your specific goals

86
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,530
and as you get better at meditation.

87
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,210
And this can get a little
bit counterintuitive,

88
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,560
but in a positive way.

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,990
What I mean by that is, for
instance, a lot of people think

90
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,300
that as you meditate and
get better at meditating,

91
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,610
you need to meditate
more and more and more,

92
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,070
sort of like if you get better
at running endurance races

93
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,780
that you need to keep
running longer and longer,

94
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,760
you know, first a 5K, then a 10K,

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,530
then a marathon, then ultras.

96
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,690
With meditation, it's
actually quite the opposite.

97
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,220
The better that you get

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,220
at dropping into a particular brain state

99
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,700
and the more your so-called
traits of brain state shift,

100
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,860
not just states as they're
sometimes referred to,

101
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,750
but traits, this is a
theme that I've picked up

102
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,900
from a terrific book
that I'll refer to later,

103
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,160
but the more that you can get

104
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,430
into specific neural circuits quickly,

105
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,280
actually, the less you need to meditate

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,100
in order to derive the
benefits of meditation.

107
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,500
So that's a wonderful aspect
of meditative practices

108
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,280
that's unlike a lot of other
forms of mental exercise

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,320
and cognitive enhancing exercises.

110
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
So we'll talk about all of that today,

111
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,190
and I promise that by the
end of today's episode,

112
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,560
you will have a rich array
of meditative practices

113
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,393
to select from,

114
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:09,930
you'll know why each of them work

115
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,330
and why they can be directed
toward particular goals

116
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,590
and how to do that,

117
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,423
and you'll also know

118
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,980
how to modify those meditation practices

119
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,839
under conditions where
you might get busier

120
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,606
or where you're suffering
from lack of sleep,

121
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,470
and I think a lot of people
will be excited to know

122
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,910
that today we're going to discuss

123
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,410
a specific form of meditation

124
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,290
that can indeed reduce your need for sleep

125
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,990
and still allow you to
enhance your cognitive

126
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,370
and physical abilities.

127
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,980
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

128
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,770
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

129
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,960
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

130
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,880
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

131
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,920
about science and science-related tools

132
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,150
to the general public.

133
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,290
In keeping with that theme,

134
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,020
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

135
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,359
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

136
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,700
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

137
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,310
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

138
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,990
to help you better understand your body

139
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,520
and help you meet your health goals.

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,540
Now, I've long been a believer

141
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,220
in getting regular blood work done

142
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,470
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

143
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,570
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

144
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,030
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

145
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,530
One issue with a lot of blood tests

146
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,940
and DNA tests out there, however,

147
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,290
is that you get information back

148
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,540
about hormones, blood lipids, et cetera,

149
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,280
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,860
InsideTracker makes understanding
all of that very easy

151
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,680
and, even better, points
to specific directives,

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,870
that is, things you can do
in terms of your lifestyle,

153
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,030
your nutrition,
supplementation, et cetera,

154
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,500
in order to bring those numbers

155
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,350
related to metabolic factors,
lipids, hormones, et cetera,

156
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,600
into the ranges that are optimal for you,

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,640
your immediate and long-term health.

158
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,350

162
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,020
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.

163
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,850
Thesis makes custom nootropics,

164
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,670
and to be honest, I am not a
fan of the word nootropics.

165
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,810
I've said this many times before

166
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,610
on this podcast and other podcasts,

167
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,500
and the reason I don't
like the word nootropics

168
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,750
is that it means smart drugs.

169
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,490
And as a neuroscientist,

170
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm aware that there are neural circuits,

171
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,270
that is, connections in the brain and body

172
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,950
that underlie things like focus

173
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,000
or our ability to switch tasks
or creativity, et cetera.

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,640
There is no neural
circuit for being smart.

175
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,590
And so Thesis understands this,

176
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,020
and as a consequence, they've
developed custom nootropics

177
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,970
that are designed to
bring your brain and body

178
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,450
into specific states to become,
for instance, more focused

179
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,250
or to engage in creative work

180
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,520
or to have more energy for
workouts and things of that sort.

181
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,040
At Thesis, you can go there,
you take a brief quiz,

182
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,600
and they will design a kit

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,880
of four different custom
nootropics that you can try

184
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,830
and then modify along with their help

185
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,170
so that you can develop a
kit of custom nootropics

186
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,240
that are perfect for your needs.

187
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,670
Perhaps one for creativity,
another one for motivation,

188
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,980
another one for focus, and
another one for energy.

189
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,420
They'll build those for you.

190
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,370
To get your own personalized
nootropics starter kit,

191
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,100
you can go online to

192
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,770

195
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,890
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

196
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,810
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

197
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,970
that are of the absolute highest quality.

198
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,803
The company was founded

199
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,760
by two all-American
swimmers from Stanford,

200
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,100
and everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses

201
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,350
were designed with performance in mind.

202
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,210
Now, I spent a lifetime
working on the visual system,

203
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,470
and I can tell you that your visual system

204
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,020
has to contend with an
enormous number of challenges

205
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,820
in order for you to be
able to see clearly.

206
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,810
ROKA understands this

207
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,940
and has designed their
sunglasses and eyeglasses

208
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,130
to be worn in any number
of different conditions

209
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,950
and for you to still be able
to see with crystal clarity

210
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,290
They were designed for things
like cycling and running

211
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,150
so they won't slip off your
face if they get sweaty,

212
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,200
they're extremely lightweight.

213
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,070
In fact, most of the time,

214
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,480
I can't even remember
that they're on my face,

215
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,313
they're so lightweight.

216
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:39,330
However, they also can be worn anywhere,

217
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,800
to work, to dinner, et cetera.

218
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,910
They have a terrific aesthetic,

219
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,743
unlike a lot of other
performance eyeglasses out there

220
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,570
that you can only find in designs

221
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,250
that really make people
look like a cyborg.

222
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,470
ROKA makes the cyborg versions,
some people like those,

223
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,210
but they also make versions

224
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,370
of their eyeglasses and
sunglasses with frames

225
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,040
that you can wear out to
dinner, to work, et cetera.

226
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,200
If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses,

232
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,690
The Huberman Lab podcast

233
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,520
is now partnered with
Momentous supplements.

234
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,870
To find the supplements we discuss

235
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,070
on the Huberman Lab podcast,

236
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,010
you can go to livemomentous,
spelled O-U-S,

237
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,957
livemomentous.com/huberman.

238
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,670
And I should just mention that the library

239
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,860
of those supplements is
constantly expanding.

240
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,950
Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.

241
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,330
Let's talk about meditation.

242
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,590
As I mentioned earlier,

243
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,260
we are going to talk about what
areas of the brain and body

244
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,169
are active during meditation
and after meditation

245
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,239
and why that can be so beneficial.

246
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,153
We will also talk about when
and how best to meditate.

247
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,940
Now, this is a topic I've
long been interested in.

248
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,710
I was first given a book on meditation

249
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,180
when I was in high school

250
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,160
because, to make a long story short,

251
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,130
I was a bit of a wild one
early in my high school years,

252
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,850
and as a consequence of
a program that I was in,

253
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,370
somebody handed me a book on meditation.

254
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,320
That book is still available now.

255
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,780
That book is called "Wherever
You Go, There you Are"

256
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,430
by Jon Kabat-Zinn.

257
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,320
He was one of the first, not the only,

258
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,700
but one of the first people

259
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,407
to really start popularizing meditation

260
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:10,680
and mindfulness practices
in the United States.

261
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,350
So this was in the late 1980s,

262
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,020
and it was really only until recently

263
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,600
that there were very few
studies of meditation,

264
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,940
although those really
picked up in the '90s.

265
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,540
Now you can find many,
many thousands of studies

266
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,460
on meditation and their mechanistic basis,

267
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,400
so brain imaging studies,
changes in hormones in the body.

268
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,760
But in the late 1980s
and in the early 1990s,

269
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,740
because functional imaging of the brain,

270
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,820
so-called MRI or fMRI, was
really just starting to emerge

271
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,670
as a popular tool in
laboratories and hospitals,

272
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,770
there really wasn't that much
mechanistic understanding

273
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,240
about how meditation worked,

274
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,580
but, of course, there
was a deep understanding

275
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,190
from cultures outside the United States

276
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,620
that meditation was extremely useful.

277
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,490
I should just mention,

278
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,010
as long as we're talking about
the history of meditation,

279
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,110
any discussion about meditation

280
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,780
is going to be a discussion
about states of mind,

281
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,790
and any discussion about states of mind

282
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,260
invokes the word consciousness,

283
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,920
a kind of a dangerous topic
to get into in any format

284
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,010
because a lot of people
talk about consciousness,

285
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,070
but people use consciousness, the word,

286
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,180
to mean different things.

287
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,700
It doesn't have one standard
operational definition

288
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,470
as scientists call it.

289
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,170
However, discussions about consciousness

290
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,080
are often part and
parcel with conversations

291
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,000
about things like psychedelics

292
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,890
and kind of alternative therapies.

293
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,010
And so in the 1960s and
especially in the 1970s,

294
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,910
meditation and psychedelics
were actually close cousins

295
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,210
in the conversation about
consciousness and states of mind.

296
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,940
That conversation started to split

297
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,530
into two different divisions,

298
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,600
and I'll explain why in a moment.

299
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,570
It gets to a little bit of
interesting academic sociology.

300
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,580
But what happened was
there were a couple of guys

301
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,210
at Harvard, including
Timothy Leary and others,

302
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,580
who got really interested in psychedelics,

303
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,180
in particular LSD,
lysergic acid diethylamide.

304
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,410
And at that time,

305
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,360
that was part of the whole
counterculture movement,

306
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,400
it was considered very anti-establishment,

307
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,580
and they were really
encouraging students at Harvard

308
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,620
to take LSD.

309
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,810
They were also very
interested in meditation.

310
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,890
But what ended up happening

311
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,920
is they essentially got kicked
out or fired from Harvard,

312
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,630
and there's a book that I'll refer you to

313
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,710
in the show note captions

314
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,330
if you're interested in
learning more about all this.

315
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,710
But they got kicked out and fired

316
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,780
for their emphasis on psychedelics.

317
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,720
Now, nowadays, there's a lot
of interest in psychedelics.

318
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,060
We've had episodes with
Dr. Matthew Johnson

319
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,670
from Johns Hopkins University
who's running clinical trials

320
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,650
on psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD

321
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,050
for the treatment of depression and PTSD.

322
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,720
We've also had Dr. Nolan
Williams on the podcast,

323
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,480
my colleague at Stanford
who's doing incredible studies

324
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,100
on some of those compounds as well.

325
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,020
So nowadays, the conversation
about psychedelics

326
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,070
is coming back,

327
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,660
and it's somewhat divorced

328
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,730
from the conversation about meditation,

329
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,490
but in the 1960s and 1970s,

330
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,890
the conversation about
psychedelics and meditation

331
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,543
was sort of one and the same.

332
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,790
That changed in the late
1980s and early 1990s

333
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,350
when people like Jon Kabat-Zinn

334
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,260
started writing books that
were purely about meditation

335
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,050
and suggesting that people
explore meditative practices

336
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,850
for the utility to bring calmness,

337
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,910
adjust stress, improve sleep, et cetera,

338
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,490
divorced from the conversation
about psychedelics.

339
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,650
Now, that's not to say that
the scientific community

340
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,320
immediately embraced the
conversation about meditation.

341
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
In fact, it took quite a long while

342
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,180
for schools like Harvard and Stanford

343
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,800
and other universities around the world

344
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,060
to start embracing and
funding studies of meditation,

345
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,100
asking what sorts of
brain areas are involved,

346
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,360
how it changes the body,

347
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,980
and, perhaps most importantly,

348
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,590
how a meditation practice
can shift the brain and body

349
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,630
when somebody is finished meditating

350
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,750
and is off in their life
doing their everyday things.

351
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,740
In the late 1980s and
especially within the 1990s,

352
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,480
the advent of brain imaging technology

353
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,240
like magnetic residence imaging, MRI,

354
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,100
or functional magnetic residence imaging

355
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,610
was a way to look at the
brain while it was active,

356
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,440
not just to get an image of its structure,

357
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,730
but also how it's functioning

358
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,530
in the areas that so-called light up.

359
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,620
When all of that technology
became accessible and popular,

360
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,780
well, that allowed a large
number of laboratories

361
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,540
to start asking how specific patterns

362
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,040
of thinking and breathing,

363
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,750
maybe people sitting
in the lotus position,

364
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,680
but more often than that,

365
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,080
it would be people inside of an MRI magnet

366
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,950
because it is a magnet,

367
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,180
they sort of put you into a little tube

368
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,540
and push you into the tube, not
against your will of course,

369
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,180
but put people into the
tube, have them meditate,

370
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,070
and then look at how the brain changed

371
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,600
and to do that over time.

372
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
When those studies were done,

373
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,700
what was discovered was really
quite miraculous, really.

374
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,680
And now we don't think
of it as surprising,

375
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,940
but what was discovered

376
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,790
was a huge laundry list of brain changes.

377
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,270
And then when people were
evaluated in their outside life,

378
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,130
so when they would fill out reports

379
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,810
of their subjective feelings of happiness

380
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,070
or they would report their sleep,

381
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,410
or even if objective measures were taken

382
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,760
like changes in hormones

383
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,280
or markers of inflammation, et cetera,

384
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,270
a large list of information
fell out of that

385
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,060
which revealed that indeed there are many,

386
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,760
a dozen or more clear benefits

387
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,650
of a regular meditation practice,

388
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,950
and some of those meditation
practices could be quite short.

389
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,800
So nowadays, we think of meditation

390
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,220
as pretty commonly accepted,

391
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,830
and in fact, that has a
lot to do with the fact

392
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,050
that many of the major tech companies

393
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,220
in the Bay Area during the
2000s such as Google and Apple

394
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,680
and any number of different
social media companies

395
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,170
and other companies and
business ventures, et cetera,

396
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,600
and investment firms all over the world

397
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,090
started hiring people to train meditation

398
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,580
or had online courses for meditation.

399
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,860
So nowadays, we think of
meditation as this thing

400
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,220
that almost everybody
understands can benefit us,

401
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,280
but we now sit at an interesting frontier

402
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,550
where most people think of
meditation as one thing,

403
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,810
sort of like the word exercise,

404
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,370
which, of course, could
mean weight training,

405
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,203
it could mean running,

406
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:53,430
it could mean high-intensity
interval training,

407
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,940
all of which, as you know,
will get you different results

408
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,070
depending on what you
do, how often you do it,

409
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,770
and the specifics of what you actually do.

410
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,550
So, too, meditation can give
you very specific results.

411
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,450
It can give you more focus,
it can give you better sleep,

412
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,140
it can give you a combination of results

413
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,050
just like exercise can
depending on the exercise.

414
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,610
So what we are going to talk about next

415
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,400
is the specific changes
that happen in the brain

416
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,680
with specific aspects of meditation.

417
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,200
That is, what happens
when you close your eyes,

418
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,930
what happens when you
focus your attention inward

419
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,580
versus focusing your attention outward

420
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,990
because, as I mentioned before,

421
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,850
there's third eye meditation
where you close your eyes

422
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,130
and focus on that spot
just behind your forehead

423
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,600
and you focus on your breathing.

424
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,130
There's also meditation practices

425
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,630
where you're focusing
on what you're eating

426
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,280
with a lot of so-called mindfulness,

427
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,170
being very present to
whatever's happening,

428
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,610
not letting your mind wander

429
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,830
or think about yesterday or tomorrow

430
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,880
or what's happening next,

431
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,250
but really focusing on the present.

432
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,440
There are also meditation
practices, of course,

433
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,770
where you are in a format of
interpersonal communication

434
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,840
where you're really
listening very intensely.

435
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,640
That, too, is a form of mindfulness.

436
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,320
So we're going to parse
each of these things,

437
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,460
and we are going to ask

438
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,900
what's happening in the brain and body

439
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,000
during each of these meditation practices

440
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,910
so that you can develop
specific meditation practices

441
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,300
that you can invoke in your
real life on a daily basis

442
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,140
or, thankfully, I would say,
for some who are pretty busy,

443
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,930
that you could even do once
a week or even once a month

444
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,380
that will still clearly
benefit you in specific ways.

445
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,510
I'd like to spend the
next 10 minutes or so

446
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,817
talking about the
neuroscience of meditation,

447
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,040
and I promise you I'm not
going to just list off

448
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,270
a bunch of different brain areas

449
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,710
that are active during meditation.

450
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,760
That wouldn't be useful to you.

451
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,110
In fact, I don't believe

452
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,910
in throwing out a lot of nomenclature

453
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,880
without also giving some
mechanistic explanation

454
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,857
as to what different brain areas do.

455
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:39,990
And you could say, "Well,
what good is it knowing

456
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,820
what different brain
areas do and their names

457
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,980
if I can't actually
manipulate those brain areas?"

458
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,813
But the good news

459
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,370
is you actually can
manipulate those brain areas.

460
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,240
As I'll tell you today,

461
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,330
you can turn up the activity
in certain brain areas

462
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,060
and turn down the activity
in specific brain areas

463
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,880
with specific elements
of a meditation practice,

464
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,310
so that's quite exciting
and quite different really

465
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,960
from other aspects of neuroscience

466
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,150
that we might discuss on this podcast.

467
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,130
So there are a few different brain areas

468
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,230
whose names I'd like to arm you with.

469
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,260
And again, the names
themselves aren't essential,

470
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,300
but if you can grasp even the top contour

471
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,260
of what I'm about to say,

472
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,579
you'll be in a much better position

473
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,879
to parse and use the
information that follows.

474
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,410
There's an area of your brain

475
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,300
that sits right behind your forehead

476
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,280
that's called the prefrontal cortex.

477
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,650
Basically, it's the
front bumper of your head

478
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,690
just behind the bone, okay?

479
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,010
That area just behind your forehead

480
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,720
that we call the prefrontal cortex

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,910
actually encompasses a
lot of different things.

482
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,800
And actually, you have two of them.

483
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,480
You have one on the
right side of your brain

484
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,280
and you have one on the
left side of your brain,

485
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,510
and they're connected to one another

486
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,430
but they actually do different things.

487
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,100
The area that I'd like to
focus on today for a bit

488
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,980
is the so-called left prefrontal cortex,

489
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,840
or if we were going to
get really specific,

490
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,690
we'd say the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.

491
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,450
Dorsal means up, lateral
means to the side,

492
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,520
so if you want to touch
the left side of your head

493
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,860
and move your hand just
toward the midline,

494
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,050
toward the sort of top of
your head a little bit,

495
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,060
so that's dorsal, and then lateral,

496
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,620
as long as your hand is still
on the side of your head,

497
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,650
you're in the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, okay?

498
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,660
So you've got your hand
probably right over

499
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,540
your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

500
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,300
That area of the brain, we
know from lesion studies

501
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,670
where it's been damaged
in animals or humans

502
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,920
and we know from stimulation studies

503
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,130
where it's been selectively
stimulated in animals,

504
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,820
or yes, indeed, also
it's been done in humans,

505
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,470
has an incredible ability to
control your bodily senses

506
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,340
and to make sense, that is,
to interpret what's going on

507
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,490
in terms of your emotions
and your bodily sensations.

508
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,830
So from now on, unless I say otherwise,

509
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,740
if I say prefrontal cortex,
I'm specifically referring

510
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,990
to the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex,

511
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,130
but I'm going to shorten that up

512
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,980
just for sake of simplicity
and ease of communication.

513
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,080
If I'm going to talk about
another area of prefrontal cortex,

514
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,190
I'll talk about another area,

515
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,990
but if I say prefrontal cortex today,

516
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,960
what I mean is left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

517
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,780
Stimulation of left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

518
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,520
or, I should say more appropriately,

519
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,363
when your left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex is active,

520
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,990
you are in a great position

521
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,260
to interpret what's going
on with you emotionally,

522
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,580
to interpret your bodily signals
of comfort or discomfort,

523
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,380
and then to make really good decisions

524
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,320
on the basis of that interpretation.

525
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,010
And that's because the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

526
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,960
is in direct communication with

527
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,650
and is directly connected
to another brain area

528
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,040
called the anterior
cingulate cortex, or ACC.

529
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,520
Now, I'm just going to refer
to it as the ACC, okay?

530
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,340
The ACC is an area of your brain

531
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,350
that is interpreting a
lot of different things

532
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,730
about bodily signals,

533
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,313
for instance, how fast you're breathing,

534
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,900
whether or not your heart is
beating quickly or slowly,

535
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,040
and, more importantly,

536
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,530
whether or not your heart
is beating quickly or slowly

537
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,660
for the circumstance that you are in.

538
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,520
So for instance, if
you're running up a hill

539
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,040
and you're even in great shape

540
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,080
and your heart is beating very fast,

541
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,870
it's unlikely that you
are going to be concerned

542
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,550
about your heart beating fast

543
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,800
because that is appropriate
for the circumstance.

544
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,690
However, if you're just walking along

545
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,520
and all of a sudden, your heart
starts beating very quickly

546
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,520
for no apparent reason,

547
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,500
well, then you are going to interpret that

548
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,100
as either pathologic or uncomfortable,

549
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,193
inappropriate for the context
that you happen to be in.

550
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,090
The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

551
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,080
is the area of the brain

552
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,480
that actually has some control over

553
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,490
and especially can interpret

554
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,700
what's going on in this ACC region.

555
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,190
Now, most of you probably
haven't heard of the ACC.

556
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,500
Most of you probably have
heard of a brain area

557
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,340
called the amygdala.

558
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,750
It's an almond-shaped structure

559
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,800
on the two sides of the brain,

560
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,140
people talk about it as
the fear center, et cetera.

561
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,230
But your ACC, the
anterior cingulate cortex,

562
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,240
gets input from areas like the amygdala,

563
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,380
your threat detection centers,

564
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,650
but it also gets input
from an enormous number

565
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,510
of other areas of your brain and body,

566
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,900
including your heart, your gut,

567
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,750
so it gets information about how full,

568
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,690
that is, distended, or
how empty your gut is.

569
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,970
It gets information about
how quickly you're breathing

570
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,470
from input from your lungs
and related structures.

571
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,990
It's an absolutely critical station

572
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,240
for making sense of what's
going on in your body,

573
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,087
and it works very closely
along with one other structure.

574
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:26,520
And I promise this is going
to be the third structure

575
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,980
in this triad, and then
I'll stop listing off names.

576
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,510
So we have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

577
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,980
Think of that as sort of the interpreter

578
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,900
of what's going on inside of you.

579
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,900
You have the ACC, or
anterior cingulate cortex,

580
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,100
which is the area of your brain

581
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,110
that's bringing in all this information

582
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,270
about what's going on inside your body

583
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,980
and even on the surface of your body.

584
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,690
You know, if you have any pain or an itch

585
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,310
or a mosquito bite on
the surface of your body,

586
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,912
your ACC would definitely register that.

587
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:50,790
And then there's this other

588
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,440
absolutely incredible brain structure

589
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,800
which is called the insula,
I-N-S-U-L-A, insula,

590
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,140
and the insula has a bunch
of different parts to it.

591
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,400
But the insula is another area
that is interpreting signals

592
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,220
of what's going on in your brain and body,

593
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,350
so the ACC and the insula
are working together

594
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,290
to try and figure out, you
know, what's going on inside me?

595
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,700
And in addition to that,

596
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,770
the insula is interpreting information

597
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,290
about what's going on outside of you.

598
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,603
So your insula is saying, for instance,

599
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,940
hey, this is a steep
hill that I'm running up,

600
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,290
and as a consequence,

601
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,810
whatever heart rate increase
that I'm experiencing

602
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,730
or heavy breathing or burning in my lungs,

603
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,900
this all makes sense.

604
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,640
I don't have to be worried,
I don't have to be scared.

605
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,130
I might want to slow down,
but this makes sense.

606
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,860
Whereas, for instance, in the
example I previously gave,

607
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,480
where if you're sitting in a room

608
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,130
and everything is pretty calm,

609
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,650
and all of a sudden, you start
feeling really uncomfortable,

610
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,000
like your stomach doesn't feel right

611
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,130
or you start breathing quickly

612
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,380
or you start having a so-called
anxiety or panic attack,

613
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,840
in large part, that's because the shift

614
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,390
in your bodily sensations doesn't match

615
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,270
or doesn't correspond to
something in the outside world.

616
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,950
So there's this incredible triad

617
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,800
which includes the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

618
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,950
the cingulate or anterior
cingulate cortex, and the insula,

619
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,960
and those three are working together

620
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,220
in a kind of conversation,

621
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,130
it's a neural conversation,
but a conversation nonetheless,

622
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,740
trying to figure out, okay,
what's going on inside me?

623
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,170
How do I feel? What am I thinking about?

624
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,640
And this could be thoughts about the past

625
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,143
or the future or the present.

626
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,170
They are also in a conversation

627
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,180
as to whether or not the sensations

628
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,710
that you're experiencing,

629
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,390
meaning how quick your breathing is

630
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,920
or how slow your breathing is,

631
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,040
how your heart feels, how your skin feels,

632
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,640
any sensations of pain, or
pleasure for that matter,

633
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,040
whether or not that makes sense
for the situation you're in

634
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,030
and trying to determine

635
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,670
whether or not you are
doing the right things

636
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,340
as a consequence of those sensations.

637
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,220
Okay, so again, if you
can't remember the names

638
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,990
of these different neural
structures in the brain,

639
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,890
don't worry about it.

640
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,360
It's really not that critical.

641
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,640
What is critical is that you understand

642
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,970
that there's a conversation
that's constantly occurring

643
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,740
as long as you are awake

644
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,100
trying to figure out what's
going on inside of you

645
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,420
and whether or not it makes sense

646
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,570
relative to what's going
on outside and around you.

647
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,920
Now, humans are smart.

648
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,820
That is, we are, to some
extent, conscious of the fact

649
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,290
that we have memories of the
past, awareness of the present,

650
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,390
and anticipation of the future.

651
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,340
So we do realize, for instance,

652
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,130
that we can be seated at
the dinner table, excuse me,

653
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,860
and have a thought about
something tomorrow,

654
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,960
maybe an exam that's stressing us out

655
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,793
or something like that,

656
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,990
and that will change our bodily state

657
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,850
in a way that is not optimal

658
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,590
for what we're doing in the moment

659
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,090
but that can still make sense to us

660
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,440
because that exam is important,

661
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,670
maybe we're feeling some pressure

662
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,350
about a hard conversation we have to have,

663
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,020
or maybe we are very
excited about the next day

664
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,480
and we can't eat because we're so excited,

665
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,860
and that can make perfect sense to us

666
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,160
because we do have access
to this knowledge about self

667
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,930
that we can think about the past,

668
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,610
the present, or the future.

669
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,880
So that makes the conversation
these three structures are in

670
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,890
even more interesting and dynamic

671
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,850
because what it means is that
we can be doing something,

672
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,310
eating, talking, running,

673
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,440
any number of different activities,

674
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,120
and our bodily state may or
may not match what we are doing

675
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,580
in a way that's adaptive for that,

676
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,010
and yet that can be completely okay

677
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,470
or at least understandable for us.

678
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,860
Now, a major emphasis
of a meditation practice

679
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,100
is to make us so-called more mindful.

680
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,060
What is mindfulness?

681
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,680
Well, again, there isn't one perfect

682
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,340
universally accepted operational
definition of mindfulness.

683
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,480
That's basically nerd speak

684
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,930
for saying people can't agree
exactly what mindfulness

685
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,100
should be, is, and means for everyone.

686
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,620
But most people assume, and I think agree,

687
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,880
that mindfulness includes
something about being present.

688
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,930
And when I say present,

689
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,660
that doesn't necessarily mean
present to one's surroundings

690
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,820
because of course a lot
of meditation practices

691
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,190
that are designed to make
us more mindful and present

692
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,840
are designed to make us
more mindful and present

693
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,550
to what's happening internally

694
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,970
while ignoring everything
that's happening externally,

695
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,370
but they are designed
to make us more present

696
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,810
to our bodily sensations

697
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,690
and, in particular, our
breathing and our thoughts

698
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,980
in the moment.

699
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,450
So let's now explore

700
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,610
what a generic meditation
practice looks like,

701
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,090
and let's evaluate how that
tends to change the activity

702
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,920
of these neural circuits
in the brain and body.

703
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,500
And then from there, we
can split the conversation

704
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,120
into a couple of different bins,

705
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,000
that is, meditation
practices that are ideal

706
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
for enhancing focus,

707
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,890
meditation practices that
are ideal for improving mood,

708
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,520
meditation practices that are
ideal for improving sleep,

709
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,090
and meditation practices
that, believe it or not,

710
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,090
benefit all of those
things in one fell swoop.

711
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,310
Okay, so what happens
during a meditation practice

712
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,900
at the neural level?

713
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,610
In order to answer that question,

714
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,960
we are going to be scientists.

715
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,510
That means you and I are
going to be scientists now.

716
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,490
We are going to break down a practice

717
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,040
into its different component parts

718
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,160
and address what we know for sure

719
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,070
about the brain activation
states that occur

720
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,750
with those different component parts.

721
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,583
In order to do that,

722
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,960
let's use a somewhat
generic form of meditation,

723
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,390
but it's generic and pretty far-reaching

724
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,540
because I would say that for most people,

725
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,300
about 75%, let's say,

726
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,600
a meditation practice is
going to involve stopping,

727
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,600
meaning getting out of
motion, sitting or lying down,

728
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,120
and, in most cases, closing one's eyes,

729
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,030
although it is absolutely not required

730
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,680
to close one's eyes during meditation.

731
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,280
There are many forms of meditation
that are done eyes open.

732
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,210
But for most people,

733
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,730
it's going to involve
stopping our movement,

734
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,130
that is, not ambulating,
not walking or running,

735
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,120
so seated or lying down with eyes closed.

736
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,960
When we do that,

737
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,110
meaning when we sit or lie
down and close our eyes,

738
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,840
as trivial as that shift
might sound to you,

739
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,740
it actually is a profound shift
in the way that your brain

740
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,980
and other neural circuits
in your body function

741
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,930
for the following reason.

742
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,120
When we close our eyes,

743
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,120
we shut down a major avenue of
what's called exteroception.

744
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,080
What do I mean by exteroception?

745
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,640
Well, very briefly, we are
sensing things on our body

746
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,260
and in our body all the time.

747
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,930
We are also sensing things from
outside of us all the time,

748
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,930
so these could be sights or
sounds, touch on our body,

749
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,480
sensations withinside our body, et cetera.

750
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,050
Now, sensation is distinct
from what we call perception.

751
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,680
Perception is, put simply,

752
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,100
the sensations that we happen
to be paying attention to.

753
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,010
So at any given moment, you
are sensing many, many things.

754
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,480
There are sound waves hitting your ears,

755
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
there are pressure receptors
on the bottoms of your feet

756
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,000
sensing your shoes or your
sandals or the floor, et cetera,

757
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,440
but you're not perceiving them

758
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,870
until you place your attention on them.

759
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,630
Now, the way perception works

760
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,570
is that you have so-called
spotlights of attention.

761
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,260
You can't perceive everything all at once,

762
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,240
every sound, every sight, every touch.

763
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,670
That would be overwhelming. In
fact, that would be terrible.

764
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,550
Rather you have spotlights of perception

765
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,530
that can either be very narrow,

766
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,363
so for instance,

767
00:29:05,363 --> 00:29:07,620
you could focus all of
your perception right now

768
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,720
on your big toe of your right foot

769
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,800
and really pour all of your
awareness, your attention

770
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,380
into what you're perceiving
there, what it feels like,

771
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,980
if there's tingling or pressure,
heat or cold, et cetera,

772
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,070
or you can broaden that
spotlight to include both feet

773
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,660
or all your toes on both feet

774
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,900
and then your legs and your
whole body or the entire room.

775
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,430
Perception is like a spotlight,

776
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,770
and I should mention
there are very good data

777
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,620
that we can split our attention into two

778
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,560
but probably not more than two spotlights,

779
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,470
and we can make those
spotlights of perception

780
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,500
either very broad and
diffuse or very narrow.

781
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,030
You can practice this now if you like.

782
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,630
You can pick a spot on the
wall away from you anywhere,

783
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,490
or if you're driving, you
can look at some location,

784
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,150
and you can focus intensely
on one small location,

785
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,040
for instance, a tree in the horizon

786
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,510
or a person on the street

787
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,780
or any number of different
things outside of you,

788
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,340
or you can broaden that spotlight

789
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,350
to include the entire scene at once.

790
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,740
You can also focus a spotlight
of perception on your body,

791
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,150
say on the left upper
portion of your chest.

792
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,740
And of course you can focus

793
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,510
on the left upper portion of your chest

794
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,770
and something outside of you,

795
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,030
you can split your attention

796
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,610
between those two perceptual spotlights.

797
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,320
It's very hard, although not impossible,

798
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,690
to have three perceptual spotlights,

799
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,510
but most people can split to two points

800
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,270
of attention or perception pretty easily.

801
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,700
The other thing that most
people can do pretty easily

802
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,160
is merge those two spotlights

803
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,590
or, rather, to have just
one spotlight of attention.

804
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,430
So you don't always have

805
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,140
to have two spotlights of attention on,

806
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,400
and here, I'm using the word attention

807
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,110
and perception interchangeably.

808
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,020
But you could, for instance,
have two points of attention,

809
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,640
so you're talking to somebody
and you're paying attention

810
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,010
to whether or not somebody's
walking in the door or not,

811
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,910
so that's two,

812
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,380
or you could be completely focused

813
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,460
on the person you're talking to,

814
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,770
or you could be completely
focused on the stomach ache

815
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,620
or the great sensation of hunger
that you have in your belly

816
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,670
while talking to somebody,

817
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,930
in fact, you're not even listening

818
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,280
to what they're saying at all.

819
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,470
Okay? So you have two
spotlights of perception.

820
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,560
You can split them or merge them into one.

821
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,510
And, this is very important,

822
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,050
those spotlights of perception
can intensify or dim,

823
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,730
and there, I'm using analogy.

824
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,700
What I mean by that is your
perception of what's happening

825
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,930
within those spotlights can
be very, very high acuity.

826
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,110
That is, you can register
very fine changes in detail

827
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,410
like tingling on one side of
your big toe of your right foot

828
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,460
versus the other,

829
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,170
or it can be somewhat more diffuse.

830
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,670
You're just thinking about your whole toe,

831
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,500
which, in that case,
seems like a small area,

832
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,820
but the point is that you can
consciously adjust the acuity,

833
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,820
that is, the fineness of your perception.

834
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,620
All of this is under your power

835
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,470
because of the incredible
ability of a brain structure

836
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,990
whose name you now understand and know,

837
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,870
which is the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex,

838
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,460
although there are other
areas of your brain

839
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,630
involved as well.

840
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,170
Your ability to direct your
attention to specific things

841
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,510
in your environment or within your body

842
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,660
or to split those points
of attention or merge them

843
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,220
or dial up the intensity

844
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,380
of how closely you're paying attention

845
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,600
to every little shift or ripple

846
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,940
and change in sensation there

847
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,790
or to kind of dissociate, if you will,

848
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,870
for lack of a better word,

849
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,180
to disengage from that perception,

850
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,910
all of that is under control
because of your ability

851
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,000
to engage this area that we
call the prefrontal cortex,

852
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,480
and, in particular, the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

853
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,860
I'd like to take a quick break

854
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,890
and acknowledge one of our
sponsors, Athletic Greens.

855
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,380
Athletic Greens, now called AG1,

856
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,720
is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink

857
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,630
that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.

858
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,330
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,

859
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,550
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

860
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,140
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

861
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,210
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

862
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,190
once or usually twice a day

863
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:52,110
is that it gets me the probiotics

864
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,790
that I need for gut health.

865
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,900
Our gut is very important.

866
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,450
It's populated by gut microbiota

867
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,220
that communicate with the
brain, the immune system,

868
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,590
and basically all the
biological systems of our body

869
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,250
to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health,

870
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,110
and those probiotics in Athletic Greens

871
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,920
are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.

872
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,780
In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number

873
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,910
of adaptogens, vitamins,
and minerals that make sure

874
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,850
that all of my foundational
nutritional needs are met,

875
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,740
and it tastes great.

876
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,210
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

877
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,600
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

878
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,580
and they'll give you
five free travel packs

879
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,860
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

880
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,180
while you're on the road, in the car,

881
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,470
on the plane, et cetera,

882
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,890
and they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3+K2.

883
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,560
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

884
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,940
to get the five free travel packs

885
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,940
and the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.

886
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,610
Okay, so now if we look at
the example of what happens

887
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,460
when you sit or lie
down and close your eyes

888
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,200
and decide to meditate,

889
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,760
you should immediately realize

890
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,280
that that's a tremendous shift

891
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,010
in your perceptual ability, why?

892
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,200
Because that spotlight of attention,

893
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,150
while it can be oriented

894
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,760
toward, for instance,
what you hear in the room

895
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,120
or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees

896
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,010
in the environment that
you happen to be in,

897
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,600
when we close our eyes,

898
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,440
we shut down one of the major
avenues for sensory input,

899
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,403
which is vision.

900
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,739
And when we do that,

901
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,799
there's a tendency for
those perceptual spotlights

902
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,190
to be focused more so on what happens

903
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,889
at the level of the surface of our skin

904
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,499
and inside of our bodies.

905
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,590
And that informs us about
something very important,

906
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,929
which is that there are actually two axes

907
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,899
or two ends of a continuum of perception.

908
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,489
Up until now, I've been
talking about perception

909
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,109
and intention as kind of the same thing,

910
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,230
and indeed they are, at least
for sake of this conversation,

911
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,420
but within that word perception

912
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,750
or within that word attention,
there's a continuum,

913
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,540
and that continuum has on one end

914
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,760
something called interoception.

915
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,803
Interoception, spelled with an I,

916
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,110
is everything that we sense

917
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,660
at the level of our skin and inward,

918
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,310
so the sensation inside our stomach,

919
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,990
the sensation of our heart beating.

920
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,060
Some people can sense their
heart beating pretty easily.

921
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,523
Other people have more
challenge doing that.

922
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,730
What we are feeling on
the surface of our skin,

923
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,123
how hot or cold we feel,
that's interoception.

924
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,480
In contrast, at the other
end of the continuum

925
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,720
is so-called exteroception,
spelled with an E.

926
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,810
Exteroception is perception of everything

927
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,830
that's outside or beyond
the confines of our skin.

928
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,540
So by shutting our eyes,

929
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,060
and in particular, in
a meditative practice

930
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,740
where we direct our attention

931
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,480
toward our so-called third eye center,

932
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,010
this area right behind our forehead,

933
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,550
which, not so incidentally,
is the prefrontal cortex,

934
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,640
or in some cases where people
will focus on their breathing,

935
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,110
so the movement of their stomach

936
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,460
or the movement of their diaphragm

937
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,780
or the lifting of their chest

938
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,060
or the extension of their
belly while they breathe.

939
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,620
By doing that,

940
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,820
we are taking what ordinarily
is a perceptual state

941
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,230
that's split between the
outside world, exteroception,

942
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,810
and usually also toward our inner state.

943
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,580
You know, most people
are generally in touch

944
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,950
with how they are feeling
from the skin inward

945
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,600
while they are also paying attention

946
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,040
to what's outside of them.

947
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,873
You can think about somebody,

948
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:14,100
for instance, at a
restaurant or a sandwich shop

949
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,990
about to order a sandwich
and you're reading the menu,

950
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,400
so that's exteroception, right?

951
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,620
The menu is outside the
confines of your skin.

952
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,950
And little ideas or maybe
big ideas come to mind

953
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,330
about what the roast beef sandwich

954
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,730
or the vegetarian
sandwich will taste like,

955
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,290
what it will do for you,

956
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,110
what's in it, what you like,
what you don't like, et cetera.

957
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,620
That's splitting interoception
and exteroception.

958
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,140
But when we close our eyes,
we stop, we slow down,

959
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,320
we focus on our breathing
or that third eye center,

960
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,130
the majority of our perception
then shifts to interoception.

961
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,870
And when we shift down

962
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,900
to that end of the
continuum of interoception,

963
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,970
something very important happens.

964
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,940
What happens is that those two regions,

965
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,450
the ACC, the anterior cingulate
cortex, and the insula,

966
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,450
really ramp up their
levels of neural activity,

967
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,920
and that should make perfect sense to you

968
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,280
because those are areas of
your brain that are registering

969
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,740
and paying attention to
the various sensations

970
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,980
of how full or empty your stomach feels,

971
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,680
whether or not the surface of
your skin feels hot or cold,

972
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,760
and on and on.

973
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,820
So by just sitting down or lying
down and closing your eyes,

974
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,950
your brain undergoes a massive shift

975
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,590
from exteroception to interoception.

976
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,330
Now, that's not to say
you can't be distracted

977
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,640
by external events, and,
in fact, many people are,

978
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,440
but the early stages of transitioning

979
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,150
into a meditative state

980
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,150
involve this shift down the continuum,

981
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,920
or, I should say, to
one end of the continuum

982
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,100
because there's no down-up,
there's just the continuum,

983
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,660
shift along the continuum

984
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,420
to heightened levels of interoception.

985
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,980
Now, I mentioned this briefly before,

986
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,980
but many people are very
interoceptively aware

987
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,440
just naturally, even if they
don't do a meditation practice.

988
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,000
Other people are not.

989
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,040
And there's a pretty good measure

990
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,690
of whether or not you have high levels

991
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,090
of interoceptive awareness or capability,

992
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,460
and that is your ability
to count your heartbeats

993
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,550
without placing your fingers
anywhere with any pressure

994
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,380
to take your pulse.

995
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,520
You can do this if you like,

996
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,130
you can actually try and estimate
your number of heartbeats

997
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,320
simply by trying to feel your heart beat.

998
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,760
Some people are very good,

999
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,680
meaning they're very
accurate at doing this,

1000
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,910
other people are not.

1001
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,680
It does seem to be an ability

1002
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,630
that can be trained up quite a bit,

1003
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,100
and, in fact, meditative practices

1004
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,530
will improve your interoceptive awareness,

1005
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,683
but, and this is a very important point,

1006
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,710
heightened levels of
interoceptive awareness,

1007
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,690
while that might sound attractive,

1008
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,840
oh, to be really in touch with your body,

1009
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,050
that is not always beneficial, why?

1010
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,790
Because many people who, for instance,

1011
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,670
have excessive levels of anxiety

1012
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,770
have excessive levels of anxiety

1013
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,170
because they are very keenly aware

1014
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,050
of any subtle shift in their
heart rate or breathing

1015
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,260
or change in the sensations
within their stomach.

1016
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,060
Whereas other people who are less aware

1017
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,030
of their bodily state, that
can be beneficial, right?

1018
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,000
It can be adaptive or not,
depending on the circumstances.

1019
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,980
It's probably not adaptive

1020
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,280
to be very, very aware
of your internal state

1021
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,960
if, for instance, you're
doing public speaking,

1022
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,793
you don't want to be thinking

1023
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:11,730
about what's going on in your stomach

1024
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,960
or how quickly you're breathing.

1025
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,600
I'm certainly trying to
ignore all those signals,

1026
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,340
those sensations now.

1027
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,730
But for somebody who has no
awareness of what's going on,

1028
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,040
very little interoceptive awareness,

1029
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,900
that can be problematic, too,

1030
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,550
because these are the very people

1031
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,500
who can ignore the fact that
they're having a heart attack

1032
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,410
or can ignore the fact that
they have high blood pressure

1033
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,230
and are carrying about life
focused on everything external

1034
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,910
with no awareness of their own body.

1035
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,730
They're, quote, unquote, out
of touch with their body.

1036
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,990
So we want to be very careful
about placing valence,

1037
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,270
which is a sort of value of good or bad

1038
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,270
on interoceptive awareness
versus exteroceptive awareness.

1039
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,890
More importantly, we want to emphasize

1040
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,650
that when you undergo
a meditation practice,

1041
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,930
if it's of the sort where
you stop your movement

1042
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,340
and close your eyes,

1043
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,370
you are training for
interoceptive awareness.

1044
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,730
This becomes important later
when we get into discussions

1045
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,060
about meditation for reducing anxiety.

1046
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,430
Some people may opt,

1047
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,740
in fact, I would say
some people ought to opt

1048
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,880
for a meditative practice

1049
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,820
which involves more
exteroceptive awareness,

1050
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,100
actually a meditation
like a walking meditation

1051
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,570
or even a seated meditation

1052
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,040
where they are bringing their focus

1053
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,680
to a place outside their body

1054
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,510
as opposed to inside their body.

1055
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,730
And in fact, there are examples of people

1056
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,410
who have meditated quite a lot

1057
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,140
who develop such a
heightened state or awareness

1058
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,480
of their interoceptive components,

1059
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,430
that is, just fancy, again, nerd speak

1060
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,400
for so aware of their
breathing and of their heart

1061
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,230
and of the state of their gut

1062
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,200
that it actually is intrusive
for daily activities.

1063
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,280
So I will ask you to ask this
question of yourself now.

1064
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,130
Are you somebody who
tends to be very in touch

1065
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,930
with your bodily sensations,

1066
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,420
so, for instance, from the skin inwards?

1067
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,150
Or are you somebody who tends
to be less in touch with

1068
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,360
or aware of your interoceptive state?

1069
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,860
There is no right or wrong answer.

1070
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,870
You don't get an A or an F or a D or a C

1071
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,890
depending on your answer.

1072
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,420
It's just a good question

1073
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,130
for each and every one of us to answer,

1074
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,280
and I think most people
will answer that it depends.

1075
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,680
It depends on whether or not
you are in a social setting

1076
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,090
or whether or not you're alone.

1077
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,240
But we are going to return to
that answer so keep it in mind

1078
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,310
because it will become very beneficial

1079
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,700
in building an optimal
meditation practice for you.

1080
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,780
But for now, just note,

1081
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,601
there's this continuum of perception,

1082
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,230
interoception and exteroception.

1083
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,180
Closing your eyes increases interoception.

1084
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,510
Opening your eyes dramatically
increases exteroception

1085
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,950
just automatically,

1086
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,840
just automatically because
so much of your brain,

1087
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,390
in fact, 40% or more,
is dedicated to vision.

1088
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,980
And this, I should say, for those of you

1089
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,390
that are low vision or no vision

1090
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,030
and those of you that are
blind or have poor vision,

1091
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,780
this entire process is
translated to the auditory,

1092
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,863
to the sound domain,

1093
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,980
so it's true for people that can see

1094
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,900
and it's true for people that can't see.

1095
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,640
Of course, people that
can't see, closing the eyes

1096
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,490
doesn't have this huge
shift towards interoception,

1097
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,560
but there have been a few studies,

1098
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,120
not as many as I would've liked to find,

1099
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,480
but a few studies of, for
instance, people who are blind

1100
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,280
or have low vision, don't see very well,

1101
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,170
and when they close their ears

1102
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,060
and they can't hear the external world

1103
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,490
or they put headphones on or
noise-canceling headphones,

1104
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,940
then the world inside of
them becomes very prominent

1105
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,670
relative to the world outside
of them for obvious reasons.

1106
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,080
So I asked you to ask yourself

1107
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,220
whether or not you are somebody

1108
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,730
who tends to be more
interoceptively aware or not,

1109
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,580
more exteroceptively aware or not.

1110
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,800
And some of you might not be
able to answer that question,

1111
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,990
and if you can't, chances are

1112
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,750
that you are effectively
sliding along that continuum

1113
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,910
depending on the activities
that you're doing.

1114
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,500
So you're probably the kind of person

1115
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,850
where if somebody comes over to you

1116
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,683
and starts talking to you,

1117
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:44,640
you will engage in that conversation,

1118
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,220
and you don't feel so inside your body

1119
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,960
that you're thinking
about your heart beating

1120
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,610
and whether or not you're
flushing red, et cetera,

1121
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,350
you're going to pay
attention to what they say.

1122
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,620
Many people, however, when
somebody talks to them,

1123
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,300
if they have social anxiety

1124
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,640
or even a slight bit of social anxiety,

1125
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,560
will be thinking about whether or not

1126
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,520
their cheeks are flushing

1127
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,920
or whether or not they
look right or sound right

1128
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,510
or whether or not they have
something in their teeth.

1129
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,310
These are normal responses,

1130
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,290
but they really speak to this issue

1131
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,910
of whether or not you tend to shift

1132
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,530
more towards interoceptive awareness

1133
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,790
or exteroceptive awareness.

1134
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:16,410
And, of course, it's context dependent.

1135
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,520
It will depend on whether or not

1136
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
you're, you know, out
on a date with somebody

1137
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,840
that, you know, you would
loathe to find out later

1138
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,760
that you had food in your teeth

1139
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,810
or whether or not you're with somebody

1140
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,680
you're more familiar with

1141
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,570
where that would not really matter much

1142
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,910
or the other person would
tell you this kind of thing.

1143
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,630
What does it mean to be at one
location or another location

1144
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,080
along this continuum of
interoception or exteroception?

1145
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,330
Well, we know what it
means neurally, right?

1146
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,480
We know that if you are
more interoceptively aware,

1147
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,150
your insula and ACC are active,
but that's not very useful.

1148
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,000
That's not helpful as a
tool. That's just a fact.

1149
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,130
Now, there have actually been studies

1150
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,950
of what a meditation practice can do

1151
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:56,010
in terms of moving you
along this continuum

1152
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,640
from where you naturally sit

1153
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,510
in order to help you function

1154
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,600
not just during the
meditation but at all times.

1155
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,610
And in order to illustrate this,

1156
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,720
I want to start with a description

1157
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,060
of what is now a classic study.

1158
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,610
It's a very cool study,
it has a very cool name.

1159
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,650
It talks about something very important

1160
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,447
that will come up again and
again in today's conversation,

1161
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,420
and that's something called
the default mode network.

1162
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,440
The default mode network

1163
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,390
is a collection of different brain areas

1164
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,590
that essentially are active

1165
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,570
when we're not doing much of anything

1166
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,200
and certainly is active
when we are not focused

1167
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,710
on one particular task or
conversation or activity.

1168
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,010
The default mode network can
be thought of more or less

1169
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,250
as the network that
generates mind wandering

1170
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,310
or our thoughts drifting from the past

1171
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,790
to the present to the future.

1172
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,050
Remember, earlier, I talked about

1173
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,970
how your perceptual spotlight

1174
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,790
can either be two spotlights
or they can merge.

1175
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,830
Well, similarly, human beings

1176
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,630
can think about the past, surely,

1177
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,200
the present, definitely, and the future.

1178
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,410
And it turns out we can
also split our thoughts

1179
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,450
just like we can split our perception

1180
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,670
into two of those three things,

1181
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,310
so I can think about
the past, a past event,

1182
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,540
and I can think about the present.

1183
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,270
I can split my thinking
and my memory in that way.

1184
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,160
I can also think about the
present and the future.

1185
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,190
I can also think about
the future and the past,

1186
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,730
although it's very difficult,
although not impossible,

1187
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,980
to split one's thinking and memory

1188
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,620
into the past, the present,
and future simultaneously,

1189
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,880
not easily done,

1190
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,360
but pretty easy to split
one's attention and thinking

1191
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,920
into two of those three things,

1192
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,350
either the past, the
present, and the future

1193
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,140
or any two of those three things, okay?

1194
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,910
Just like with attentional spotlighting,

1195
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,790
you can place your mind, your
thinking, and your memory,

1196
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,640
your cognition onto one of those things

1197
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,260
and be very, very present

1198
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,320
or the past and the present
and so on and so forth.

1199
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,540
The default mode network,

1200
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,610
while it involves a lot
of different brain areas,

1201
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,780
can be thought of simply as
the network of brain areas

1202
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,480
that are active when
your mind is wandering

1203
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,220
between these different time domains.

1204
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,780
And the paper I'd like to share with you,

1205
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,580
as I mentioned before,
is now a classic paper,

1206
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,800
it has a wonderful title,

1207
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,220
which is A Wandering
Mind is an Unhappy Mind.

1208
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,960
Now, that sounds almost
like a news article

1209
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,600
or a news article about
a scientific paper,

1210
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,820
but that's actually the
title of the scientific paper

1211
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,950
which was published in
the journal, "Science,"

1212
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,080
which is one of the three apex journals.

1213
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,210
You know, scientific
publishing is competitive,

1214
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,950
but it's especially competitive

1215
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,880
to get manuscripts accepted
into "Science," into "Nature,"

1216
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,050
and into the journal "Cell,"

1217
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:32,310
so it represents kind of the
Super Bowl, NBA Championships,

1218
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,047
and Stanley Cup, if you will,

1219
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:36,690
for you sports aficionados
of scientific publishing.

1220
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,600
This is a paper from Matthew
Killingsworth and Dan Gilbert.

1221
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,610
It was published in 2010,

1222
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,110
but it's still considered a classic.

1223
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,720
And this paper, A Wandering
Mind is an Unhappy Mind,

1224
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,160
has a number of very important points.

1225
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,680
I'm going to paraphrase
certain elements of it for you

1226
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,260
because they say essentially
what I would like you to know

1227
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,960
far better than I could say.

1228
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,450
So first of all, they
started out with a statement,

1229
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,730
which I confess I disagree with,

1230
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,560
which is, "Unlike other animals,

1231
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,120
human beings spend a lot of time

1232
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,670
thinking about what is
not going on around them:

1233
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,770
contemplating events that
happened in the past,

1234
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,830
might happen in the future,
or will never happen at all."

1235
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,710
I agree with their assertion
that human beings do that.

1236
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,300
That's certainly my experience,

1237
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,530
although I must say,

1238
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,960
I don't think there's
any evidence whatsoever

1239
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,570
that other animals don't do it also.

1240
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,880
So my apologies,
Killingsworth and Gilbert,

1241
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,620
but I'd be happy to go
toe-to-toe with you on that.

1242
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,190
I am not aware of any data
that prove one way or the other

1243
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,963
what other animals are thinking.

1244
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,020
So let's set aside other animals,

1245
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,480
and let's focus on the human animal.

1246
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,060
Now, their point is still a very good one,

1247
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,450
which is that humans have
this wandering of the mind

1248
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,430
that they call
stimulus-independent thought.

1249
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,250
That is, there's nothing
happening to create these thoughts

1250
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,740
or anything happening in
the immediate environment.

1251
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,440
These thoughts are just happening
on their own internally.

1252
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,900
That's the default mode network.

1253
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,280
This study was important.

1254
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,570
In fact, it was a landmark study

1255
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,310
because they did it right about the time

1256
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:03,330
that smartphones became
widely available and in use,

1257
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,620
so again, 2010.

1258
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,780
So they basically pinged people,

1259
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,780
they contacted people on their
iPhones many times per day,

1260
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:16,020
and they did this for
well over 2,200 adults.

1261
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,830
They had a mix of male and
female people in this study.

1262
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,050
The mean age was 34 years,
but there was a range,

1263
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,670
mean, of course, being average,

1264
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,610
but there were a range of
different ages and so forth.

1265
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,147
And at any moment, they asked people,

1266
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:29,940
"What are you feeling right now?"

1267
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,580
And they also asked them,
"What are you doing right now?"

1268
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,650
So they were looking for
the match or mismatch

1269
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,750
between what people were doing
and what they were feeling.

1270
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,190
They were essentially trying to probe

1271
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,750
what people were thinking about,

1272
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,370
and they also addressed that.

1273
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:45,600
And they came up with a kind
of a bubble chart, if you will,

1274
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,370
where the bigger the bubble,

1275
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,460
the more answers came back
about one particular thing,

1276
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,810
and they assessed whether or not

1277
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,330
people were happy or not in
that moment, or sad or not,

1278
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,260
whether or not they were focused

1279
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,700
on what they were doing or not.

1280
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,080
There are a lot of bubbles in this chart,

1281
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,460
so I'm not going to read them all.

1282
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,340
But the important points
that came from the data,

1283
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,260
and, again, this is a very large data set,

1284
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,150
was that, and here
again, I'm paraphrasing,

1285
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,220
first, people's minds wandered frequently

1286
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,143
regardless of what they were doing.

1287
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,370
In nearly half of the samples taken,

1288
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,710
people were generally
thinking about something else,

1289
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,940
except, it turns out,

1290
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,930
there's this one little bubble

1291
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,570
sitting way far out on the horizon here,

1292
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,810
people claimed, and I'm
inclined to believe them,

1293
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,200
that they tend to be very
focused on making love

1294
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,880
if they were making love in the moment

1295
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,080
where they were pinged on their iPhone.

1296
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,510
Now, why their iPhone was
there with them at that moment,

1297
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:34,343
I don't know.

1298
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:37,410
That wasn't included in this
description of the study.

1299
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,870
But all the other activities,
grooming and self-care,

1300
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,260
listening to the news,
watching television,

1301
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,410
relaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera,

1302
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,730
during all those activities,

1303
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,920
people claimed that their
mind wandered a lot.

1304
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,380
And then they also assessed,
of course, their mood

1305
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,950
and how those people
felt at any given moment

1306
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,180
depending on what they were doing

1307
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,930
and how well their mind and their emotions

1308
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,340
matched what they were doing.

1309
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,993
And what they say here is second,

1310
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,900
they revealed that people were less happy

1311
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,330
when their minds were wandering
than when they were not,

1312
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,480
and this was true during all activities.

1313
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,980
And then third, what people
were thinking at a given moment

1314
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,490
was far better a predictor
of their happiness

1315
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,900
than what they were doing.

1316
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,950
So this is interesting

1317
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,500
and I think matches a lot
of people's experience.

1318
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,480
In fact, I think as you
hear about this study,

1319
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,880
many of you will probably
just say, "Well, duh."

1320
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,393
I mean, if you're working
and you don't like your work

1321
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:34,230
and you're thinking about
something bad that happened,

1322
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:37,080
well, then of course you're
not going to be happy.

1323
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,520
But the key point of this study

1324
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,690
is that it did not necessarily
have to be the case

1325
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,940
that people were thinking
about something unpleasant.

1326
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,760
In fact, if people were working

1327
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,500
and they were thinking
about something else

1328
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,730
that was pleasant, that
also made them feel unhappy.

1329
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,330
In other words, the mismatch
between being in an activity

1330
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,520
and having our mind elsewhere

1331
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,530
led people to report themselves

1332
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,690
as feeling more unhappy in that moment.

1333
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,970
And when you total this up,
what you find is that people

1334
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,670
are often not present
to what they are doing,

1335
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,800
and that is a great source of unhappiness,

1336
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,800
even if their thoughts are
those of happy, joyful thoughts.

1337
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,980
So this is interesting

1338
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,610
and I think runs counter to
what most of us have heard

1339
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,443
or have been taught,

1340
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:23,130
which is, you know, think good thoughts,

1341
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,720
you know, try and suppress bad thoughts,

1342
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,670
have a good internal landscape,

1343
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,260
you know, create a good narrative.

1344
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,210
That is all true, but
equally if not more important

1345
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:36,120
is to have the ability to be fully engaged

1346
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,040
in what you are doing at a given moment.

1347
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,010
That is the strongest
predictor of being happy.

1348
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,600
And there were several other studies

1349
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,590
that followed up on this,

1350
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,730
but their conclusion that they put

1351
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,410
in the final short paragraph of this paper

1352
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,180
I think really captures it beautifully.

1353
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,537
They say, and here, I'm quoting directly,

1354
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:52,920
"In conclusion, a human
mind is a wandering mind,

1355
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,650
and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.

1356
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,230
The ability to think about
what is not happening

1357
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,547
in a moment," I added
the in a moment part,

1358
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:02,940
"is a cognitive achievement

1359
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,920
that comes at an emotional cost."

1360
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,950
So I know I'm not alone in
believing that this paper,

1361
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,420
A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind,

1362
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,890
and we will provide a link to this paper

1363
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,180
in the show note captions,

1364
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,820
is absolutely key in understanding

1365
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,130
why a meditation practice is so important

1366
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,410
because a meditation practice

1367
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,990
is really about adjusting your place

1368
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,220
along that
interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum

1369
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,660
to what you happen to be
experiencing in that moment.

1370
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,820
And while most people think
of a meditative practice

1371
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,520
as focusing on what's going on internally

1372
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,110
with your eyes closed, third eye center,

1373
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,580
focusing on your breathing, et cetera,

1374
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,480
for any number of minutes or
maybe even an hour or longer,

1375
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,220
there are other forms of meditation

1376
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,500
in which your exteroception dominates

1377
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,400
and which you are actively
focusing on things outside

1378
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,090
or beyond the confines of your
skin and internal landscape,

1379
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,210
and that, too, is meditation.

1380
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,780
And if we are to take the work
of Killingsworth and Gilbert,

1381
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,900
this A Wandering Mind is
an Unhappy Mind, seriously,

1382
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,910
and I know a number of
other laboratories have

1383
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,340
and have supported this
research with their findings

1384
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,870
again and again and again,

1385
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,690
what this means is that meditating

1386
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,670
is not necessarily a practice that we do

1387
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:17,220
divorced from the rest of life.

1388
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,290
Meditation and mindfulness in particular,

1389
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,970
being present to what we
are doing in a given moment

1390
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,450
is one of the essential keys
to happiness and improved mood

1391
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,360
even if what we are doing is unpleasant.

1392
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,830
So that brings us to a tool,

1393
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,900
and it's a tool that any
and all of us can use

1394
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,900
whether or not you tend to
be interoceptively dominant,

1395
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,640
right, that you tend to pay more attention

1396
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,150
to your bodily sensations,
or exteroceptively dominant.

1397
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,460
And, again, if you don't know
the answer to that question,

1398
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,200
there's a simple test that you can do.

1399
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,410
You can just sit down or
lie down, close your eyes,

1400
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:53,010
and you can ask yourself or assess

1401
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,890
whether or not your
attention tends to fleet

1402
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,860
to things outside of you, right,

1403
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,160
cars honking or going
by, people in the room,

1404
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,960
or whether or not you
tend to be able to focus

1405
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,190
on your internal landscape

1406
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,740
to the exclusion of exteroception
and attention to things

1407
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,140
outside the confines of your skin easily.

1408
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,810
Now, of course, this will
depend on context and situation,

1409
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,850
even how well rested you are, et cetera,

1410
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,590
but that's exactly the point.

1411
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,230
This is the sort of thing you want to do

1412
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,440
every time you decide to
do a meditation practice.

1413
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,340
In fact, I would suggest that you use this

1414
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:30,150
to determine what meditation
you do at any given moment.

1415
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,640
So let's say you are somebody
who is a regular meditator

1416
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,650
or let's say you're somebody
who's never meditated

1417
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,260
and you'd like to develop
a meditation practice.

1418
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,380
I suggest that you do a test

1419
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,960
of whether or not you are
more interoceptively dominant

1420
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,380
or exteroceptively
dominant in that moment.

1421
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,510
Again, this is not a personality trait.

1422
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,300
This is a question about where
you happen to be in a moment.

1423
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,760
So let's say you're on a
plane or you're in the car.

1424
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,593
If you're in the car,

1425
00:54:54,593 --> 00:54:55,560
please don't close your
eyes while driving,

1426
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,520
that's sort of obvious, but
do this in a safe way, please.

1427
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,610
But stop, close your eyes,

1428
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,700
and assess whether or not you can access

1429
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,750
and focus your attention
primarily on your internal state

1430
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,210
or whether or not your
attention and perception

1431
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,930
gets pulled to something
external, to exteroception.

1432
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,910
And, again, that will vary

1433
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,040
depending on circumstance and who you are.

1434
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,110
Then I suggest opening your eyes

1435
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,910
and trying to focus your attention

1436
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,070
to something external to you

1437
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,350
and seeing or evaluating the extent

1438
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,260
to which you can divorce your perception

1439
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,150
from sensations that occur

1440
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,700
at the level of your skin or internally.

1441
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,740
Now, I should say that
there's no technology,

1442
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,820
at least not that I'm aware
of, absence of fMRI machine,

1443
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,890
in which case, you are
inside an fMRI machine

1444
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,730
while you do this.

1445
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:46,470
But unless you are in that experiment,

1446
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,330
and most of us aren't,

1447
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,480
there's no technology that
can tell you, for instance,

1448
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,520
whether or not you are
interoceptively dominant

1449
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,900
or exteroceptively dominant

1450
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,170
and whether or not the
ratio is, you know, 75 to 25

1451
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,910
or what have you at any given moment.

1452
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,040
You have to assess this subjectively.

1453
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,590
However, if you sit down, for instance,

1454
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,630
and you notice that you can
equally split your attention

1455
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,810
between internal sensations
and external sensations

1456
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,010
or whether or not you find yourself

1457
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,510
pulled into external sensations

1458
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,310
when you're trying to focus inward

1459
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,800
or you find yourself pulled inward

1460
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,240
when you're trying to focus outward,

1461
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,220
well, that will dictate
the sort of meditation

1462
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,343
that you perhaps ought to
perform in that moment.

1463
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,460
Let me give an example
of how you would do this.

1464
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,080
You would stop in some way,

1465
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,210
so sit or lie down, close your eyes,

1466
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:35,130
and evaluate whether or not
you can essentially rule out

1467
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,550
or eliminate attention
to all outside events.

1468
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,560
Most people won't be
able to do that entirely,

1469
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,760
but try and focus your attention,

1470
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,680
for instance, on your breathing

1471
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,100
or the typical third eye center,

1472
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,470
you know, focusing at a spot
right behind your forehead.

1473
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,240
If you feel you can do
that reasonably well

1474
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,640
to the exclusion of what's
happening around you,

1475
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,670
well, then an important question arises.

1476
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:55,260
Should you meditate in a way

1477
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,720
to enhance that interoceptive awareness?

1478
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,060
Or rather, should you meditate in a way,

1479
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,620
for instance, with your eyes open

1480
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,420
and your attention on a particular portion

1481
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,470
of the landscape you're in

1482
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,910
like a tree or maybe even,
you know, an object or a plant

1483
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,950
or something else in your
immediate environment

1484
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,360
to try and cultivate

1485
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,820
or enhance your exteroceptive awareness?

1486
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,640
That's up to you, but my bias would be one

1487
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,610
in which you work against
your default state.

1488
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,360
Again, the default mode
network is where you land

1489
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,273
on this interoceptive-exteroceptive
continuum.

1490
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:29,760
It's going to lead to more mind wandering,

1491
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,920
whereas when you encourage

1492
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,200
or we could even say force
yourself a little bit

1493
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,820
to anchor your attention

1494
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,313
to either inside your
body or outside your body,

1495
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,590
and you make that decision

1496
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,833
according to what you
are doing less easily,

1497
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:48,690
well, then you are actively
training up the neural circuits.

1498
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,700
You are engaging
so-called neuroplasticity,

1499
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,920
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

1500
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,150
You are deliberately engaging a shift

1501
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,560
along that continuum.

1502
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,300
To make this crystal
clear, what I mean is this.

1503
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,550
Let me give an example.

1504
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:05,040
If I were to sit down and I
wanted to do some meditation,

1505
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,630
let's just say three
minutes of meditation.

1506
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:09,090
There's good evidence that even
three minutes of meditation

1507
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,950
can be beneficial for a variety of things,

1508
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:15,180
including enhanced focus and
enhanced anxiety management.

1509
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,020
Let's say I sit down

1510
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,690
and I notice that I
can really focus inward

1511
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:21,150
on what's happening at
the level of my skin

1512
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:24,990
and my internal organs, and
I can rule out everything.

1513
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:26,370
Maybe that's 'cause the room is quiet

1514
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,950
or maybe it's just because
my brain is in a state

1515
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,920
that I'm particularly good
at that at that moment

1516
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,930
or maybe it's just a natural ability.

1517
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:37,020
Well then I would opt for a
three-minute meditation practice

1518
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,050
in which I deliberately exterocept,

1519
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,880
that I build up the circuitry

1520
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,400
to focus on something external to me

1521
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,220
because I want, and I think
most people would like,

1522
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,400
to have an adaptive mechanism within them

1523
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,470
so that they can slide
along that continuum

1524
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:54,150
and they don't default

1525
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,720
to whatever happens to be
easiest for them in that moment.

1526
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,100
Now, if I were to sit down

1527
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,110
and try and focus on
what's going on internally

1528
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,280
and I kept getting distracted

1529
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,720
by things happening outside of me,

1530
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,270
opening my eyes or feeling like
I need to reach for my phone

1531
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,310
or paying attention to
the sounds in the room,

1532
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,970
well, then I would actively
engage a meditation practice,

1533
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,070
in this case, a three-minute
example but it could be longer,

1534
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:17,790
where I'm deliberately
trying to focus my perception

1535
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,580
on events at the level of
the confines of my skin

1536
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,810
and internally.

1537
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,643
Why do I say this?

1538
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:26,700
Well, you know, I love to use
the phrase anytime with kids,

1539
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,320
you know, when they say
"This is really hard

1540
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,340
or something's challenging,"

1541
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,140
or adults will say, "That's really tough."

1542
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,690
Well, as my graduate advisor used to say,

1543
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,100
that means you're learning.

1544
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,270
If something were easy,

1545
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,210
if you can perform any
activity or thought, et cetera,

1546
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,640
well, then there is absolutely zero reason

1547
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,650
for your neural circuits to change.

1548
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:46,380
It's the friction, it's the
feeling that something is hard

1549
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,560
that turns on the enormous
variety of mechanisms

1550
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,180
at the level of cells, et cetera,

1551
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,150
that allow you to potentially
change your neural circuitry.

1552
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,910
So challenge and discomfort

1553
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:59,370
is the signal to your brain and body

1554
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,050
that something needs to change,

1555
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:05,190
so I'm encouraging you to
embark on meditative practices

1556
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:08,610
that are not your default, okay?

1557
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,340
To essentially go against the grain

1558
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:15,030
of where your interoceptive
bias or your exteroceptive bias

1559
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:16,710
happens to be at a given moment.

1560
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,730
And, again, this will change.

1561
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:20,010
For some of you, this
will change across the day

1562
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,280
where early in the day,
you are very, very good

1563
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,190
at doing an
interoceptive-biased meditation,

1564
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,470
and later in the day, you aren't.

1565
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,600
I actually believe, based on
the data that I've covered,

1566
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,090
and we'll get into a few
more papers about this,

1567
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,610
and my lab is actively
working on this as well,

1568
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:40,610
that a meditative practice can
be made far more effective,

1569
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,100
that is, it can invoke
more neuroplasticity,

1570
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:48,060
more shift in brain
states and brain circuitry

1571
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,750
if we do not take the easy path,

1572
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:54,780
that is, we go against the grain

1573
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,810
of what our brain would
naturally do in a given moment.

1574
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,280
So if you're in a crowded airport

1575
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,650
and you're finding that
everything's very distracting,

1576
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,200
well, then that would be a great time

1577
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,900
to do some interoceptive
focused meditation.

1578
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,223
Whereas if you are really in your head,

1579
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:10,140
you know, you're looping thoughts

1580
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,220
about the past and present,

1581
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,140
maybe you're even in obsessive thought,

1582
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,440
well, that would be a terrific
time, an ideal time really,

1583
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,690
to do a short meditation

1584
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,880
focused on something external to you.

1585
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,830
In both cases, whether
or not you're focused

1586
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:26,043
on interoceptive bias
or exteroceptive bias,

1587
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,210
you are going against, or I
should say you're pushing back

1588
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,370
against your default mode network.

1589
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:35,310
I would argue it's going
to be far more effective,

1590
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:38,430
that is, you're going to
reduce or shift the activity

1591
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,440
of that default mode network far more

1592
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,870
and in a far more beneficial way

1593
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,200
if you actively try and suppress your bias

1594
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,780
toward being more
interoceptive or exteroceptive.

1595
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,970
Now, I think that's immensely beneficial,

1596
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,370
both for the immediate
changes that you experience,

1597
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,830
what others have called a state change,

1598
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,330
because that's what it is,

1599
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,870
and it also can lead to,
as we referred to earlier,

1600
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:03,960
more neuroplasticity, more
changes in the brain circuits

1601
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,450
that underlie your default mode network

1602
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,400
and lead to what are called trait changes.

1603
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,130
And I want to be very clear
that I am not the first

1604
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,860
to make this state
versus trait distinction.

1605
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,660
That's a distinction that was raised

1606
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,160
in a really wonderful book.

1607
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,170
In fact, I can't recommend
this book highly enough.

1608
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:22,230
The book is "Altered Traits:
Science Reveals How Meditation

1609
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,990
Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body."

1610
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,020
This is a book by Daniel
Goleman and Richard Davidson

1611
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,240
who've done terrific
work and many writings

1612
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,640
and many TED Talks, et
cetera, about meditation.

1613
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,390
I would say that circa 2016, 2017,

1614
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:38,460
this book really captured

1615
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,250
what I believe to be the
most essential elements

1616
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,480
of the science of meditation

1617
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,640
and a lot of the history of it as well.

1618
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,690
Today, we are focusing

1619
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,250
on much of what's covered in this book

1620
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,083
but also a lot of things

1621
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:50,850
that have happened, excuse me, since 2017.

1622
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,950
In fact, most of the papers
that I'm going to talk about

1623
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:55,503
are papers that were published after 2017.

1624
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:56,940
But, again, this is a wonderful book

1625
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,040
where they very clearly distinguish

1626
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,140
between state changes and trait changes,

1627
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,870
trait changes being the
more long-lasting ones.

1628
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,350
My read of this book and
the literature that follows

1629
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:11,100
is, again, that when you
sit down to meditate,

1630
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,230
it is going to be most effective

1631
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,770
to do that interoceptive,
exteroceptive bias assessment.

1632
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,170
Ask yourself whether or not
you are more in your head

1633
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,300
or outside your head, if you will,

1634
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,310
and then to do a meditation practice

1635
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:27,060
that runs counter to
where you happen to be at,

1636
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,340
that is, that pushes you more externally

1637
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,540
if you're in your head,

1638
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,090
and if you're more focused on
what's going on around you,

1639
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,070
that pushes you more internally.

1640
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,480
Now, I think most people are familiar

1641
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,270
with how to do an
interoceptive-biased meditation.

1642
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,620
Again, that would be setting a timer.

1643
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,940
Maybe you don't have even set a timer,

1644
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,350
you just sit or lie down, close your eyes,

1645
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,170
focus on that third eye
center behind your forehead

1646
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,960
or focus on your breathing
or your bodily sensations.

1647
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,580
That's typical and often discussed.

1648
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,640
Exteroceptive based meditations,

1649
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,880
you pick a focal point outside

1650
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,650
or beyond the confines of your skin,

1651
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,050
so that could be, for
instance, a point on the wall

1652
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,480
if you are indoors, it could be a plant,

1653
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,390
it could be a point on
the horizon far away.

1654
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,270
What you will find is
that your visual system

1655
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:10,320
will fatigue a little bit

1656
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,750
when you concentrate your
visual focus at that location.

1657
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,090
I want to remind you
that it is perfectly okay

1658
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,130
and, in fact, necessary to blink,

1659
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,870
so you should blink,
you can relax your face,

1660
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,010
you can change your expression.

1661
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,650
There is no rule that says
that you can't do those things.

1662
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,710
This is not, you know, just
beaming a particular location

1663
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,630
in space and holding your eyelids open.

1664
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,120
I've been accused many times
of not blinking very often.

1665
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,020
That's for other reasons.

1666
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,180
It's part of the way I access memory

1667
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,200
about what I want to say.

1668
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,490
I don't use a prompter here,

1669
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:40,230
so I'm accessing from a sort
of internal image in my head.

1670
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,400
That's how my memory works.

1671
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,630
But in any case,

1672
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,840
if you're going to do an
exteroceptive-biased meditation,

1673
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,220
there is absolutely no reason

1674
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,410
why you wouldn't look
away from that location

1675
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:50,250
every once in a while

1676
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,450
in the same way

1677
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,400
that if you were focused
on internal thoughts

1678
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,470
with your eyes closed and
focused on your breathing,

1679
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,550
every once in a while,

1680
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:00,570
your thoughts will skip
away from that breathing

1681
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,680
or from your third eye center.

1682
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,190
In fact, and this is discussed
in the book "Altered Traits"

1683
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,590
but by many other people as well,

1684
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:10,140
one of the key elements of
any meditative practice,

1685
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,300
whether or not it's
interoceptively focused

1686
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,250
or exteroceptively focused,

1687
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,640
is that it's really a refocusing practice.

1688
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,270
The more number of times that
you have to yank yourself back

1689
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,120
into attending or perceiving
one specific thing.

1690
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,160
In other words, the more
times your mind wanders

1691
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,540
and you bring it back,

1692
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,880
actually the more
effective that practice is.

1693
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,130
Again, if you can just
focus on one location

1694
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,120
with laser precision

1695
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,860
and your mind never darts away from that

1696
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,760
and you don't have to bring it back,

1697
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,500
well, then there's no neuroplasticity,

1698
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,140
nothing needs to change
because your nervous system

1699
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,330
will effectively know
it's performing perfectly.

1700
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,857
So if you're somebody who
tries to do meditation

1701
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,600
and you find that your mind just wanders,

1702
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,730
just remember every
time you scruff yourself

1703
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:48,660
and pull yourself back

1704
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,880
to focusing on some location externally

1705
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,460
or focus back on your breath
or your third eye center,

1706
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,790
each one of those aren't just
opportunities to do better,

1707
01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:00,300
they are essential to
the improvement process.

1708
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,480
Think about them as ascending
a staircase of refocusing.

1709
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,540
Every time you refocus, you're
going up one more level,

1710
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,970
another stair, another
stair, another stair,

1711
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:11,010
and I think that will move you away

1712
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,960
from the kind of judgmental process

1713
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,910
of thinking, "Ugh, like, I
can't focus on anything."

1714
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,470
Pretty soon, what you'll notice

1715
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:20,550
is that the refocusing
process will happen so quickly

1716
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,170
that you don't even perceive it.

1717
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:23,940
And, again, this is
something that's borne out

1718
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:24,930
in the neuroimaging data.

1719
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,660
A lot of people think that they can focus

1720
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:28,980
with laser precision,

1721
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,630
but actually, what they
are better at doing

1722
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:34,080
is refocusing more quickly
and consistently over time.

1723
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,000
There's a classic study about this

1724
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,340
in very experienced meditators
that was done in Japan

1725
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,960
where they had people

1726
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,450
with varying levels of meditation ability,

1727
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,310
so some who had never meditated,

1728
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,080
others who were really expert meditators

1729
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,330
with many hundreds if
not thousands of hours

1730
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,650
of meditation under their belt,

1731
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,890
and they had those
people listen to 20 tones

1732
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:54,870
repeated over and over, the same tone,

1733
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,910
and they found that the expert meditators

1734
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:00,180
could really focus, and they
did this by brain imaging,

1735
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,460
they could really focus on all 20 tones,

1736
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,290
whereas most people kind of attenuate

1737
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:05,790
or what's called habituate to the tone

1738
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,080
so that by the 10th or 11th tone,

1739
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,540
their mind is really
going to something else.

1740
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,450
Now, that's wonderful, but
that really just tells us

1741
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:14,340
the expert meditators have better focus.

1742
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,030
But it turns out that the more
modern neuroimaging studies

1743
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,620
have shown that they
don't have better focus

1744
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,440
such that they're staying in
a very narrow trench of focus.

1745
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,150
What they're doing is
they're exiting focus

1746
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,310
and going back in more quickly,
more quickly, more quickly

1747
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,510
over and over again.

1748
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,090
So rather than think about
your ability to focus,

1749
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,100
think about your ability to refocus,

1750
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,200
and the more number of
times you have to refocus,

1751
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,760
the better training you're getting.

1752
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,160
So earlier, I mentioned doing
this interoceptive-biased

1753
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,460
or exteroceptive-biased
meditation for three minutes.

1754
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,540
Why did I say three minutes?

1755
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,250
Well, three minutes seems
like a reasonable number

1756
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:48,240
for most people to do
consistently, you know, once a day.

1757
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,760
And in fact, there are some studies

1758
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,917
of one-minute meditations
and three-minute meditations

1759
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:53,700
and 10 and 60.

1760
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,790
My laboratory has been studying
a 5-minute-a-day meditation,

1761
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,710
and that clearly has benefits,

1762
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,940
but I think it's also clear
that by three minutes,

1763
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,160
many of the benefits
are starting to arrive.

1764
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,960
And so while I'm not pointing

1765
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,450
at any one particular data point here,

1766
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,020
it's very clear that forcing oneself

1767
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,250
to direct one's perception,
that is, your attention,

1768
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:20,910
to your internal state or
to something external to you

1769
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:23,250
is immensely beneficial
if you do it consistently

1770
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,590
and is, again, especially beneficial

1771
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:27,689
if you're focusing your attention

1772
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:30,569
on the portion of your experience,

1773
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:32,459
either internal or external to you,

1774
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,810
that is not the one

1775
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,120
that you would default to in that moment.

1776
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,220
And some people have taken
this to the extreme to say

1777
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:40,290
that, you know, you can even
just move about your day,

1778
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,279
and then every once in a while,

1779
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,409
just do a one breath meditation.

1780
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,109
To be honest, when I look
at the whole of the data,

1781
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:49,769
it seems as if it doesn't really matter

1782
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,810
in order to derive most of the benefits

1783
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:53,220
of a meditation practice.

1784
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,310
Now, I'm a big fan of some
of the newer meditation apps

1785
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:57,143
that are out there.

1786
01:08:57,143 --> 01:08:58,557
One in particular that I've been using

1787
01:08:58,557 --> 01:09:00,210
and that actually I started using

1788
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,040
because my dad is a big fan of it

1789
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,229
and he does now fairly long meditations.

1790
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:06,239
He's doing about 10 or 20 minutes

1791
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,220
at least every other
day and often every day,

1792
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,890
and he convinced me to
check out the Waking Up app

1793
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,423
that Sam Harris has put out.

1794
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,040
I looked at it, I think some
of it sits behind a paywall,

1795
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,490
but you can access much of
it or at least do a trial

1796
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,010
and try it out without having
to get behind that paywall.

1797
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,290
They're not a sponsor of this
podcast, I should mention,

1798
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,060
but I decided to use the Waking Up app.

1799
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,140
I think it's terrific,

1800
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,970
and I think one of the
reasons it's terrific

1801
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:32,189
is that Sam includes short descriptions

1802
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:33,776
of what meditation is doing

1803
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:36,600
and what a specific
meditation can do for you

1804
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,729
just prior to doing that meditation.

1805
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:40,409
So those meditations can be quite brief.

1806
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,300
Some of them are a minute
long, two minutes long,

1807
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,149
some are longer or even
quite a bit longer.

1808
01:09:45,149 --> 01:09:48,119
That app, I think, includes
a variety of meditations

1809
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:52,050
that really encompasses the
huge range of possibilities

1810
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,700
that are possible with meditation,

1811
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,240
and that, at least by my
experience of the Waking Up app,

1812
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,840
has led to my most consistent
meditation practice.

1813
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,370
And, of course, I would love to get Sam

1814
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:03,570
on the podcast as a guest

1815
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:06,360
so we could talk about
the sort of underpinnings

1816
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,290
of the Waking Up app

1817
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,540
and his views on
everything from meditation

1818
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,550
to, I know he's big in the discussion

1819
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:12,990
about free will and consciousness,

1820
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,540
some of the very deep and
somewhat abstract discussions.

1821
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,250
I really hope to get Sam on the podcast

1822
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,020
at a time not too far from now.

1823
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,390
Meanwhile, we've never met in person,

1824
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:24,300
but I absolutely love
the Waking Up app, Sam,

1825
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,190
and I know my father does as well,

1826
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,750
and I know many of you already use it.

1827
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,860
If you haven't tried it already,

1828
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,840
I really do encourage you to check it out.

1829
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,010
I want to talk just briefly

1830
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,020
about this third eye center business

1831
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,390
because it turns out to
be pretty interesting.

1832
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:38,310
The third eye is actually a name

1833
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:41,370
that's been given to
another neural structure,

1834
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,770
or I should say structure
because it's not strictly neural,

1835
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,390
and that's the pineal gland,

1836
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,310
and this has an interesting history.

1837
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,620
I promise I'm not taking
off on a tangent here

1838
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,990
that isn't relevant to meditation.

1839
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:54,300
So you have a brain of course,

1840
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,830
and on both sides of your brain,

1841
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:58,650
you tend to have mirror
symmetric representations

1842
01:10:58,650 --> 01:10:59,483
of the same things.

1843
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:00,367
What do I mean by that?

1844
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:01,680
Well, you have a prefrontal
cortex on the right,

1845
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,090
you have a prefrontal cortex on the left,

1846
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,830
and they actually do
slightly different things.

1847
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,020
Language is sometimes
lateralized to one side,

1848
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,870
but in general, for every structure

1849
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,430
that you have on one side of the brain,

1850
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,263
you have the same structure

1851
01:11:12,263 --> 01:11:14,010
on the opposite side of the brain.

1852
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,930
There's one clear exception to that,

1853
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,340
and that's the pineal gland.

1854
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,820
The pineal gland is the
gland that makes melatonin,

1855
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:25,320
which, at night when it gets
dark, secretes melatonin,

1856
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:26,850
and that melatonin makes you sleepy,

1857
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,560
it helps you fall asleep
but not stay asleep.

1858
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,870
Descartes, right, the
philosopher Descartes

1859
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,450
asserted that the pineal
was the seat of the soul

1860
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:36,120
because it was the one
structure in the brain

1861
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,210
that he saw was not on
both sides of the brain,

1862
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:41,820
it was only one of them and in the middle.

1863
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,980
Now, I don't know if it's
the seat of the soul or not,

1864
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,880
I'm not in a position to
make assessments like that.

1865
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,590
But what do we know about the pineal?

1866
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,790
The pineal, as I mentioned,

1867
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,380
is involved in releasing melatonin,

1868
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,360
it does a few other things as well,

1869
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,830
but it is also considered the third eye

1870
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,000
for a couple of reasons.

1871
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,120
One is that it responds to light,

1872
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,950
although, in humans, not directly.

1873
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,660
So in birds and lizards and snakes,

1874
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,280
they actually either have a thin skull,

1875
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,650
or, believe it or not, two
holes in the top of their skull

1876
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,630
that allow light to go directly in.

1877
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:14,580
If you look at the head of a snake,

1878
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,300
light can go directly into
their brain through these holes

1879
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,510
and activate the pineal
to suppress melatonin

1880
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:24,960
and control their
wakefulness, sleep rhythms.

1881
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,820
In birds, they don't have
holes in their skull,

1882
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,260
but they have very thin skulls.

1883
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,100
And, believe it or not,

1884
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:33,750
light can penetrate the thinness
of the skull in many birds

1885
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,840
and communicates information
about time of day

1886
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,040
and even time of year,

1887
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,230
and that's translating to hormonal signals

1888
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,420
such as melatonin release from the pineal.

1889
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,030
And so the pineal has
been called the third eye

1890
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,300
because it's a light-sensitive
organ inside the brain.

1891
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,220
In humans, the pineal sits
deep, deep, deep to the surface,

1892
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,570
and light cannot get in there.

1893
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,270
In fact, if light can get into your brain,

1894
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:59,460
unless you are part of
a specific experiment

1895
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,260
where that's the intention

1896
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,660
or you're having neurosurgery
or something of that sort,

1897
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,480
then you've got serious issues happening.

1898
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,640
That pineal sits deep, deep, deep

1899
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,860
near what's called the fourth ventricle,

1900
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:14,820
and it absolutely should
not see light directly.

1901
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,070
So the idea that the pineal

1902
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:19,800
is the third eye in humans is not true.

1903
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,633
It just isn't true.

1904
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:23,310
So anytime someone says, "Oh,
the pineal is your third eye."

1905
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,370
That's not the third eye center
that people are referring to

1906
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,440
when they talk about meditation.

1907
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,580
Now, you'll see a number
of different forms of art

1908
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,730
where it will be a picture of a face

1909
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,350
and the eyes will be
closed or sometimes open,

1910
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,610
and there'll be literally a third eye,

1911
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:41,580
like a cyclops eye in the
middle of the forehead.

1912
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,850
That has been proposed for
many thousands of years

1913
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,000
to be, quote, unquote, the
seat of our consciousness.

1914
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,080
Now, that's interesting

1915
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,350
because that real estate
behind the forehead

1916
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:54,180
actually turns out to be
the prefrontal cortex,

1917
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,240
which we know from lesion
studies and stimulation studies,

1918
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,960
if you remove that brain area,
people become very reflexive.

1919
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,540
They are not thinking intentionally,

1920
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,710
they don't become deliberate.

1921
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,710
In fact, and this is
kind of an eerie result,

1922
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:12,710
but if you inactivate, you
turn off the prefrontal cortex

1923
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,420
and you give somebody the opportunity

1924
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,970
to play a shooting game, for instance,

1925
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,550
their accuracy goes through the roof.

1926
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:21,960
They become essentially like a machine.

1927
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,220
They see a stimulus, they shoot at it,

1928
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,810
they see a stimulus, they shoot at it.

1929
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,670
Their accuracy is exceptional,

1930
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:29,640
but their ability to distinguish

1931
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,140
between enemy and friend
completely disappears.

1932
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:37,230
So they become a highly effective motor,

1933
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:40,200
or I should say sensory motor machine,

1934
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,720
but their assessment and their judgment

1935
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,060
about right or wrong
completely disappears.

1936
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,760
This is also true for people
that have prefrontal damage.

1937
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,920
They often will have
inappropriate behavior

1938
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,440
or a hard time suppressing
behaviors, et cetera.

1939
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,510
So the third eye center

1940
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:57,540
as the seat of consciousness
and our intention

1941
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:00,270
is something that makes sense generally

1942
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,760
with what we know about the
neuroscience and neurology,

1943
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,050
but there's something more to it

1944
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,210
that I think is especially
important for all of you

1945
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,610
that goes beyond anything
about ancient traditions

1946
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,200
or pineals or birds or snakes

1947
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,950
and pits in the top of the
head, and here's what it is.

1948
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:17,460
The brain itself,
meaning the brain tissue,

1949
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:21,450
does not have any sensory neurons.

1950
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,320
What do I mean by that?

1951
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,590
Well, if I touch the top of
my hand, I can feel that.

1952
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:28,500
If I want to sense my heartbeat,

1953
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,020
if I work at it, I can feel that.

1954
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,960
If I want to sense how I feel internally

1955
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,280
at the level of my stomach,

1956
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,710
is it full, is it empty,
am I hungry, is it acidic,

1957
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:40,020
does it ache or does it
feel pleasant, et cetera,

1958
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,730
I can sense that.

1959
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:43,620
And that's because we have sensory neurons

1960
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,300
on our skin and in our body, et cetera.

1961
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,710
We also have sensory neurons in our eyes

1962
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:48,600
that let us perceive things externally.

1963
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,240
We have no sensory neurons on our brain.

1964
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:54,090
This is one of the reasons
why you can remove the skull

1965
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,520
and do brain surgery on
somebody who's wide awake

1966
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,540
and be poking around in there,

1967
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:00,240
and they don't need any
anesthetic on the brain itself.

1968
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,970
They need anesthetic
for the incision site,

1969
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,440
but they don't need
anesthetic on the brain

1970
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,780
because it has no feeling.

1971
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,390
You have emotions, but there's no feeling.

1972
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:13,230
So normally, we are perceiving
and paying attention

1973
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:14,460
to what we are sensing,

1974
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,190
either externally, sight and
sounds, again, exteroception,

1975
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:20,730
or internally, interoception,
touch, et cetera.

1976
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:24,090
But by focusing our
perception and our attention

1977
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:27,330
not on our bodily
surface like a body scan,

1978
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:30,360
but to a point a couple
centimeters or inches

1979
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,400
behind our forehead,

1980
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,740
we essentially are
bringing that attentional,

1981
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,180
that perceptual spotlight

1982
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:40,200
to a location in which
there is no sensation.

1983
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,210
There's nothing to feel there.

1984
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:44,070
And when we do that, by closing our eyes

1985
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:46,590
and focusing on that, quote,
unquote, third eye center,

1986
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:49,383
which is the prefrontal
cortex, to be quite honest,

1987
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,240
when we do that, something else happens.

1988
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,510
And what happens is when
we are not thinking about

1989
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,813
and perceiving our sensations,
because there are none there,

1990
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,860
our thoughts and our
emotions and our memories

1991
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,510
sort of mushroom up.

1992
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:09,420
A better way to put it
would be that they geyser up

1993
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,870
and take on more prominence
in our perception.

1994
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:15,150
What I mean by this is that normally,

1995
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:18,090
you know, I'm not thinking
about the contact point

1996
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,800
between me and this chair,

1997
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,770
but as I'm speaking, I'm
in contact with the chair

1998
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,510
and those neurons are firing.

1999
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,540
But if I focus my energy
and attention on them,

2000
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:28,770
they're going to fire the same

2001
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,450
but more of my perception goes there.

2002
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:33,390
Similarly, I'm thinking things
all the time. You are too.

2003
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,040
And I'm perceiving things all the time,

2004
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,237
and I'm remembering things all the time,

2005
01:17:36,237 --> 01:17:39,270
and I'm anticipating things
all the time about the future.

2006
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:42,810
But by focusing my
attention on the one organ

2007
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:45,780
for which I have no sensation,

2008
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,550
that is, my brain,

2009
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:52,140
well, then thoughts,
feelings, and memories,

2010
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,780
feelings meaning emotional feelings,

2011
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:58,110
start to grow in their prominence

2012
01:17:58,110 --> 01:18:00,420
in my awareness and in my perception.

2013
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,680
And so this is why

2014
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,630
when you sit down to
a meditative practice,

2015
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,670
if it's a meditative practice
where you close your eyes

2016
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:07,710
or you're focused on
that third eye center,

2017
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,460
where you're focused on your brain

2018
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,000
as opposed to your bodily surface

2019
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,950
or something external to you,

2020
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:16,920
the thoughts seem to come by in waves,

2021
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,300
and they can almost be overwhelming.

2022
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,420
It's very hard to, as
it's often described,

2023
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,190
just sit back and watch
your thoughts go by

2024
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,870
because there are so many of them.

2025
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,430
Actually, the best way to stop thinking

2026
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:29,700
is to really focus on something external

2027
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,890
or to focus on sensation.

2028
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:36,030
That's less thinking than it
is perceiving senses, okay?

2029
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:38,400
So I don't want this to get too abstract.

2030
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,900
When people talk about
the third eye center,

2031
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:41,130
they're not talking about the pineal,

2032
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,450
they're talking about prefrontal cortex,

2033
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,370
and when you direct your own attention

2034
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:47,340
to the very area of your
brain that directs attention,

2035
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,500
there's nothing to sense there.

2036
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,260
The only things that will
become present to you

2037
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,310
are feelings, emotions, that is,

2038
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:59,040
thoughts and memories,

2039
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,390
and they will often arrive

2040
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:02,790
in what seems to be a
very disorganized fashion.

2041
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:06,810
And the reason they arrive in
somewhat disorganized fashion

2042
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,520
is because, normally,

2043
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,590
we just don't perceive things that way.

2044
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:12,870
Normally, we are splitting our attention,

2045
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,280
our perception, that is,

2046
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,460
to multiple things, our
sensation and our thoughts.

2047
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,130
When we put all of our
perception into our thoughts,

2048
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,370
we see how disorganized,
how wandering they are

2049
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:27,540
and how, in fact, how random
and intrusive those can be.

2050
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,400
Again, random and intrusive.

2051
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,040
And much of what we talked
about in that paper earlier,

2052
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,420
the one where they asked people,

2053
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,620
what are you doing and
what are you feeling

2054
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,660
and how happy or how unhappy you are,

2055
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:40,350
what they discovered was that most people

2056
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,150
are sort of in their head a lot.

2057
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,520
They're not really present
to what they're doing,

2058
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,950
which leads me to the
statement that I believe,

2059
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:49,410
at least based on the
data, that paper included,

2060
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:53,730
that most people have
an interoceptive bias.

2061
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:56,010
They're focused more on
what's going on internally

2062
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,590
than they are focused on
what's happening externally.

2063
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:02,160
There are certainly people
who for the opposite is true,

2064
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,770
but I think that this is an issue

2065
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:07,770
because we hear so often about the need

2066
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,610
to do a meditation practice
that allows us to focus inward

2067
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:12,900
and that we're getting yanked around

2068
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,090
by all the stressors of
life, et cetera, et cetera.

2069
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,560
And we are, we're getting yanked around

2070
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,690
by all the stressors and demands of life.

2071
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,340
But as we do that,

2072
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:22,950
we tend to be very focused
on what's happening with us.

2073
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,900
The data clearly point to the fact

2074
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,180
that being mindful and being aware

2075
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:31,050
can enhance one's level
of presence and happiness.

2076
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:32,910
But we can go so far as to say

2077
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,070
that being mindful and
aware of what's happening,

2078
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,240
not just with us

2079
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,460
but external to us in our
immediate environment,

2080
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,800
that includes what other
people are saying and doing,

2081
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,500
that also can really enhance our sense

2082
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,790
of well-being and happiness.

2083
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,500
At least that's what the data point to.

2084
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,290
Let's briefly recap
where we've been so far.

2085
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:51,780
We've talked a little bit
about the brain networks

2086
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,700
that are activated during meditation,

2087
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:57,300
which include prefrontal
cortex, ACC, the insula.

2088
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,470
We also talked about the difference

2089
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:01,050
between interoception and exteroception

2090
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:04,320
and the importance of
assessing where you are

2091
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,790
along that continuum.

2092
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,990
And I should mention, of course,

2093
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:09,660
that you can be right in the
middle of that continuum.

2094
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:11,190
You might sit down to do meditation

2095
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:13,470
and find that you are
smack dab in the middle

2096
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:16,080
of being able to attend
to things outside of you

2097
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,940
but also attending to
things inside of you.

2098
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,910
In which case, I suggest
doing a meditation

2099
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:24,450
that is either exteroceptive-biased
or interoceptive-biased.

2100
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,280
But as I mentioned earlier,

2101
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,980
if you find that you are more,
quote, unquote, in your head

2102
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,880
or in your body,

2103
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,570
well, then focus on an
exteroceptive-biased meditation

2104
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,970
to build up that set of circuits.

2105
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:38,640
Whereas if you are more
exteroceptively focused

2106
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,810
at any given moment,

2107
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:40,740
well, then I encourage you

2108
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,920
to do an interoceptively
focused meditation practice.

2109
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,540
And as I mentioned earlier,

2110
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,150
there is this issue of
how long to do a practice.

2111
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:49,680
There are a lot of
different data on these,

2112
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,810
but some of the practices

2113
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,220
we've covered on this podcast before

2114
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,840
when we had guests, for instance,

2115
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,210
highlighted the 13-minute meditation

2116
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:00,510
that Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New
York University's laboratory

2117
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:01,740
has popularized,

2118
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:04,110
and they popularized it because
they have a wonderful paper

2119
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,820
that we will provide a link to

2120
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,240
which shows that a daily
13-minute meditation,

2121
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,550
which is of the traditional third eye,

2122
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,680
interoceptively biased,
focus on breathing,

2123
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,090
and focus on that location

2124
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,100
directly behind one's forehead or both,

2125
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:20,010
that meditation done daily
for about eight weeks,

2126
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,740
maybe shorter, but in
that study, eight weeks,

2127
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:25,560
greatly improved mood,
improved ability to sleep,

2128
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,200
improved cognitive
ability and focus, memory,

2129
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,770
a huge number of metrics were
looked at very specifically.

2130
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,603
So that's a terrific one.

2131
01:22:32,603 --> 01:22:33,840
And you may be asking yourself,

2132
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,460
do you need to do the full 13 minutes?

2133
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,380
Could you get away with five
minutes or three minutes?

2134
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,350
Well, my laboratory has shown
benefits in stress reduction,

2135
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,090
improvement in sleep, et cetera,

2136
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,120
with a five-minute-a-day meditation.

2137
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,530
However, in trying to establish

2138
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,120
how long you should meditate,

2139
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,770
I would ask yourself
a couple of questions.

2140
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,480
First of all, what is a practice

2141
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,130
that you can do consistently?

2142
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,000
And by consistently,

2143
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,760
that doesn't necessarily mean every day.

2144
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,420
If you answer the question
about consistency honestly,

2145
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,040
and you find that you can only do

2146
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,050
one meditation session per week,

2147
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,060
well, then I would encourage
you to go a little bit longer,

2148
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,520
maybe 10 or 15 minutes,
maybe even 30 minutes.

2149
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,830
Again, understanding that
you're going to have to refocus

2150
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:12,840
repeatedly throughout that meditation

2151
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,250
regardless of whether
or not you're focusing

2152
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:17,190
on internal perceptions
or external perceptions.

2153
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:21,960
If, however, you can set aside
5 or 10 or 15 minutes per day

2154
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,610
and you can meditate every day,

2155
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:26,340
well, then I think you
have a bit more flexibility

2156
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:27,600
in terms of how long you meditate.

2157
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,300
Maybe it's three minutes one
day, one minute the next day,

2158
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,490
10 minutes the next,
and so on and so forth.

2159
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:35,970
Just like with exercise, the
key component is consistency,

2160
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:37,590
and this is borne out in all the data

2161
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:39,570
that's covered in "Altered Traits."

2162
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:42,090
It's also borne out in
all the recent studies

2163
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:44,280
that have come out since
that book was published.

2164
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,540
Consistency is key,

2165
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,910
so ask yourself what
you can do consistently,

2166
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:50,790
and also don't necessarily burden yourself

2167
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:53,040
with always having to do the same amount

2168
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,600
or duration of meditation.

2169
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,150
So earlier, we decided
we were going to parse

2170
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,640
or fine slice the meditation practice,

2171
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,020
and indeed we've been doing that.

2172
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:04,740
We've talked about interoceptive
versus exteroceptive bias,

2173
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,240
and we've been talking about

2174
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,270
where you place your
perception or your focus.

2175
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:11,910
Another key component of meditation

2176
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:14,370
is the pattern of
breathing that you embrace.

2177
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:16,380
In fact, the pattern of breathing

2178
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,780
that you embrace during
your meditation practice

2179
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:22,560
can itself be its own form of meditation.

2180
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,640
What do I mean by that?

2181
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,400
Well, these days, we hear
a lot about breathwork.

2182
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,500
Breathwork has really grown in popularity

2183
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,030
in the last 5, 10 years,

2184
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,560
and there are a number
of reasons for that.

2185
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,530
First of all, I think we
need to credit Wim Hof,

2186
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:36,270
or can we call him, I think appropriately,

2187
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,530
the Great Wim Hof?

2188
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,390
You know, certainly there
were people before Wim

2189
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:40,770
who were doing deliberate breathwork

2190
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,600
and talking about deliberate breathwork,

2191
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,200
but it was really about 2015 or so

2192
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:50,400
that Wim Hof started to grow
in recognition and popularity

2193
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,260
for a particular style of breathing,

2194
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:55,380
which, in the laboratory, we
call cyclic hyperventilation.

2195
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,850
I know there are other names for it

2196
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,380
that come from ancient traditions.

2197
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:02,580
He named it, or people
named it after him, Wim Hof.

2198
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,680
Wim Hof, for those of you that don't know,

2199
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:09,450
is a Dutchman who is known
to hold many world records

2200
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:11,310
for deliberate cold exposure,

2201
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:14,820
including swimming under
icebergs, longest period of time

2202
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,070
buried in ice up to his neck, et cetera,

2203
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,390
but who's also expert

2204
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:20,490
in the use of breathing in particular ways

2205
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:23,760
in order to manage and maneuver
through those challenges.

2206
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,200
And he started speaking about

2207
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,250
different patterns of breathwork,

2208
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:29,940
in particular, the use of
cyclic hyperventilation,

2209
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:31,620
deep, deliberate breathing,

2210
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:34,560
so big inhales [inhales],
exhales [exhales],

2211
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,040
big inhales [inhales and exhales] exhales.

2212
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,040
In the laboratory, again,

2213
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,570
we call that cyclic hyperventilation.

2214
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:43,320
It's very clear from studies
both done on Wim specifically

2215
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,000
but on the general population as well

2216
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,530
by my lab and other labs

2217
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:48,660
that that pattern of
cyclic hyperventilation,

2218
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,510
of deliberately breathing
deeply and repetitively,

2219
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:54,060
typically in through the
nose, out through the mouth,

2220
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,470
generates a lot of adrenaline

2221
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:58,530
or causes adrenaline release
from the brain and body.

2222
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:01,260
It, quote, unquote, heats up the body.

2223
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,060
Indeed, it raises body temperature,

2224
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,610
but the liberation of adrenaline
does a number of things

2225
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:08,580
to shift the state of the brain and body.

2226
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,950
That, more or less, is
what Wim Hof breathing is,

2227
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:12,300
although Wim Hof breathing,

2228
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,280
or some people will
call it tummo breathing

2229
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,170
or cyclic hyperventilation,

2230
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:17,850
is not a pattern of breathing

2231
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:21,390
typical of most meditations
that have been discussed,

2232
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:23,340
at least not in the research literature.

2233
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,680
Now, that's not to say that
cyclic hyperventilation

2234
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,230
can't be incorporated into
a meditation practice,

2235
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:32,130
but Wim Hof breathing aka
cyclic hyperventilation/tummo

2236
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:35,610
is typically considered
its own practice, okay?

2237
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:38,880
Its own breathwork practice
divorced from meditation.

2238
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,380
It might have a meditative component,

2239
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,940
but it's not often discussed as meditation

2240
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:44,610
or as part of meditation.

2241
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:47,070
More typically, a meditation practice

2242
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:49,470
involves slowing one's breathing,

2243
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:52,560
and this could be in the
form of cyclic breathing

2244
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,160
of inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, which is cyclic,

2245
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,670
or, in some cases, doubling up
on inhales and then exhaling,

2246
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:02,370
so inhale, inhale, exhale,
inhale, inhale, exhale,

2247
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:06,210
or controlling the duration
of inhale, breath hold,

2248
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:08,070
exhale, breath hold, repeat,

2249
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:09,510
so-called box breathing

2250
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:12,000
where the inhale, the hold,
the exhale, and the hold

2251
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,550
are of equivalent durations.

2252
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:16,710
Any number of different
breathing patterns,

2253
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:20,250
slow cyclic breathing, box breathing,

2254
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:23,280
a cadence of three to six seconds in,

2255
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,770
holding for two seconds,
and seven seconds out,

2256
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:29,340
regardless of what cadence
of breathing one uses,

2257
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,880
there is a tendency during
most meditative practices

2258
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,690
to slow one's breathing
and/or control one's breathing

2259
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:38,490
in deliberate fashion.

2260
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,300
This is essential because
when we default our breathing,

2261
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,880
that is, when we don't pay attention

2262
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,840
to how long we are inhaling
relative to our exhales,

2263
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,120
when we don't deliberately exhale,

2264
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,360
that is, normally we just passively exhale

2265
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,650
but we actively inhale,

2266
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:56,483
I repeat that,

2267
01:27:56,483 --> 01:27:58,770
normally, when we're not
thinking about breathing,

2268
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,690
we deliberately inhale,

2269
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:03,690
there's a a motor command that's
sent to inflate the lungs,

2270
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:05,190
and then we passively exhale.

2271
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:08,400
But in many breathwork practices
or meditation practices,

2272
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,850
we actually actively exhale as well.

2273
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:14,040
Well, when we do that, a
number of things happen.

2274
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:18,330
First of all, it forces us
into interoception. Why?

2275
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:19,350
Because the diaphragm,

2276
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:23,070
the muscle that helps
move the lungs essentially

2277
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:27,090
and create a specific cadence of breathing

2278
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:28,890
or depth of breathing

2279
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:30,470
as one would with box breathing

2280
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:32,490
or deliberately slow breathing,

2281
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:34,890
well, that muscle resides inside of us,

2282
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:37,620
and so when we focus on our breathing,

2283
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,510
more often than not, we aren't focused

2284
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:42,480
on the actual air leaving
our nasal passages or mouth,

2285
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,410
maybe a little bit,

2286
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:46,020
but more typically, we are forced to focus

2287
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,610
or we just default to focusing

2288
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:50,310
on the movement of our
diaphragm or of our belly

2289
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:52,260
or the rising and falling of our chest.

2290
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,870
All of that is to say

2291
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:57,630
that by deliberately
focusing on our breathing,

2292
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:01,050
we shift to interoception.

2293
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,957
So breathing and specific
patterns of breathing

2294
01:29:03,957 --> 01:29:07,173
are sort of along for
the ride in meditation,

2295
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,140
but the reverse can also be said,

2296
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:12,030
that when we focus on our breathing,

2297
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:15,960
we shift to interoception and
away from external events.

2298
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,790
It doesn't mean we can't
still pay attention

2299
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,550
to external events, we
can still exterocept,

2300
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:22,830
but at least some portion
of our perception,

2301
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:26,550
of our attention shifts to interoception.

2302
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,180
So we of course need to
breathe to stay alive.

2303
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,490
We have to breathe at least every so often

2304
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:33,480
in order to stay alive,

2305
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,720
so, of course, breathing is
part of any meditative practice,

2306
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,890
just like it's part of any
living activity, even sleep.

2307
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:44,130
But if the first component of meditation

2308
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:47,850
is to direct our perception
in a deliberate way,

2309
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:49,200
using that prefrontal cortex,

2310
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,200
to a specific location,
either on the surface of

2311
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,653
or within our body or
external to our body,

2312
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:58,740
or both, but typically one or the other,

2313
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,410
then we can say that the second element

2314
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:04,890
of a meditative practice is
the pattern of breathing,

2315
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:07,110
and we can ask ourselves,

2316
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,130
can it and should it be deliberate or not?

2317
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:11,640
In other words, do we just default

2318
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,320
to however we happen to be breathing,

2319
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,400
or should it be deliberate?

2320
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,330
That is, should we be controlling
the depth and the cadence?

2321
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,980
And I do believe that,

2322
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,020
based on what we know about the capacity

2323
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,010
for specific patterns of breathing
to shift our brain state,

2324
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,530
that controlling one's
pattern of breathing

2325
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:31,020
during meditation can
be enormously useful,

2326
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:33,330
and that is true regardless
of whether or not

2327
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:38,330
one is focusing on interoceptive
perceptions within our body

2328
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:41,730
or exteroceptive perceptions.

2329
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,780
So that raises the question,

2330
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:44,820
how should we breathe during meditation?

2331
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,040
Well, there is, again,

2332
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,950
no simple one-size-fits-all rule there,

2333
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:53,640
but there are some general
rules of respiration physiology

2334
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:57,240
that can help us access and
develop a meditation practice

2335
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,640
that is going to best serve our goals.

2336
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:03,060
And since this is not an
episode all about respiration,

2337
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,950
and we will do one,

2338
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:06,900
I simply want to give you the basics

2339
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,400
of what respiration can do

2340
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,550
to shift your brain and body state.

2341
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,960
Before I do that, however,

2342
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,050
I want to give a very
specific instruction,

2343
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:18,240
which is when you sit down to meditate,

2344
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,610
or if you're going to do
your meditation walking,

2345
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:21,443
that's fine too.

2346
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:23,610
I should just say when
you are about to begin

2347
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:25,320
your meditative practice,

2348
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,120
you need to ask yourself a question.

2349
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:33,360
Do you want to be more relaxed
than you are at present,

2350
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,510
or do you want to be more
alert than you are at present

2351
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:39,060
when you exit the meditation practice?

2352
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,530
Do you want to calm down,

2353
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:42,270
or do you want to become more alert?

2354
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:46,500
Simple question. You can
decide from session to session.

2355
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,330
You could even switch within a session.

2356
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:50,220
But just as you need to
assess whether or not

2357
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:54,660
you are leaning more
interoceptively or exteroceptively,

2358
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:56,520
you also need to ask yourself,

2359
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,470
do you need to calm down
or want to calm down,

2360
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:59,880
or do you want to be more alert

2361
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,710
at the end of your meditation session?

2362
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:03,990
Or maybe you want to go into
a state of deep relaxation

2363
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:06,690
and then exit with more alertness.

2364
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,640
The way to do that is very simple

2365
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:12,120
using breathwork and specific
patterns of breathing.

2366
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,090
And here is the general
rule that is supported

2367
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:18,780
by all the respiration
physiology that I'm aware of.

2368
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:19,980
I'm oversimplifying here,

2369
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:22,230
but I'm oversimplifying intentionally

2370
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:23,880
so you can simply apply the tool.

2371
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,370
And then, as I mentioned
before, we will do an episode

2372
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,863
all about respiration
physiology in the future.

2373
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:34,770
Essentially, if your inhales

2374
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:38,580
are longer and/or more
vigorous than your exhales,

2375
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:41,760
then you will tend to be more alert

2376
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,080
or you'll shift your brain and body

2377
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,550
towards a state of more alertness.

2378
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:47,910
This is simply based on the
way that the neural circuits

2379
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:50,250
like the pre-Botzinger nucleus
and the parafacial nucleus

2380
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:53,160
that govern respiration
physiology and alertness,

2381
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,240
it's simply the way they work.

2382
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,470
They communicate with brain areas

2383
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:58,353
that release noradrenaline
and norepinephrine, et cetera.

2384
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:05,150
In contrast, if you
emphasize longer duration

2385
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:10,250
and/or more vigorous exhales
relative to your inhales,

2386
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,480
you will tend to relax more,

2387
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,880
you will tend to calm your nervous system.

2388
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,860
Now, you might be saying,
"Okay, I understand what it is

2389
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:19,470
to make an inhale longer than my exhale,

2390
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,120
but how do I make it more vigorous?"

2391
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,610
Well, it simply means drawing
more air into your lungs

2392
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:28,590
more quickly than you allow
yourself to exhale that air.

2393
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:31,770
So an example of inhale-biased breathwork

2394
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:32,987
would be [inhales and exhales]
[inhales and exhales],

2395
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,850
so there's an active
emphasis on the inhale,

2396
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:40,710
and it's a little bit
longer than the exhale

2397
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:41,793
which is passive.

2398
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,480
Conversely, if you want to relax,

2399
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,280
then you want to extend your exhales

2400
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,270
relative to your inhales,

2401
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:50,550
and you can even make them active exhales.

2402
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,577
So it can be inhale [inhales and exhales],

2403
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,547
exhale [inhales and exhales].

2404
01:33:57,810 --> 01:33:59,730
That's going to shift your nervous system

2405
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:02,700
in a direction of more calm.

2406
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,980
And, of course, if you would like to stay

2407
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:08,310
at the level of alertness aka calmness

2408
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:09,330
because those are two sides

2409
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:11,910
of the same seesaw or the same continuum,

2410
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,890
if you'd like to be right where you're at

2411
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:16,380
at the end of your meditation
as where you started,

2412
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,930
at least in terms of levels
of alertness and calmness,

2413
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:22,020
well, then you would just keep
your inhales and your exhales

2414
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:24,780
relatively balanced in terms of duration.

2415
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,730
Now, the introduction of
things like breath holds

2416
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:29,370
with box breathing or Wim Hof breathing,

2417
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:33,120
typically, it's 25 or
30 deep inhale, exhales,

2418
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,790
deep inhale, exhales, and
then exhale all your air,

2419
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:37,800
hold your breath for 15 to 60 seconds,

2420
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:41,280
and then repeat and so on,
sometimes some inhales and holds.

2421
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,590
Well, that's a whole business into itself.

2422
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:47,250
But for sake of meditation,
the key thing to understand

2423
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,780
is that if you are going to do

2424
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:51,720
a complicated breathing practice,

2425
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,660
it will, by design, by necessity,

2426
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:57,900
shift much of your attention
to the breathing practice,

2427
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,160
especially if it's not cyclic,

2428
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,050
if it's not inhales follow exhales.

2429
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:03,420
Cyclic breathing is where
inhales always follow exhales,

2430
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,650
follow inhales, follow exhales.

2431
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:06,960
It actually relies on
a specific brain center

2432
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,310
called the pre-Botzinger complex

2433
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,080
discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.

2434
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,213
He was a guest on this podcast previously.

2435
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,720
However, if you are
doubling up on your inhale,

2436
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,520
so two inhales [inhaling],
and then an exhale [exhales],

2437
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,513
a pattern of breathing

2438
01:35:20,513 --> 01:35:22,980
my laboratory has studied extensively,

2439
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:25,080
well, then that relies on
a different brain center,

2440
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,160
the parafacial nucleus.

2441
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:30,810
The point is that if you are
engaging in noncyclic breathing

2442
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:35,340
or you are deliberately
emphasizing inhales or exhales

2443
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:38,340
or the vigor of inhales
and exhales, et cetera,

2444
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:41,640
well, then some portion of
your attention will be devoted

2445
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,010
to making sure that you follow
that breathing practice.

2446
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:47,460
We are very good at going into
cyclic breathing practices

2447
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:50,550
by default, and our attention
can drift to other things.

2448
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:53,850
Interoceptive or exteroceptive,
it doesn't matter,

2449
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:56,490
we can just drift into, you
know, how our body feels

2450
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:59,370
or something we see or hear
in the room, et cetera.

2451
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:00,840
When we are focused on our breathing

2452
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,740
and the breathing pattern

2453
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:05,310
is noncyclic or complex in some way

2454
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:09,330
in that it involves
deliberate voluntary commands,

2455
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:12,270
again, from those so-called
top-down mechanisms

2456
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,680
of the prefrontal cortex,

2457
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,600
well, that, by design,
requires some portion,

2458
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,700
often a significant
portion of our attention

2459
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:23,580
to be devoted to the
breathing practice itself.

2460
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,413
So what does this mean?

2461
01:36:24,413 --> 01:36:26,490
This means that breathwork itself

2462
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,260
can be a form of meditation,

2463
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:31,860
and meditation can involve breathwork,

2464
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:36,813
but one should know that the
more deliberate and unnatural

2465
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,170
that pattern of breathing is,

2466
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:43,260
the less you will be able
to focus on other things.

2467
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:44,940
Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

2468
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,080
You can actually leverage this.

2469
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,640
So for instance, if you are somebody

2470
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,980
who's very much caught in your own head,

2471
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:51,870
right, we talked about this earlier,

2472
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:53,577
or you're in a moment where
you're really stuck in your head

2473
01:36:53,577 --> 01:36:55,320
and you want to get out of your head,

2474
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,030
well, then that meditation
practice that you do

2475
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:59,370
really should be focused
on exteroceptive bias,

2476
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:01,350
you should really focus on
something external to you,

2477
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,310
and I would encourage you

2478
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:05,490
to use a natural cyclic
pattern of breathing

2479
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:08,850
where inhales follow exhales
follow inhales follow exhales.

2480
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:10,470
If, however, you are finding

2481
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:12,780
that you're sort of
caught in the landscape

2482
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:14,340
of things happening around you

2483
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,070
and you want to ground yourself,
as it's sometimes called...

2484
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:19,350
That's a loose language,
not a scientific language.

2485
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,970
I know there's this practice of grounding,

2486
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:21,803
and that's a whole thing.

2487
01:37:21,803 --> 01:37:22,636
People are always writing to me,

2488
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:25,350
"Is grounding a real thing,
walking barefoot on the Earth

2489
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:28,140
and magnetic fields, you know,
and gravitational fields?"

2490
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:29,490
Well, gravity's real,

2491
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:30,780
but, you know, grounding,

2492
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:33,450
there isn't a lot of
science for it, to be frank.

2493
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,760
It does feel nice to walk
on the ground, however.

2494
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,090
But if you are somebody
who's kind of feeling

2495
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:41,460
pulled out of yourself
a lot or in a moment

2496
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,880
and you want to bring your
awareness into your body

2497
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,440
and sort of calm down,

2498
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,240
well, then I would encourage you

2499
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:52,350
to, yes, use a deliberate,
somewhat unnatural

2500
01:37:52,350 --> 01:37:55,590
or non-default pattern of breathing,

2501
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:57,870
which, by definition, will force you

2502
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:01,890
to attend to what's
going on interoceptively.

2503
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:03,270
Again, I'm not aware of any place

2504
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:06,000
that this has been discussed
in detail such as this before.

2505
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,610
If there is a research literature on this,

2506
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:09,443
please let me know.

2507
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:11,190
My laboratory has been
working on this extensively.

2508
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:14,490
I'm always looking for new
colleagues and collaborators.

2509
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:17,490
We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel
who's an expert in hypnosis,

2510
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:21,180
again, who's been a guest
on the Huberman Lab podcast

2511
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,860
and my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry.

2512
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:24,720
In fact, he's our associate
chair of psychiatry,

2513
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,180
world expert in hypnosis, he's
been on this podcast before,

2514
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,840
we have an active research
program focused on these issues.

2515
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,190
We are very much of the belief

2516
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:35,430
that a breathwork practice
itself can be meditative,

2517
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:38,460
a meditation practice
can include breathing,

2518
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,770
but the more that that meditative practice

2519
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:42,630
focuses on the breathing itself,

2520
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:45,240
the more interoceptive-biased it will be.

2521
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,970
Now, it's very important to understand

2522
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:51,150
that an interoceptive-biased
breathwork practice

2523
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:53,160
will have a specific effect,

2524
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,100
which is to make you more
interoceptively aware.

2525
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,560
And if you think back to
earlier in the episode,

2526
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,780
for many people, that
will be a wonderful thing

2527
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:03,360
and something that they
are actively seeking

2528
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,890
or ought to seek

2529
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:06,990
because it can help people gain awareness,

2530
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:09,270
for instance, you know,
if they're stressed

2531
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:11,010
and they're not realizing
it till the end of the day,

2532
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:12,270
they're just exhausted,

2533
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,130
more interoceptive
awareness throughout the day

2534
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:16,080
can be very beneficial.

2535
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,910
If, however, you are somebody

2536
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:20,760
who is overly focused on
your bodily sensations,

2537
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,520
well, then more exteroception
awareness is important.

2538
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,250
And this brings us to a yet larger theme

2539
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:29,160
but a theme that I think really emphasizes

2540
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,350
what particular types
of meditative practices

2541
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,660
are going to be best for certain people,

2542
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:36,030
especially people who are using meditation

2543
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:37,800
to combat certain challenges,

2544
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,540
in particular, mood-based challenges

2545
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:43,200
or sleep-based challenges
or focus-based challenges.

2546
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,190
I haven't listed off

2547
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:49,190
all the positive benefits of
meditation yet in this episode,

2548
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,870
but they are many, many, many.

2549
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:54,210
In fact, there are now tens of thousands

2550
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:56,910
of scientific studies
showing, for instance,

2551
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:59,880
there are known benefits
of doing meditation

2552
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,350
for enhancing sleep,

2553
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:03,660
there are known benefits of
a regular meditation practice

2554
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,980
for enhancing focus,

2555
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:07,350
there are known benefits of
a regular meditation practice

2556
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,960
for reducing inflammatory cytokines,

2557
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,580
even improving outcomes in cancer,

2558
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:15,300
reducing pain, improving mood,

2559
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,390
reducing the symptoms of ADHD
and clinically diagnosed HD

2560
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:20,040
and on and on and on.

2561
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,020
And, again, rather than focus

2562
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:24,210
on all those beautiful studies today

2563
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:25,650
which all basically point to the fact

2564
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:28,800
that some meditation
practice done regularly,

2565
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,940
even if it's very brief,

2566
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,790
has tremendous, even outsized
benefits on our health

2567
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:36,210
even relative to some drug
treatments, that's been shown.

2568
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:38,790
Rather than focus on all
that, I've been more focused

2569
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:41,250
on what sorts of brain
and body changes occur

2570
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,660
when we do a meditation practice

2571
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:43,860
and, perhaps more importantly,

2572
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,680
what really constitutes
a meditation practice.

2573
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,710
We have this thing about
a continuum of perception.

2574
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,570
We also now are talking about breathing.

2575
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:54,660
Well, there's another component
that I'd like to raise now,

2576
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,400
which we could say is
the third major component

2577
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,230
if the first one that I raised

2578
01:40:58,230 --> 01:41:02,370
was interoceptive versus
exteroceptive bias or continuum,

2579
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:04,040
the second being breathing,

2580
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:07,140
is it going to be default
or deliberate breathing?

2581
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,750
Is it going to be natural
cadence or unnatural cadence?

2582
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:12,090
Again, no right or wrong,

2583
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:13,980
it just depends on what your goal is.

2584
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,960
There's a third component.

2585
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,100
This is a component,

2586
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,290
again, that hasn't really been
formalized in the literature

2587
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:22,300
but that Dr. Spiegel and I
are working hard to formalize

2588
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,710
through some research and
through an upcoming review

2589
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:27,510
that we will provide
links to once it's out,

2590
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:30,750
and that's a separate continuum
which is the continuum

2591
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:35,190
between interoception and dissociation.

2592
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:38,010
So now all of you know
what interoception is,

2593
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:40,110
but most people probably don't know

2594
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:42,840
or don't realize what dissociation is.

2595
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,150
Often we hear about dissociation,

2596
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:47,280
sometimes called disassociation.

2597
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,000
Some people pronounce it
dissociation. Guess what?

2598
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,530
Despite being corrected many times

2599
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:54,030
for each of those pronunciations,

2600
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:55,440
I checked with my colleagues

2601
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:59,550
who are experts in
dissociation or disassociation,

2602
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:00,383
and guess what?

2603
01:42:00,383 --> 01:42:03,780
They're the same thing.
Tomato, tomato, potato, potato.

2604
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,700
So I'm going to say dissociation.

2605
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:09,510
Some people will say
disassociation, like I disassociate.

2606
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:12,330
Other people will say I dissociate, okay?

2607
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:15,600
Both of those refer to
essentially the same thing.

2608
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,230
Dissociation is often talked about

2609
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:21,270
in the context of a negative event.

2610
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:25,470
And indeed, dissociation is unfortunately,

2611
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:28,260
or, I should say, is adaptively associated

2612
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:29,880
with traumatic events.

2613
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:33,300
In particular, violent or sexual
trauma, people will report

2614
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,410
feeling out of body or
out of the experience

2615
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:38,250
during the experience

2616
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,400
or during a recollection
of the experience.

2617
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:43,650
Dissociation has also been described

2618
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:46,980
in terms of people who are
in a traumatic accident

2619
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,260
or they see someone killed
right in front of them.

2620
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:51,270
First responders will
talk about dissociating

2621
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:52,470
when they arrive on a scene.

2622
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,390
I don't want to provide, you
know, gruesome imagery here

2623
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:56,040
'cause I know people can be
pretty sensitive to this,

2624
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,580
but, you know, showing up
on the scene of a car crash

2625
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:04,260
and just seeing carnage or
incredible damage to bodies

2626
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,030
or, you know, this sort of thing.

2627
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:08,190
Dissociation lies at the opposite end

2628
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:10,530
of a continuum with interoception.

2629
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:12,480
Now, earlier, I said that interoception

2630
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,270
is on the opposite end of a
continuum with exteroception,

2631
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:17,190
but it also is on the opposite end

2632
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:20,130
of a continuum with dissociation.

2633
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:22,440
We can provide some
better definitions perhaps

2634
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,060
to make this crystal clear,

2635
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:26,580
and here, I'm actually reading
from an upcoming review.

2636
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:27,690
I feel comfortable reading from it

2637
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:29,100
because I'm an author on the review.

2638
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,950
But nonetheless, interoception
refers to a process

2639
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:33,240
by which your nervous system,

2640
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,860
meaning your brain and
connections with your body,

2641
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:37,890
senses, interprets, integrates,
and regulates signals

2642
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:40,560
originating from within the body,

2643
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,840
and thereby provides a
moment-to-moment mapping

2644
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,520
of your internal landscape

2645
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,470
at both a conscious and unconscious level.

2646
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,880
Okay, that's a lot of words

2647
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,010
to describe basically the process

2648
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:51,090
of perceiving what's happening

2649
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:54,153
at the level of the surface
of your skin or inward.

2650
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:57,300
Dissociation can be thought of

2651
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:00,510
as the opposite of interoception.

2652
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:02,280
It's a lack of bodily awareness

2653
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:06,030
or a removal of one's conscious experience

2654
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:09,360
from one's bodily
experience and awareness.

2655
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,250
Again, this is most often talked about

2656
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:13,260
in the context of something traumatic,

2657
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:16,050
but really, if we think about health

2658
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:18,090
and mental health and physical health,

2659
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:19,740
the optimal place to reside

2660
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:22,800
on the continuum between
interoception and dissociation

2661
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,940
is somewhere in the middle.

2662
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:26,730
We don't want to be dissociated
from life's experiences,

2663
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:30,510
but we also don't want everything
that happens in the world

2664
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:33,090
to profoundly impact our
heart rate and our breathing.

2665
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:35,940
We'd be yanked around by every experience.

2666
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:39,780
There are instances in
which being yanked around

2667
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,310
or pulled into an experience

2668
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:42,690
is something that we desire and want,

2669
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:45,030
like seeing a movie that we want to see

2670
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:50,030
or, for instance, clinical
hypnosis or falling in love,

2671
01:44:50,430 --> 01:44:51,540
wonderful experiences

2672
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,700
and sometimes also sad experiences, right?

2673
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,050
Being able to feel one's feelings

2674
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:58,110
depending on life's events is important.

2675
01:44:58,110 --> 01:45:02,310
But being too dissociated
or being too feeling,

2676
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:04,440
that is, feeling so much

2677
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,740
in response to everything that
happens is also problematic.

2678
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:10,440
There are certain people, for
instance, that have challenges

2679
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:13,110
with what's called narrative distancing.

2680
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:15,180
That is, they see someone
in a movie getting hit

2681
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:18,300
and they almost flinch as
if they are getting hit.

2682
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,870
They see someone who's
scared or happy in a movie

2683
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:23,400
and they feel scared or happy

2684
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:26,130
in a way that seems like
they're along for the ride

2685
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:28,170
a little bit too much.

2686
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:30,540
This is important
because what it speaks to

2687
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,160
is the ability for that...

2688
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,110
Remember way back at the
beginning of the episode,

2689
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:37,293
that ACC, that anterior
cingulate cortex and the insula.

2690
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:39,450
We've got a prefrontal cortex

2691
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:42,390
that can say, hey, let's be rational.

2692
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:45,120
That movie, that person
who's happy or sad,

2693
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:48,450
that person in your environment
who's breaking down crying,

2694
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:50,880
yes, they're sad, it's
important to be sympathetic,

2695
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,950
maybe even empathic towards them,

2696
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:54,930
but let's not get pulled
into the experience

2697
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,700
so much that we lose ourselves.

2698
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,580
And then of course there
are areas of your brain

2699
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:04,200
that are also leaning on,
and here I'm using metaphor,

2700
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,770
but they're leaning on the
insula and ACC and saying,

2701
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:10,080
hey, there's somebody that
I care about that's upset,

2702
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,220
I'm also going to be upset,

2703
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,450
or somebody I care about is happy,

2704
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:13,740
I'm also going to be happy,

2705
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:15,330
or they're scared so I'm
also going to be scared.

2706
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:18,540
So it's a push-pull
between our recognition

2707
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,730
that we are each distinct entities

2708
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:23,160
and also, of course,
the very healthy desire

2709
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,440
to be attached to others' experiences

2710
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,210
and the experiences around us.

2711
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:30,030
So why am I raising yet
another continuum, right?

2712
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:31,950
We already have the one continuum

2713
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:35,430
of interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness.

2714
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:38,580
Well, if we want to think
about how meditation

2715
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:42,723
can serve our mental health
and our ability to focus,

2716
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:48,000
there's a very particular mental
model that we can arrive at

2717
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,380
that incorporates this
interoceptive-dissociative continuum.

2718
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,690
Again, if you are extremely interoceptive,

2719
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:57,810
you're feeling everything in your body,

2720
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,010
and those feelings in your body

2721
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:01,410
nearly completely account
for all of your experience

2722
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:03,480
if you're at that far
end of the continuum.

2723
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,730
On the dissociative end of things,

2724
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,560
you can see what's going on,

2725
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,690
you can react to what's going on,

2726
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:13,260
but your bodily response to
that is essentially shut down.

2727
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,090
You could either be paralyzed shut down,

2728
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:17,100
so kind of no movement,

2729
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:20,130
or you could still be
engaging in behaviors

2730
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:21,660
but you're dissociated.

2731
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:25,350
Again, sadly, this is often
what victims of trauma report,

2732
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:27,150
that they are able to just
go through the motions

2733
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:28,650
but just shut off their emotions

2734
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,480
or their emotions just shut off.

2735
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,120
They aren't feeling the elevated
heart rate or breathing.

2736
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,790
Sometimes they can even be quite scared,

2737
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:37,080
but they're not even perspiring

2738
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,540
or showing any signs of autonomic arousal,

2739
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:43,320
that is, fright or stress or panic.

2740
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,550
So let's talk about this model

2741
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:47,250
of interoception and dissociation

2742
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:49,500
and then a meditative practice

2743
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,010
that can be used to try and
anchor us at the right location

2744
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:55,260
or the healthy location
along that continuum.

2745
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:00,030
Let's first imagine the
ideal mental health state.

2746
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:03,540
And here, I want to
acknowledge, nobody achieves

2747
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,430
or at least maintains
this mental health state.

2748
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:08,310
I want you to imagine that where you are

2749
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:11,820
along this
interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum

2750
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,260
is like a ball bearing,

2751
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,910
or you represent a sphere

2752
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:17,280
that can roll back and
forth along the continuum.

2753
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,290
At one end, you have pure interoception,

2754
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:20,430
you're just feeling everything.

2755
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:22,650
At the other end, you're
completely dissociated.

2756
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:25,950
Well, in this one
version of mental health,

2757
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:29,250
we take that continuum
and we fold up the sides

2758
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,833
so that it looks like a V, okay?

2759
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:33,990
On one end, you have interoception.

2760
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:36,030
On the other end, you have dissociation.

2761
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:37,257
I realize a number of
people are listening to this

2762
01:48:37,257 --> 01:48:38,760
and not watching this on YouTube

2763
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,190
so they can't see that my hands are now,

2764
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:43,800
the heel of my hands are together,

2765
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,260
the fingers of my hands are
apart so it looks like a V,

2766
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,820
and you are like a ball bearing.

2767
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,359
Your state is like a ball
bearing at the base of that.

2768
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:51,192
You are in a trench

2769
01:48:51,192 --> 01:48:55,320
of perfectly balanced
interoception and dissociation,

2770
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,460
so you can feel things,

2771
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:59,130
you can register what's going
on in the outside world,

2772
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:02,640
but your feelings are not
overwhelmed or overtaken

2773
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,050
by what's happening in the outside world.

2774
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:05,220
You are in a perfect place

2775
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:07,050
of being able to make rational decisions

2776
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:09,540
and yet still feel your feelings.

2777
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,980
Wouldn't that be lovely?

2778
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:12,450
Wouldn't that be lovely
if we could be like that

2779
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:13,620
whenever we wanted to?

2780
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,113
And frankly, nobody is
like that all the time.

2781
01:49:17,310 --> 01:49:20,940
More typically, the model
of mental health and mood

2782
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:24,450
and well-being and perception
of self versus others

2783
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:26,610
and internal versus external states

2784
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:30,300
is one of more of a U, a U shape,

2785
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:32,250
where at one end, we have interoception,

2786
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,900
and at the other end,
we have dissociation,

2787
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,100
and it's kind of U shaped,

2788
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:39,930
and your state is more or
less like a ball bearing

2789
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:41,010
at the base of that U

2790
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:43,530
that, you know, it gets
pushed from side to side.

2791
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:46,050
Maybe, you know, your
heart races a little bit

2792
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,970
because of something bad or good,

2793
01:49:47,970 --> 01:49:49,980
and that ball bearing
shifts towards interoception

2794
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:52,470
a little bit more and you notice
that your heart is racing.

2795
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:55,860
Or perhaps, at any given moment,

2796
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,600
you know, your mind drifts a little bit

2797
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,720
while watching a movie or
while talking to your partner

2798
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:03,720
or while your child is
complaining about something

2799
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,647
and you're thinking about something else,

2800
01:50:04,647 --> 01:50:05,790
and that ball bearing shifts

2801
01:50:05,790 --> 01:50:07,890
towards the dissociative
state a little bit.

2802
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:10,287
That is a mild form of dissociation.

2803
01:50:10,287 --> 01:50:11,760
And I think most people would agree

2804
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,530
that being mentally healthy

2805
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:16,350
would involve this kind
of U-shaped model as well,

2806
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,510
where it kind of can shift back and forth,

2807
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:19,470
but it's not extreme.

2808
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:21,720
You're not going from interoceptive-biased

2809
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:24,990
all the way to dissociated
in any kind of extreme way.

2810
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:27,590
The ball bearing stays down
near the base of that U.

2811
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,390
Then, of course, there are states

2812
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:33,900
that we all, frankly, go
into from time to time

2813
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:36,510
where the continuum of
interoception and dissociation

2814
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,520
is essentially flat,

2815
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,460
where you are a ball bearing
at one location or another,

2816
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,590
depending on whether or
not you're watching a movie

2817
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:44,970
that you're very engrossed in

2818
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:46,440
or you're in a conversation with

2819
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,630
or in an activity with your
partner or a friend, et cetera,

2820
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:50,340
that has you very engrossed,

2821
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,200
maybe matching their state, right?

2822
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,310
There are a number of
states you can imagine

2823
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:56,250
where matching one's state
is actually healthy and good,

2824
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:58,050
and then there are a number
of conditions in life

2825
01:50:58,050 --> 01:50:58,920
and situations in life

2826
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,750
where being matched to
someone else's condition

2827
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,770
like you're getting yelled at

2828
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:03,390
and they're angry so then
you're getting angry,

2829
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:04,470
and then pretty soon,

2830
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:08,580
you know, you're not in the
best place along that continuum.

2831
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:09,990
And I think that for many people,

2832
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:12,660
they find themselves somewhere
along that continuum.

2833
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:15,783
And a number of practices,
including meditation,

2834
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:20,010
including exercise, including
getting a good night's sleep,

2835
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:23,250
including therapy, including journaling,

2836
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:24,810
including just doing activities

2837
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:26,430
like social engagement that you enjoy,

2838
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:28,830
are designed to sort of bring up the edges

2839
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:32,670
of that flat continuum into
more of a U or concave shape

2840
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:33,840
so that that ball bearing,

2841
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:37,560
meaning your state of awareness

2842
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,570
and your state of
feeling your own feelings

2843
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:41,970
versus paying attention to
what's going on around you,

2844
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:44,730
is somewhere, again,
biased toward the middle.

2845
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:47,850
By curling up the edges of
that continuum on either end,

2846
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:50,103
it biases that state toward the middle.

2847
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:53,190
And then, of course, there's the extreme

2848
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:55,110
that I think almost everybody would agree

2849
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:57,300
is more or less pathologic,

2850
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,910
which is one in which that continuum

2851
01:51:59,910 --> 01:52:04,290
is no longer shaped like
a deep trench like a V,

2852
01:52:04,290 --> 01:52:05,910
it's not shaped like a U,

2853
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:08,220
it's not flat with the
edges curled up a little bit

2854
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,053
or even flat.

2855
01:52:09,053 --> 01:52:10,980
It's actually now convex.

2856
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:13,170
It looks like a mountain shape, a peak,

2857
01:52:13,170 --> 01:52:14,850
and that little ball bearing at the top

2858
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:17,610
can either drop all the way to one side

2859
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:19,290
of pure interoception,

2860
01:52:19,290 --> 01:52:21,930
just feeling beyond any ability

2861
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:23,430
to pay attention to anything else,

2862
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:25,350
just feeling one's feelings,

2863
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:29,070
being angry, being sad,
or even happy, right?

2864
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:31,590
Being so extremely happy or manic

2865
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:32,940
that you can't pay attention to the fact

2866
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,890
that it's totally out of context, right,

2867
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:36,450
inappropriate for what's
going on around you,

2868
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:39,060
or dropping to the other
side of the continuum

2869
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:40,710
where you're so dissociated

2870
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:42,600
that you're not engaged with
what's going around you.

2871
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:45,093
You're truly, quote, unquote, checked out.

2872
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:51,120
That shape is one that I
think almost all clinicians,

2873
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,410
if not all clinicians,

2874
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:54,600
and most people would say is pathologic

2875
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,990
because you are either
completely checked out

2876
01:52:57,990 --> 01:53:02,490
or you are completely
absorbed in what's going on

2877
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:05,340
within you or around you.

2878
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:08,280
That mental model that I just created

2879
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:09,540
is a simple mental model.

2880
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:11,610
It is by no means exhaustive,

2881
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:13,860
but it does incorporate a
lot of what we think about

2882
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:15,720
when we think about mental health

2883
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,660
and we talk about the ability
to be mentally stable,

2884
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:19,830
to feel one's feelings,

2885
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:21,660
but to still be actively engaged

2886
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:23,070
in what's happening around us.

2887
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:24,810
And again, it's a continuum

2888
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:28,650
that spans from interoceptive
awareness to dissociation

2889
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:30,760
where the extremes are pathologic

2890
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:33,480
and somewhere in the middle is healthier,

2891
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:36,840
and then there are practices that bias us

2892
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,030
toward being in the middle by default.

2893
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:40,140
What are those practices?

2894
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:42,420
Well, we know for sure

2895
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,060
that being sleep deprived, for instance,

2896
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:49,320
tends to take us away
from that trench shape

2897
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,470
or U-shape continuum
or even flat continuum

2898
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:54,990
and starts to make that
continuum more convex.

2899
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:56,730
It tends to make us either feel

2900
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:59,340
like we're completely
checked out and exhausted

2901
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:01,830
or that we are completely labile,

2902
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:05,010
we are yanked around by whatever
experience is happening,

2903
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,540
we are just not able to manage.

2904
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:08,760
So sleep is, as I always say,

2905
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,860
the fundamental or foundational layer

2906
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:12,690
of mental health, physical
health, and performance

2907
01:54:12,690 --> 01:54:15,300
because it tends to put
us in a healthier place.

2908
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,290
That is, when we're getting

2909
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:18,450
enough quality sleep consistently,

2910
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:21,000
it tends to put us in the
middle of that continuum.

2911
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,400
Sleep deprivation does
exactly the opposite.

2912
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:24,510
It pulls us apart.

2913
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:26,670
And when I say pulls us
apart, that's not a real term.

2914
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:29,790
What it does is it tends
to make that continuum

2915
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:32,520
less concave, right, less bowl shaped,

2916
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:36,570
and more convex, more hill shaped,

2917
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:39,360
if not a peak mountain shape

2918
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,510
where it drops us to
one side or the other.

2919
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:47,220
In addition, a meditative
practice done regularly,

2920
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:51,540
because it can allow us to
become more interoceptively aware

2921
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:55,440
or it can allow us to become
more exteroceptively aware,

2922
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,950
which is really just another
form of dissociation,

2923
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:01,230
again, dissociation isn't always bad

2924
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:03,000
provided it's not at the extreme,

2925
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,570
a meditative practice
can actually teach us

2926
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:09,903
to deliberately move along this continuum.

2927
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:12,690
So this is something, again,

2928
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:15,210
that hasn't been discussed a
whole lot in the literature.

2929
01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:16,410
It's been discussed, I should say,

2930
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:18,510
in pieces in different literatures.

2931
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:21,240
If you look in the clinical
psychiatry literature,

2932
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,880
there's a wonderful collection
of studies and reviews

2933
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,790
that will say that interoceptive
awareness is terrific

2934
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:28,170
except for the person

2935
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:30,180
that is so aware of their
internal functioning

2936
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,370
that they are not able
to engage in the world.

2937
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:35,070
Similarly, you'll find
a beautiful literature,

2938
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:36,300
research and clinical literature,

2939
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:39,600
that will say that
dissociation is terrible

2940
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,980
in the case of trauma.

2941
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:42,660
In fact, it can put people in positions

2942
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,580
of repeating a behavior over and over

2943
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,410
that's damaging to them,

2944
01:55:46,410 --> 01:55:48,150
but because they can disengage

2945
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:50,160
or they're dissociated from it

2946
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,440
that they continue the behavior,

2947
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:56,880
or dissociation can be very
adaptive and beneficial

2948
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,140
if it allows people,

2949
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,030
for instance, to create
some narrative distancing

2950
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:01,950
so they're not getting
pulled into every argument,

2951
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:03,570
or if someone screams at them,

2952
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:06,000
they don't necessarily
think that it's their fault.

2953
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,500
They are able to say, "Hey, wait,"

2954
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:08,857
you know, use their
prefrontal cortex and say,

2955
01:56:08,857 --> 01:56:11,160
"Hey, wait, like, just
because you're upset

2956
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:13,080
does not mean that I did something wrong.

2957
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,590
Let's look at the evidence
rationally." Okay?

2958
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:20,040
So in thinking about the positive effects

2959
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,990
of meditation on mood,

2960
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:23,910
there are two aspects that are important.

2961
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:25,290
The first one we talked about earlier,

2962
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:28,620
which is being present to one's experience

2963
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:30,693
correlates with increased happiness.

2964
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:33,780
Having your mind wander,

2965
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:37,620
having your default mode
network be one of mind wandering

2966
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:41,220
actually is correlated
with being more unhappy.

2967
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:43,740
That was the earlier study
that we talked about,

2968
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:45,870
that study published in "Science."

2969
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:48,690
Now, of course, meditation
can make us more present,

2970
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:50,670
but if we do not pay attention

2971
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,680
to whether or not we are
becoming more present

2972
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:55,950
to interoception or exteroception,

2973
01:56:55,950 --> 01:56:59,250
that is, to interoception or dissociation,

2974
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:02,070
and we don't pay attention
to whether or not our bias

2975
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:04,890
is one of dissociation
versus interoception,

2976
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:07,560
we don't know where we
are on the continuum,

2977
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:08,640
well, then the meditation

2978
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,703
actually can make things
worse, not better.

2979
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,220
In other words, if you're somebody

2980
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,790
who has a tremendous amount
of interoceptive awareness,

2981
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:20,190
well, then meditating
on your internal state

2982
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:21,120
may not be good,

2983
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,110
and actually, there's some evidence

2984
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,390
that it may actually be bad.

2985
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:26,070
I'll give you one little tiny example.

2986
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:28,140
I've talked about this
previously on the podcast,

2987
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:30,300
but in that very study
from Wendy Suzuki's lab

2988
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:32,100
showing that 13-minute-a-day meditation

2989
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:34,800
is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera,

2990
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,900
it's also very clear that
for a number of people

2991
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:40,170
that do that typical third eye meditation

2992
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,490
for 13 minutes a day,

2993
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:43,350
if they do that too close to sleep

2994
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:44,610
or when they want to go to sleep,

2995
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,350
they have a hard time falling asleep,

2996
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:47,280
which makes perfect sense

2997
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,710
because they are becoming
more interoceptively aware,

2998
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:51,480
they are ramping up their level of focus.

2999
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:52,980
A meditation practice

3000
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:55,980
typically is a focus and refocus practice,

3001
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,420
and falling asleep involves

3002
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:59,790
turning off your thoughts and your focus

3003
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:02,370
and focusing purely on sensation,

3004
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:03,990
and then your thoughts kind of fragment

3005
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:05,310
and you drift off to sleep.

3006
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:06,270
This is why I'm a big fan

3007
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:09,170
of using non-sleep deep
rest or yoga nidra.

3008
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:11,400
We will provide links
to non-sleep deep rest

3009
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:12,420
and yoga nidra protocols.

3010
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,670
I've talked about them
on the podcast before,

3011
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:18,240
but those protocols are
not meditation per se.

3012
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:22,530
They tend to have people defocus,

3013
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:24,450
they are anti-focus practices,

3014
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:27,690
whereas meditation tends
to be a focusing practice.

3015
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:30,630
Along those lines, a meditation practice

3016
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:33,840
that is one that is
exteroceptively biased,

3017
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:37,320
where you focus on things
that are outside your body,

3018
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,760
can be wonderful for somebody

3019
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,160
who tends to focus too much
on their inner landscape

3020
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,390
and their inner narrative, et cetera,

3021
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:45,000
it can help get them out
of their head and body,

3022
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,800
which can be very beneficial.

3023
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,110
But for people that are not
in touch with their emotions,

3024
01:58:49,110 --> 01:58:50,340
aren't in touch with how they feel,

3025
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:52,770
it actually can drive
them down the exact path

3026
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:54,300
that's wrong for them.

3027
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:56,280
So today's discussion is about meditation,

3028
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:57,150
and we want to make sure

3029
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:59,760
that we are parsing
meditation in a rational way

3030
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:03,720
that matches the neural circuitry involved

3031
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:07,170
and, more importantly, for
sake of practical purposes,

3032
01:59:07,170 --> 01:59:09,750
that you are asking
yourselves the right question.

3033
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:12,300
Are you interoceptively
or exteroceptively biased?

3034
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:13,380
Do you tend to dissociate,

3035
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:17,190
or do you tend to sort of feel everything

3036
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:18,720
in a big way, right?

3037
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,730
I've heard this term of, you
know, hypersensitive people

3038
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:21,563
or things that sort,

3039
01:59:21,563 --> 01:59:23,160
and, you know, some of
those are clinical terms,

3040
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,150
some of them are not.

3041
01:59:24,150 --> 01:59:25,170
But you need to assess this,

3042
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:26,160
and you also need to assess

3043
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:28,680
where you happen to be at on a given day,

3044
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:31,500
which will be dictated, of
course, by how well you slept,

3045
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,390
life experience, et cetera.

3046
01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:36,150
So this interoceptive-to-dissociative
continuum

3047
01:59:36,150 --> 01:59:38,400
is one that you need to address

3048
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,860
prior to any meditative practice.

3049
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:44,880
And, again, the solution
or the answer of what to do

3050
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:47,790
in response to your answer

3051
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:50,010
of whether or not you
are more inward focused

3052
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:52,380
or outward focused, again, is very simple.

3053
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:55,140
Just do the opposite of
where your bias lies.

3054
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:57,099
That is, if you're tilted
towards interoception,

3055
01:59:57,099 --> 01:59:59,460
do an exteroceptive focused practice.

3056
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:02,520
If you are more dissociative and you're...

3057
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,520
That sounds sort of pejorative,
it sounds bad, right?

3058
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,780
But, again, if you are somebody

3059
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:09,240
who is more focused on
events outside your body

3060
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:12,090
and you want to gain more
interoceptive awareness

3061
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:14,250
and feeling state, if you will,

3062
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:16,440
well, then you want to do a practice

3063
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:19,170
that's third eye center
practice or breathing focused.

3064
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:21,660
One of the reasons that
many people meditate

3065
02:00:21,660 --> 02:00:24,540
is that they've heard before
or they've experienced

3066
02:00:24,540 --> 02:00:27,210
that meditation can replace sleep

3067
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:31,680
or can reduce one's overall sleep need.

3068
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,300
So that's an interesting set of questions,

3069
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,460
and it's one that I
dove into the literature

3070
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:36,747
to pursue an answer to,

3071
02:00:36,747 --> 02:00:38,040
and I came up with an answer

3072
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:41,160
that was frankly a little bit
complicated on the face of it

3073
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:43,260
but boils down to some
very simple protocols

3074
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,900
that I think any and
all of us can leverage

3075
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:47,700
in order to sleep better

3076
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:50,370
and maybe even reduce
the total amount of sleep

3077
02:00:50,370 --> 02:00:51,203
that we need,

3078
02:00:51,203 --> 02:00:53,580
something that I think
most people would want.

3079
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,950
You know, I realize that we all

3080
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,080
probably should enjoy
sleeping, I certainly do,

3081
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,490
but that it's hard to get enough sleep,

3082
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:00,510
and wouldn't it be wonderful,

3083
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:03,360
for instance, to be able to
get by on a little less sleep

3084
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,133
and still feel alert and rested?

3085
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,210
First of all, I want to
point to the recent study,

3086
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:11,610
and, again, this is one
that I've raised a few times

3087
02:01:11,610 --> 02:01:13,290
and we'll post a link to it,

3088
02:01:13,290 --> 02:01:17,400
entitled Brief, daily meditation
enhances attention, memory,

3089
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,790
mood, and emotion regulation
in non-experienced meditators.

3090
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:23,160
This is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki

3091
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:26,010
who was a guest on the
Huberman Lab podcast,

3092
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:29,070
who is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences

3093
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:30,330
at New York University

3094
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:33,600
and has run a laboratory focused
on memory for a long time,

3095
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,940
is a terrific neuroscientist
and researcher

3096
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,170
and teacher, et cetera,

3097
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:39,510
and was a terrific guest on the podcast.

3098
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:40,650
I keep returning to this paper

3099
02:01:40,650 --> 02:01:44,100
because they used so many
measures, they were very thorough,

3100
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,270
and the results were really interesting.

3101
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:47,400
Again, this is the 13-minute-a-day

3102
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,020
guided meditation session.

3103
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:52,710
I should just mention that the
control group in this study

3104
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:54,690
listened to a podcast for 13 minutes

3105
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:59,220
that did not improve
attention, memory, mood,

3106
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:03,270
emotion regulation, et cetera,
as much as meditation did,

3107
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:05,550
which is not to say that
podcasts aren't useful.

3108
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:07,320
I won't mention which podcast they used.

3109
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,960
Fortunately, it was not
the Huberman Lab podcast,

3110
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,480
which I like to think at
least increases understanding

3111
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:15,990
of certain key concepts of
science and science-based tools.

3112
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:16,950
You're welcome to look at the paper

3113
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:18,450
and see which podcast they used.

3114
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:20,253
It's a quite well-known podcast,

3115
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:22,440
which is an interesting podcast,

3116
02:02:22,440 --> 02:02:25,170
but it didn't change the
brain in any fundamental way

3117
02:02:25,170 --> 02:02:26,280
in this 13-minute session,

3118
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:28,680
whereas 13 minutes of
daily meditation did.

3119
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:30,480
And, again, something I mentioned earlier

3120
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,730
but very important to reemphasize now

3121
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:34,080
is that they mentioned

3122
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:38,700
that if people in the experiment

3123
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:40,680
meditated too close to bedtime,

3124
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:42,660
they had trouble sleeping,
again, which makes sense

3125
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:45,210
because meditation, at least
in its most common form,

3126
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:46,290
in the form used in this paper,

3127
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:48,900
is a focusing and refocusing exercise.

3128
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:51,570
Falling asleep involves focusing less.

3129
02:02:51,570 --> 02:02:53,820
There are other studies, however,

3130
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:56,490
that have shown, or that asserted, rather,

3131
02:02:56,490 --> 02:03:01,170
that doing two 20-minute
sessions per day of meditation

3132
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:03,663
can reduce the need for sleep.

3133
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,600
Those results are debated.

3134
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:10,200
First of all, understanding
what sleep need is

3135
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,790
is very individual,

3136
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:14,670
and determining what people can manage on,

3137
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:17,970
meaning some people can manage to get by

3138
02:03:17,970 --> 02:03:20,610
with six hours of sleep but
would do better with eight,

3139
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:23,850
some people would actually
manage probably better

3140
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:25,200
in terms of focusing and alertness

3141
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,340
if they slept a little bit less

3142
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:27,510
because they might be waking up

3143
02:03:27,510 --> 02:03:28,950
midway through a sleep cycle.

3144
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:30,450
If you want to learn more about this,

3145
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:33,270
you can check out any one
of three different episodes

3146
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:34,103
that we've done.

3147
02:03:34,103 --> 02:03:35,700
One is Master Your Sleep.

3148
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:37,200
You can find that at hubermanlab.com.

3149
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,970
Everything is timestamped in that episode.

3150
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:40,650
The other is Perfect Your Sleep.

3151
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:42,630
And then, of course, we've
done episodes on sleep

3152
02:03:42,630 --> 02:03:45,840
with expert guests like Dr.
Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley.

3153
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,630
All of those can be found at
hubermanlab.com in all formats,

3154
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:50,160
they're all timestamped.

3155
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:53,640
With that said, this
assertion that has been made

3156
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,710
many times over and certainly
in the popular press

3157
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:59,550
that regular meditation can
reduce one's overall sleep need

3158
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:01,650
is controversial for the following reason.

3159
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:05,310
Some groups find that
indeed that is the case,

3160
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:08,340
and the interpretation is
that the stress reduction

3161
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:11,760
that's brought about by
regular meditative practice,

3162
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:12,960
and in this case, very regular,

3163
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,740
it tends to be one or, more
typically, two 20-minute-per-day

3164
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:17,760
meditation sessions.

3165
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,869
That's quite a lot, I
think, for most people.

3166
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:21,240
I mean, if you think about 40 minutes,

3167
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:23,550
isn't that much time overall,

3168
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:26,190
but very few people will
stick to that twice a day,

3169
02:04:26,190 --> 02:04:29,073
20-minute meditation
practice very consistently.

3170
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,670
Well, the idea is that
the stress reduction,

3171
02:04:32,670 --> 02:04:35,580
which is clear and not debated,

3172
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:38,740
brought about by that type
of meditation practice

3173
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:43,320
is good at offsetting some
of the cortisol increases

3174
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:45,810
associated with reduced sleep

3175
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:48,780
and leading people to be able to function

3176
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:52,500
cognitively and physically
better on reduced sleep

3177
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:53,333
than they would

3178
02:04:53,333 --> 02:04:56,610
had they not been doing
the meditation practice.

3179
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:57,950
So the simple way of putting this

3180
02:04:57,950 --> 02:05:00,660
is that if people meditate regularly,

3181
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:01,770
that's reducing stress.

3182
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:04,590
The reduction in stress
is reducing cortisol.

3183
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:05,730
Again, cortisol is healthy,

3184
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:07,590
but it should be restricted
to early part of the day.

3185
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:09,030
You don't want too many peaks in cortisol,

3186
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:10,580
especially not late in the day.

3187
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:13,470
By meditating, you get the healthy pattern

3188
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:15,390
of cortisol release,

3189
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:17,610
you sort of inoculate yourself somewhat

3190
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:20,430
against the unhealthy
pattern of cortisol release,

3191
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:22,440
and as a consequence,

3192
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,230
either the sleep that people get is deeper

3193
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:28,503
and/or the total amount of
sleep that they need is reduced.

3194
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:31,470
Now, a lot of people took that result

3195
02:05:31,470 --> 02:05:32,850
and interpreted it as saying,

3196
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:36,390
well, if you can't sleep,
then you can just meditate.

3197
02:05:36,390 --> 02:05:38,550
So one night, you don't sleep
or you have trouble sleeping,

3198
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:41,370
you just meditate the next
day and you'll be fine.

3199
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:43,440
Well, certainly that is not
supported by the literature.

3200
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,720
However, there is a practice,

3201
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:47,040
and, again, it's one
that I've talked about

3202
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,540
on this podcast many times before,

3203
02:05:48,540 --> 02:05:49,740
but if you haven't heard me talk about it,

3204
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:51,210
there's a practice called yoga nidra,

3205
02:05:51,210 --> 02:05:53,070
which literally means yoga sleep.

3206
02:05:53,070 --> 02:05:56,400
It is a practice of doing not
so much a focused meditation,

3207
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,540
but more of a body scan

3208
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:59,190
focusing on the sensation of the body

3209
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:02,310
and actually trying to turn
off that prefrontal cortex

3210
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:04,290
or reduce its activity.

3211
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:07,260
Yoga nidra scripts can be
found on YouTube and elsewhere.

3212
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:09,240
They are paralleled by a similar practice

3213
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:10,200
that I've talked a lot about

3214
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,170
called NSDR, or non-sleep deep rest.

3215
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:14,310
I put one out into the world,

3216
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:15,900
a short one that's 10 minutes long.

3217
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,160
You can just simply go to YouTube

3218
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:19,380
and put in NSDR and my
last name, Huberman,

3219
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,213
and there's one there.

3220
02:06:20,213 --> 02:06:22,110
Again, all of this is
completely zero-cost.

3221
02:06:22,110 --> 02:06:25,980
Yoga nidra and NSDR have been shown

3222
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:27,720
in a fair number of studies,

3223
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:30,270
not as many as been done
on traditional meditation,

3224
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:32,700
or I should say third
eye centered meditation

3225
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:34,410
or mindfulness meditation,

3226
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:36,600
but have been shown to replenish levels

3227
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:38,670
of certain neuromodulators like dopamine

3228
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:41,700
and reduce cortisol,
reduce a stress hormone

3229
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:45,120
at least as much and, by
my read of the literature,

3230
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:48,450
significantly more than
with traditional meditation.

3231
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:49,500
And there's a nice paper

3232
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,020
that we will provide a
link to which is entitled

3233
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:54,180
Yoga nidra practice shows
improvement in sleep

3234
02:06:54,180 --> 02:06:56,190
in patients with chronic insomnia:

3235
02:06:56,190 --> 02:06:57,993
A randomized control trial.

3236
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:03,150
Basically, this study looks
at, as the title suggests,

3237
02:07:03,150 --> 02:07:04,920
people with chronic insomnia,

3238
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,050
although the results certainly carry over

3239
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:09,570
or would carry over for people
who don't have insomnia.

3240
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:12,033
The key result, I believe, in this paper,

3241
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:15,457
although there are many, is that, quote,

3242
02:07:15,457 --> 02:07:18,180
"Salivary cortisol reduced
statistically significantly

3243
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,530
after yoga nidra."

3244
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:20,700
What do I mean by that?

3245
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:23,190
There was a statistically
significant reduction

3246
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:25,560
in cortisol levels, the stress hormone,

3247
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:29,580
immediately after the yoga nidra practice

3248
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,050
that we believe would be paralleled

3249
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:34,320
by a very similar if not
equivalent practice of NSDR.

3250
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,450
NSDR is a lot like yoga nidra

3251
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:39,210
but removes a lot of the kind of,

3252
02:07:39,210 --> 02:07:40,770
let's just call it the
sort of mystical language

3253
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:41,603
and the intentions.

3254
02:07:41,603 --> 02:07:45,270
It focuses more on the
physiology and the body scans.

3255
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:46,950
You know, I want to
acknowledge that yoga nidra

3256
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:48,750
has been around for thousands of years

3257
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:50,910
and was certainly there before NSDR.

3258
02:07:50,910 --> 02:07:52,167
I also want to acknowledge that,

3259
02:07:52,167 --> 02:07:55,200
and this was brought up
also in "Altered Traits,"

3260
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,480
that sometimes language can be a barrier

3261
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:59,280
toward people embracing practices.

3262
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:03,030
In fact, this was
recognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn

3263
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:06,060
when he created what he called

3264
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:10,890
mindfulness-based stress
reduction practices, or MBSR,

3265
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:13,350
which was simply mindfulness
meditation to reduce stress,

3266
02:08:13,350 --> 02:08:17,850
but he called it MBSR,
mindfulness-based stress reduction,

3267
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:19,770
as a way to bring it into the clinics

3268
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:21,270
that would otherwise perhaps be averse

3269
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:22,950
to something called
mindfulness meditation.

3270
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:24,690
Again, this gets more to the sociology

3271
02:08:24,690 --> 02:08:26,310
and the cultural aspects

3272
02:08:26,310 --> 02:08:29,010
than it does to any specific utility

3273
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:31,320
of one practice versus another.

3274
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:32,370
Here's the takeaway point.

3275
02:08:32,370 --> 02:08:34,800
If you want to get better at
falling and staying asleep

3276
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,820
or falling back asleep

3277
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:38,340
if you wake up in the middle of the night

3278
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:41,730
or if you are generally
challenged with sleep issues,

3279
02:08:41,730 --> 02:08:43,140
an excellent behavioral practice

3280
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:45,180
for which there are terrific data,

3281
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:49,860
meaning data that show that
a stress hormone, cortisol,

3282
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:51,090
can be significantly reduced

3283
02:08:51,090 --> 02:08:54,900
as well as certain
neurotransmitters can be replenished

3284
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:57,750
as well as, and this is key
and covered in this paper

3285
02:08:57,750 --> 02:09:00,900
that I've mentioned a few
moments ago on yoga nidra,

3286
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,910
that the total amount
of sleep that you need

3287
02:09:02,910 --> 02:09:05,280
can be reduced, at least somewhat,

3288
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,920
well, then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice

3289
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:12,920
done, frankly, any time of
day is going to be beneficial.

3290
02:09:12,930 --> 02:09:14,760
Whereas if your goal, I believe,

3291
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:18,810
is to increase your ability to
focus, to improve your mood,

3292
02:09:18,810 --> 02:09:21,000
and, perhaps most importantly,

3293
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,790
to be able to maneuver
yourself in a deliberate way

3294
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:26,850
along that interoceptive-exteroceptive

3295
02:09:26,850 --> 02:09:29,220
or interoceptive-dissociative continuum

3296
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:30,660
that we've talked about so much,

3297
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:32,880
and to really shift your
default mode network

3298
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,670
from one of being a mind wanderer

3299
02:09:35,670 --> 02:09:39,000
to somebody who can focus
and who frankly is happier,

3300
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,290
well, then a more traditional

3301
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:42,810
third eye center type meditation

3302
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:47,010
or a more traditional
exteroceptive-focused meditation

3303
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:48,270
would be beneficial.

3304
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:50,910
Again, which one of those you
choose, either focusing inward

3305
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:53,400
or focusing on a point outside of you,

3306
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:54,330
again, should be dictated

3307
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:56,820
by whether or not you tend
to be interoceptively biased

3308
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:58,380
or exteroceptively biased.

3309
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:00,570
But if you want to get better at sleeping,

3310
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:02,490
you want to get better at falling asleep,

3311
02:10:02,490 --> 02:10:04,830
and you want to replace
sleep that you've lost,

3312
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:06,060
I put that in quotes

3313
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:08,670
so that my colleagues like Matthew Walker

3314
02:10:08,670 --> 02:10:10,410
don't come after me with...

3315
02:10:10,410 --> 02:10:12,510
What would you come after me with, Matt?

3316
02:10:12,510 --> 02:10:13,650
Probably with an alarm clock

3317
02:10:13,650 --> 02:10:16,230
and, I don't know, blankets and a pillow

3318
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:18,090
or something of that sort.

3319
02:10:18,090 --> 02:10:19,233
In all seriousness,

3320
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:23,520
it's very clear that replacing
sleep that we've lost

3321
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:26,190
is an area of research that's
still active and ongoing,

3322
02:10:26,190 --> 02:10:28,740
but NSDR and yoga nidra
are very promising,

3323
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:31,593
if not downright useful,

3324
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:34,200
for replacing sleep that you've lost.

3325
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,900
Certainly the small amount
of data that exists now

3326
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:38,430
point to the fact that they are,

3327
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,020
not the least of which
is a beautiful study

3328
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:41,760
published out of Scandinavia

3329
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:45,570
showing that a 30-minute
yoga nidra aka NSDR practice

3330
02:10:45,570 --> 02:10:48,180
can replenish levels of dopamine,

3331
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:50,520
which puts people in a position

3332
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:52,920
to be more action-oriented
and focused, et cetera,

3333
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,150
when they come out of the yoga nidra,

3334
02:10:54,150 --> 02:10:56,310
so certainly a very useful practice.

3335
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:59,880
It's a form of meditation, we
could call it meditation-ish,

3336
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,317
but yoga nidra and NSDR

3337
02:11:01,317 --> 02:11:03,420
are not typically what people think about

3338
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:04,560
when we talk about meditation.

3339
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,360
Of course, this is an
episode about meditation.

3340
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:08,060
The reason I bring up yoga nidra and NSDR

3341
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:11,307
is that many people meditate
to enhance their sleep ability

3342
02:11:11,307 --> 02:11:14,400
and to reduce their total
amount of sleep need.

3343
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:17,190
It appears that meditation is
probably not ideal for that

3344
02:11:17,190 --> 02:11:19,140
in comparison to yoga nidra and NSDR,

3345
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:22,500
but meditation is
excellent, if not superb,

3346
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,360
for adjusting the default mode network

3347
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:26,970
toward more happiness by
being more mindful and present

3348
02:11:26,970 --> 02:11:30,480
and for placing oneself
in that healthy model

3349
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:33,540
of interoceptive-dissociative continuum.

3350
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:35,340
So we've covered a lot of information,

3351
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:36,930
and I like to think that I've given you

3352
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:39,000
some key decisions to make

3353
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,400
in developing a meditative practice.

3354
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,450
The most important one, of course,

3355
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:44,700
being what will you do regularly?

3356
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:46,560
And maybe you're somebody who
just answers that question

3357
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,570
by saying, "Look, I'm not
going to meditate regularly.

3358
02:11:48,570 --> 02:11:49,800
I just want to do the thing

3359
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:52,200
that's going to allow me to
feel rested when I'm tired

3360
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:55,650
and is going to allow me
to adjust my state of mind

3361
02:11:55,650 --> 02:11:58,470
when I'm not where I want
to be for whatever reason,

3362
02:11:58,470 --> 02:12:00,510
too anxious or too exhausted, et cetera."

3363
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:01,343
And for those people,

3364
02:12:01,343 --> 02:12:04,140
I would say a practice
like NSDR or yoga nidra

3365
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:05,760
will be immensely beneficial,

3366
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,970
as will a more traditional
form of meditation.

3367
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:11,070
I also want to just remind everybody

3368
02:12:11,070 --> 02:12:13,770
that an app that guides meditation,

3369
02:12:13,770 --> 02:12:17,370
also with some information
and some intention setting,

3370
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:19,830
such as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris

3371
02:12:19,830 --> 02:12:21,660
can be immensely beneficial.

3372
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:23,070
I've certainly found it to be beneficial.

3373
02:12:23,070 --> 02:12:25,350
I know millions of other
people have as well,

3374
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:27,200
so I encourage you to check that out.

3375
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:30,480
We've talked about
determining where you are

3376
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,610
on these continuums of
interoception and exteroception

3377
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,050
in order to dictate what particular type

3378
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:39,540
of meditation practice you
should do in a given moment,

3379
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:41,670
whether or not you
should focus your vision

3380
02:12:41,670 --> 02:12:42,810
inward with eyes closed

3381
02:12:42,810 --> 02:12:45,060
or focus your vision and
your attention outward

3382
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:46,020
being a key component,

3383
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:48,870
whether or not you should
do cyclic breathing,

3384
02:12:48,870 --> 02:12:52,410
which will allow your focus
to be off your breathing

3385
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:54,780
somewhat easier than if you
do non-cyclic breathing,

3386
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:56,760
if you're doubling up
on inhales or exhales,

3387
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:59,070
whether or not your breathing
is going to be natural or not.

3388
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:00,630
And, of course, you need to determine

3389
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:02,250
whether or not your meditation practice

3390
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:05,190
is designed to enhance your
level of focus or to relax you.

3391
02:13:05,190 --> 02:13:06,900
I would say that if it's designed

3392
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:08,850
to enhance your level of focus,

3393
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:12,000
that doesn't necessarily mean
that it won't be relaxing.

3394
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,077
You could do slow cadence breathing

3395
02:13:13,077 --> 02:13:15,690
and third eye meditation,
it could be very relaxing,

3396
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:18,270
and yet it's a focus and refocus practice,

3397
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:21,000
whereas something like yoga nidra and NSDR

3398
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,160
is going to be more along the lines

3399
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:26,970
of replenishing yourself,
replacing sleep that you've lost,

3400
02:13:26,970 --> 02:13:29,463
or maybe even reducing your sleep need.

3401
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:33,030
On previous podcasts, I've
talked about hypnosis,

3402
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:35,010
and particularly the episode
with Dr. David Spiegel,

3403
02:13:35,010 --> 02:13:36,630
our associate chair of psychiatry.

3404
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:38,040
I don't want to get into hypnosis now,

3405
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:40,560
but just understand that
hypnosis is distinct

3406
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,897
from breathwork, from
yoga nidra, from NSDR,

3407
02:13:42,897 --> 02:13:44,430
and from meditation

3408
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:46,830
even though it includes
some of those components

3409
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:48,330
like focusing your attention,

3410
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:50,490
it involves actually directing
your visual attention

3411
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:53,190
outward then inward to
go into the hypnosis,

3412
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:55,170
it involves some breathing
of a particular kind,

3413
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:57,720
it involves a specific imagery, et cetera.

3414
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:01,560
But hypnosis is distinct because
hypnosis is really designed

3415
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:05,130
to fix or address a specific problem,

3416
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:08,280
whereas meditation, NSDR,
yoga nidra, et cetera,

3417
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:09,960
typically are not.

3418
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:12,270
They can help fix problems

3419
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:14,400
such as anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera,

3420
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,770
but they generally are not directed

3421
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:18,510
toward a particular line of thinking.

3422
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:20,580
They can be, but typically they are not.

3423
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:22,650
Whereas hypnosis almost always,

3424
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:24,930
especially in the clinical
context, not stage hypnosis,

3425
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:27,870
but the clinical context for
which there's a lot of research

3426
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:30,900
to show it can, for instance,
help with quitting smoking,

3427
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:34,050
literally a quadrupling
of the effectiveness

3428
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:36,930
for smoking cessation with
something like the Reveri app

3429
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:38,940
than if people just try and go cold turkey

3430
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:43,050
or for reducing insomnia
or for reducing pain

3431
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:45,240
or for any number of things,
including trauma, et cetera,

3432
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:49,290
hypnosis is really great at
dealing with specific issues

3433
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:51,090
and problems and tackling those.

3434
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:53,490
Meditation tends to be
focused on other things,

3435
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:54,720
no pun intended.

3436
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,553
I'm guessing some of you

3437
02:14:55,553 --> 02:14:57,750
are probably wondering where to start

3438
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,150
or, if you're already an avid meditator,

3439
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:02,340
where to go with all this information.

3440
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:03,173
For that reason,

3441
02:15:03,173 --> 02:15:06,300
I just wanted to offer you a
particular form of meditation

3442
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:09,660
that incorporates all of the features

3443
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:12,480
that I've talked about up until now

3444
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,700
in a single meditation practice,

3445
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:17,400
and it's a meditation practice

3446
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,890
that, for lack of a
better name, I called STB,

3447
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:21,510
or Space-Time Bridging.

3448
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:24,600
And the time component has to
do with a very simple fact,

3449
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:27,660
which is when we focus our attention,

3450
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:29,250
visual attention or otherwise,

3451
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:31,560
on things close to or within our body,

3452
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,630
we tend to be fine slicing time.

3453
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:35,280
You could sort of think of your breath

3454
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:39,660
as more or less the second hands
on your clock of existence,

3455
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:42,870
whereas when we tend to focus
on things far away from us,

3456
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:47,700
we tend to parse or carve
up time within bigger bins.

3457
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:51,030
If you've ever seen a
airplane flying at a distance,

3458
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:52,560
it looks like it's
moving very, very slowly.

3459
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,000
If you were right up
next to that airplane,

3460
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,650
it's probably going 500
or 600 miles an hour,

3461
02:15:55,650 --> 02:15:57,330
it would go by very quickly.

3462
02:15:57,330 --> 02:15:58,800
This is not a coincidence.

3463
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:03,180
Believe it or not, how
you slice the time domain

3464
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,710
of your life and your experience

3465
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:06,300
has everything to do with your vision,

3466
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:08,220
and the closer things are,

3467
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:10,230
the more finely you slice up time.

3468
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:12,480
The more closely your attention
is placed on yourself,

3469
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:14,760
the more closely you slice up time.

3470
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:17,220
If you focus your visual
attention very far

3471
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:19,290
or you think about the other side

3472
02:16:19,290 --> 02:16:21,510
of the world, for instance,
and you envision that,

3473
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:25,080
well, then you're actually
slicing time more broadly.

3474
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:26,190
Hopefully that makes sense.

3475
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:29,850
Fine slicing would be like
slow motion, higher frame rate.

3476
02:16:29,850 --> 02:16:30,750
Looking in the distance,

3477
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:32,459
you're actually taking bigger time bins.

3478
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:34,409
So even though things look like
they're moving more slowly,

3479
02:16:34,410 --> 02:16:36,090
it's because your fidelity,

3480
02:16:36,090 --> 02:16:39,813
your precision of measuring
time is actually not as good.

3481
02:16:39,813 --> 02:16:43,950
It's as if you only have
the hours hand on the clock

3482
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,510
so it seems like it moves very slowly.

3483
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:46,740
Hopefully that makes sense to you.

3484
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:47,583
So there's a meditation practice

3485
02:16:47,583 --> 02:16:49,350
that I call Space-Time Bridging

3486
02:16:49,350 --> 02:16:51,780
that incorporates everything
that I've talked about today.

3487
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:54,000
It balances interoception
and exteroception,

3488
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,400
it balances interoception
and dissociation,

3489
02:16:56,400 --> 02:17:01,110
and it crosses the various time domains

3490
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:04,200
that the brain can encompass using vision.

3491
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,879
And it's a very simple meditation,

3492
02:17:05,879 --> 02:17:07,319
it's one that I've been doing for years,

3493
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:09,267
and it's one that we're
starting to do some research on,

3494
02:17:09,267 --> 02:17:10,469
but I'm just going to share with you

3495
02:17:10,469 --> 02:17:13,229
because I think it's actually quite fun

3496
02:17:13,230 --> 02:17:14,879
and can be quite informative.

3497
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:16,229
In fact, people have told me

3498
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:18,510
that it can even lead to
some interesting insights

3499
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:21,180
both during the meditation
and outside the meditation.

3500
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:22,650
It's very simple, what you do,

3501
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:25,110
ideally you would do this
outside or at a window,

3502
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:27,809
but what you do is you
essentially close your eyes.

3503
02:17:27,809 --> 02:17:28,642
I'm not going to do this now,

3504
02:17:28,643 --> 02:17:29,790
I'm not going to close my
eyes and do the meditation,

3505
02:17:29,790 --> 02:17:30,623
but I'll describe it.

3506
02:17:30,623 --> 02:17:32,280
You close your eyes and
you focus your attention

3507
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:34,590
either on your third eye
center or your breathing,

3508
02:17:34,590 --> 02:17:38,190
and you try and put 100% of
your perceptual awareness

3509
02:17:38,190 --> 02:17:40,830
onto your breathing or
your third eye center

3510
02:17:40,830 --> 02:17:43,290
for the duration of three breaths, okay?

3511
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:48,290
So you're 100% or trying to
be 100% in interoception.

3512
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:50,430
Then you open your eyes,

3513
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:52,950
you focus on the surface
of your body someplace.

3514
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:56,100
I find that holding out my
hand at sort of arm's distance

3515
02:17:56,100 --> 02:17:58,139
and focusing on the palm of my hand

3516
02:17:58,139 --> 02:17:59,669
and focusing there visually,

3517
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:02,400
so I'm splitting my attention
now between my hand,

3518
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:04,379
and I'm also going to pay
attention to my breath

3519
02:18:04,379 --> 02:18:07,799
for the duration of three
full inhales and exhales

3520
02:18:07,799 --> 02:18:10,199
while also focusing on my hand,

3521
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:12,959
so you're splitting
interoception and exteroception

3522
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:15,419
as best you can, about 50/50.

3523
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:19,709
Then you subsequently
look at some location

3524
02:18:19,709 --> 02:18:23,429
in your immediate environment,
maybe 10, 15 feet away,

3525
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:26,129
and you focus your
attention on that location

3526
02:18:26,129 --> 02:18:27,749
while also splitting your attention

3527
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:29,250
so that you're still paying
attention to your breathing,

3528
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:31,559
you do that for the
duration of three breaths,

3529
02:18:31,559 --> 02:18:35,339
but now you are in
exteroception and interoception.

3530
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:38,580
Then you focus your attention
at some distance further away,

3531
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:40,170
maybe the furthest distance you can see.

3532
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:42,750
Now, this is why it's
useful to do out of a window

3533
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:44,883
or on a balcony or outdoors.

3534
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:48,180
You focus on the furthest
point, maybe a horizon,

3535
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:50,879
some furthest point for the
duration of three breaths

3536
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:53,339
while also paying attention
to your breathing,

3537
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:55,020
and sort of imagine a
bridge between the two

3538
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:58,290
if you find it to be
challenging to focus on both.

3539
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:00,600
And then, and this is where
it can be a little tricky,

3540
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:03,209
but then what you actually
focus on is the fact,

3541
02:19:03,209 --> 02:19:04,649
and this is not an imaginary thing,

3542
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:07,049
this is a fact that you are a tiny spec

3543
02:19:07,049 --> 02:19:10,259
on this big ball that's
floating out in space, right?

3544
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:11,850
The Earth that's floating out in space.

3545
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:14,250
And you try and focus
on your three breaths

3546
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:15,299
while also acknowledging

3547
02:19:15,299 --> 02:19:17,909
that you are a small body, literally,

3548
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:20,610
on this very seemingly
large body, the Earth,

3549
02:19:20,610 --> 02:19:23,280
but that's floating in
a much larger, larger,

3550
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:27,510
expansive place, the universe,

3551
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:29,549
and you do that for three breaths.

3552
02:19:29,549 --> 02:19:30,779
And then you close your eyes

3553
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:32,830
and you go right back into interoception,

3554
02:19:33,772 --> 02:19:35,039
and you do that for three breaths.

3555
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,410
You focus on your interoception
for three breaths.

3556
02:19:37,410 --> 02:19:39,629
And you might want to march
through these different locations

3557
02:19:39,629 --> 02:19:41,369
a few times or back and forth if you like,

3558
02:19:41,370 --> 02:19:44,700
but typically, I will
just do it for one segment

3559
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:47,250
at pure interoception,

3560
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:51,660
palm of hand, some distance
in front of me, horizon,

3561
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:55,200
whole globe, universe thing,
back into body, et cetera.

3562
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:58,200
Why is this useful? Why
would this be useful?

3563
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:01,080
Is it at all interesting, or
is this just some crazy idea?

3564
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:04,230
Well, the reason it's useful, I believe,

3565
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:08,940
is that it has you deliberately
step your awareness,

3566
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:12,090
your perception through every position

3567
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:16,140
along that
interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum.

3568
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:19,200
Now, I did say to remain connected to,

3569
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,880
as they'll say in the yoga classes,

3570
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:22,500
aware of, I guess would be

3571
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:24,600
the more scientific way to state it,

3572
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:25,650
aware of one's breath,

3573
02:20:25,650 --> 02:20:26,483
but if you wanted,

3574
02:20:26,483 --> 02:20:28,410
you could actually try
and put your awareness

3575
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:29,670
completely outside yourself,

3576
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:31,530
but most people will find
that challenging to do

3577
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:33,330
if they're already paying
attention to their breath.

3578
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:34,230
It's just hard to do,

3579
02:20:34,230 --> 02:20:36,690
so I find it easier to
just split my awareness

3580
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:39,000
from interoception to exteroception.

3581
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,460
But by stepping through
these different locations

3582
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:45,450
and then deliberately
placing your perception,

3583
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:48,390
your awareness back
into pure interoception,

3584
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:52,740
what you do is you essentially
are practicing or exercising

3585
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:55,890
this incredible ability
that the human mind has

3586
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:59,910
to deliberately place your
perception at specific locations

3587
02:20:59,910 --> 02:21:03,270
along the interoceptive-exteroceptive
continuum.

3588
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:04,680
And I think this is very useful

3589
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:06,540
because many of us, including myself,

3590
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:09,510
tend to get locked at one
location along that continuum.

3591
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:10,950
For instance, if you're
scrolling your phone

3592
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:12,690
for a long period of time,

3593
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:14,370
you may forget about
your bodily sensations,

3594
02:21:14,370 --> 02:21:16,020
but you generally forget
about other things

3595
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:17,280
going on in the world.

3596
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:19,140
Or if you're very focused
on things out in the world,

3597
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:21,840
you oftentimes can forget
about your internal sensations

3598
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:24,030
and what's going on internally.

3599
02:21:24,030 --> 02:21:27,120
And being functional in work,
in life, in relationship,

3600
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:30,960
and in all aspects, including
your ability to fall asleep,

3601
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:33,690
involves stepping yourself
along these different locations,

3602
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:36,330
which, again, are not
just physical locations

3603
02:21:36,330 --> 02:21:38,430
of third eye center or your breathing

3604
02:21:38,430 --> 02:21:40,260
or your hand or horizon.

3605
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:43,110
Those are just stations within space.

3606
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:45,330
But remember, each one of those,

3607
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:49,050
just by way of how your visual
system and the time domain

3608
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:50,793
are interlocked with one another,

3609
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:54,360
sets your mind in a
particular time domain.

3610
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:58,080
And so much of what involves
being a functional human being

3611
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:01,440
involves dynamically
adjusting our attention

3612
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:03,180
from what we are doing on our computer

3613
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:05,520
to a question somebody
asks and then back again,

3614
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,230
or from text messaging

3615
02:22:07,230 --> 02:22:10,380
to listening to a lecture or a podcast

3616
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:12,690
or from listening to a lecture or podcast

3617
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:15,240
and then going back into
a mode of commuting,

3618
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:17,310
but making that commute either relaxing

3619
02:22:17,310 --> 02:22:18,690
or maybe do work on your commute

3620
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:21,030
or connect with family
or friends, et cetera.

3621
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:23,820
So much of the fatigue of life

3622
02:22:23,820 --> 02:22:27,900
and the, I should say,
the maladaptive behaviors

3623
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:29,730
and emotions that show up in life

3624
02:22:29,730 --> 02:22:33,900
are really not about any
set of behaviors or emotions

3625
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:36,270
being wrong or right,

3626
02:22:36,270 --> 02:22:38,280
but rather inappropriately matched

3627
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:39,990
to the space-time domain that we're in,

3628
02:22:39,990 --> 02:22:41,580
which, again, is just fancy nerd speak

3629
02:22:41,580 --> 02:22:45,210
for saying being present and being mindful

3630
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:49,320
is a wonderful byproduct
of a meditation practice,

3631
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:52,080
but it is but one of those stations

3632
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,900
along that space-time continuum.

3633
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:57,300
The key element here is to step yourself

3634
02:22:57,300 --> 02:22:58,440
through a practice deliberately

3635
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:01,530
so that you are flexibly
and dynamically able

3636
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:04,530
to engage in conversation,
then disengage and focus,

3637
02:23:04,530 --> 02:23:07,200
or focus and then disengage
from the work you're focusing on

3638
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:10,110
and actually have a
conversation or be in the world

3639
02:23:10,110 --> 02:23:12,900
and move out of that
interoceptive awareness

3640
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:15,630
to one in which you
are dynamically engaged

3641
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:17,550
with the things around you.

3642
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:19,500
I realize this might
sound a little bit vague.

3643
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:20,333
For that reason,

3644
02:23:20,333 --> 02:23:22,770
I encourage you not to
think about it too much,

3645
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:25,500
but rather to try the practice,
see if it works for you.

3646
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,660
If it doesn't, that's fine.

3647
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:29,070
I think it is a good one for people

3648
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:32,070
that find that a third eye center

3649
02:23:32,070 --> 02:23:35,100
or breathing-focused
interoceptive meditation

3650
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,710
might be enjoyable to them
or very beneficial to them,

3651
02:23:37,710 --> 02:23:39,180
but they might want to try something new,

3652
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:40,320
and other people who might find

3653
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:43,050
that that tends to put them
too much in their own head.

3654
02:23:43,050 --> 02:23:45,750
I think it also ought to
be very useful for people

3655
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:48,540
that tend to be overly exteroceptive,

3656
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:50,790
more on the dissociative
end of the continuum,

3657
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:54,330
and need to bring in a bit more
of interoceptive awareness,

3658
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:57,870
but either can't do that or
are uncomfortable doing that

3659
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:59,820
because they're simply not interested in

3660
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:02,730
or comfortable with feeling so
much of their internal state

3661
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:04,170
because that can either be overwhelming

3662
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:06,300
or that's just simply not
the way they want to feel.

3663
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:08,490
Now, as we round up, I
do want to acknowledge

3664
02:24:08,490 --> 02:24:13,470
that there are an enormous
number of rooms within the house,

3665
02:24:13,470 --> 02:24:14,370
or rather, I should say,

3666
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:16,800
within the castle that is meditation,

3667
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:20,490
including, for instance,
intention setting and mantras

3668
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:22,830
and an enormous number
of different features

3669
02:24:22,830 --> 02:24:24,030
of meditation practices

3670
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:27,060
that we simply did not
have time to go into

3671
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:30,150
and/or for which the research on

3672
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:32,453
is not completely ironed out yet.

3673
02:24:32,453 --> 02:24:33,930
And for that reason,

3674
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:36,240
in future episodes in not long from now,

3675
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,730
I'm going to be sitting down
with experts in meditation

3676
02:24:38,730 --> 02:24:40,710
that include neuroscientists
and clinicians,

3677
02:24:40,710 --> 02:24:42,840
but other experts in meditation

3678
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,390
that certainly are versed in those topics,

3679
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:48,840
and where they can't point
to specific research studies

3680
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:52,020
can certainly point us
toward the utility of things

3681
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:54,870
like mantras and intentions as they relate

3682
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:56,880
to getting the most out
of a meditative practice,

3683
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:59,040
so I eagerly await those conversations,

3684
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,110
and I hope you will join
me for those as well.

3685
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:03,480

3702
02:25:34,410 --> 02:25:37,800
It's @hubermanlab on Instagram,
Facebook, and Twitter,

3703
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:39,240
and all three of those places,

3704
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,950
I cover science and science-based tools,

3705
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:42,600
some of which overlaps with the content

3706
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:44,160
on the Huberman Lab podcast,

3707
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:46,260
but much of which is
distinct from the content

3708
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:47,940
on the Huberman Lab podcast.

3709
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:50,130
Thanks again for joining
me for today's discussion

3710
02:25:50,130 --> 02:25:52,560
about the science and
practice of meditation.

3711
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,870
And last, but certainly not least,

3712
02:25:54,870 --> 02:25:56,850
thank you for your interest in science.

3713
