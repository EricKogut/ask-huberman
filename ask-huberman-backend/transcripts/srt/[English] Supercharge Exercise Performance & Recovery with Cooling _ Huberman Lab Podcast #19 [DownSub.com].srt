00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,370
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,973
for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,360
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,880
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,030
This podcast is separate

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,480
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,660
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,780
to bring you zero cost
to consumer information

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,890
about science and science related tools

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,570
to the general public.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,710
And keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,780
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,520
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,140
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,640
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,340
to help you better understand your body

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,810
and help you reach your health goals.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,980
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood tests

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,710
and the simple reason for that

21
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,280
is that so many of the factors

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,980
that impact our immediate and
longterm health and wellbeing

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,230
can only be analyzed from blood.

24
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,580
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

25
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,820
you can get additional
layers of information

26
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,500
that can really support your understanding

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
about what's going on deep
under the hood, so to speak

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,337
inside your body and brain
and what to do about it.

29
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,290
And I think that's really
where InsideTracker

30
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,680
sets itself apart from
other similar tests.

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,340
What InsideTracker
offers is, first of all,

32
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,900
they make the tests very easy.

33
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,240
They can come to your home to
take your blood and DNA test

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,310
or you can go to a
testing center nearby you.

35
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,880
Then you get the information back

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,670
and rather than just getting information

37
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,560
about whether or not the
levels of various things

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,270
are high or low,

39
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,230
you also get to find
out what to do about it.

40
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,880
So it offers directives
related to nutrition,

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,210
to exercise and so forth.

42
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,900
It's really allow you to be in control

43
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,320
of your overall health,
both where you are now

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,850
and its long-term trajectory.

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,490
With InsideTracker, they
also have something which is

46
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,640
it can give you a readout
of your inner age.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,240
They have something
called the inner age test

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,500
that really compares your biological age

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,660
to your chronological age,

50
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,880
something that's of extreme
importance and interest

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,340
because it has to do with
lifespan or predicted lifespan.

52
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,850
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

60
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,620
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,310
Helix Sleep is a company that
makes mattresses and pillows

62
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,800
ideally suited to your sleep needs.

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,470
I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

64
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,940
for the last six months,
and I can honestly say

65
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,410
it's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.

66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,490
Helix Sleep has a quiz that can match you

67
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,870
to the ideal mattress and pillows for you.

68
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,140
It's a quiz that takes
just about two minutes,

69
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,620
asks you questions like do
you tend to sleep on your side

70
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
or your back on your stomach?

71
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,620
Or maybe you don't know,

72
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,760
whether or not you tend to wake up

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,660
feeling too warm or too cold?

74
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,450
Various questions about your sleep habits.

75
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,290
At the end of that quiz,

76
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,370
it matches you to a specific mattress

77
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,200
that's perfect for your sleep needs.

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,270
For me, it matched me to the dusk, D-U-S-K

79
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,280
because I wanted a mattress

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,960
that wasn't too firm nor too soft

81
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
and I really love the mattress.

82
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,370
As I mentioned, I've been
sleeping terrifically well

83
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,330
ever since I got that mattress.

84
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,020
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress

85
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,610
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

86
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,150
take their two minutes sleep quiz

87
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,010
and they'll match you
to a customized mattress

88
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,220
and then you'll get up to
$200 off all mattresses

89
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,610
and you'll get two free pillows.

90
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,950
They have a 10 year warranty.

91
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,390
You get to try it out for a
hundred nights, risk-free,

92
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,470
if you don't like it, they'll
even pick it up for free,

93
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,840
take it away but I really think you will,

94
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,160
I certainly love mine.

95
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,100
Again, if you're interested,

96
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,820
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off

97
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,670
and two free pillows.

98
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,100
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Theragun.

99
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,240
Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device

100
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,700
that releases deep muscle tension.

101
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,880
I first learned about
Theragun on a lab expedition.

102
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,830
We're actually headed out to ocean

103
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,340
where we were doing diving
with great white sharks,

104
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,290
filming those for our VR fear
experiments in the laboratory

105
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,760
and it was very long days
of carrying Pelican cases,

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120
those are cases these hard
plastic cases with equipment,

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,000
it was diving, we were all
sore and tired all the time.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,817
And someone had brought along a Theragun.

109
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,670
It was the first time I had seen one

110
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,510
and pretty soon that thing
was getting passed along

111
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,149
and became one of the more
coveted devices on board.

112
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,060
Everyone wanted time with this
thing because it was great,

113
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,060
you could give yourself
a really terrific massage

114
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,810
and get deep into the
tissue and relieve soreness.

115
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,470
When I got back, I got a Theragun

116
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,770
and so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

117
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,000
Whether or not you want
to treat your muscles

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,510
because they're tense from working out

119
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,100
or whether or not you just
want to release stress,

120
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,840
it's a terrific tool.

121
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,070
Many of you are familiar probably
with professional massages

122
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,170
but Theragun is
interesting because you can

123
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,370
basically give yourself
a deep tissue massage,

124
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,280
anytime, anywhere, it's also very quiet.

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,060
If you want to try Theragun,
you can try it for 30 days.

126
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,250
They start at only $199.

127
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,680
You can go to
theragun.com/huberman right now

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
and you can get your gen
fourth Theragun today,

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,930
that's the one that I use or
another one of their models.

130
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,630
That's Theragun.com/huberman
to try Theragun.

131
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,500
This episode marks the
beginning of a new topic

132
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,850
for the Huberman Lab Podcast.

133
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,830
As many of you already know,

134
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,400
we go deep into a
particular topic over four,

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,410
sometimes even five episodes.

136
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,320
We just closed out the
episodes on hormones.

137
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
Now we are going to talk

138
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,160
about how to optimize physical performance

139
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,720
and skill learning.

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,080
We're going to look deep
at the science behind this

141
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,570
as well as specific practices.

142
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,450
In fact, today, you're going
to hear about specific tools

143
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,170
that you can use to improve
endurance and strength by up to,

144
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,220
I'm not making this up,

145
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,250
three or four times your current capacity.

146
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,750
This is based on studies
that were done at Stanford

147
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,180
and are currently in use

148
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,683
by collegiate and professional teams.

149
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,470
If you're not a professional
athlete or a serious athlete,

150
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,303
that's okay.

151
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:57,370
The topics, this month

152
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,300
and all the information
we are going to cover

153
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,133
are going to make you

154
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,803
a better recreational exerciser as well.

155
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,950
If you're not an exerciser

156
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,380
and you're thinking
about getting into that

157
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,100
or if you live in the Northern hemisphere

158
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,510
and you're just thinking
about the beach this summer

159
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,670
or fat loss, muscle
building, that sort of thing,

160
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,400
this month we're going to
cover all of that as well.

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,130
There's so much confusion out there

162
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,230
about how to optimize fat
loss, muscle building,

163
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,320
improvements in flexibility, for instance,

164
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,430
or skill learning.

165
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,110
I know many of you, aren't so focused

166
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,230
on the cosmetic aspects
of physical exercise

167
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,410
but are interested in
actual skill learning,

168
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,160
we're going to talk about that too.

169
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,740
I want to just take a moment

170
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,590
to reflect on something
that came up last episode.

171
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,350
If you didn't see that episode,
that's quite all right.

172
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,810
But last episode, we were talking

173
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,150
about the hormones,
adrenaline, and cortisol

174
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,800
and how to leverage those
towards attention and learning

175
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,420
and there was a little bit of confusion

176
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,840
that I want to clarify.

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,380
I mentioned an optimal
protocol for learning

178
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,060
that involves leveraging
adrenaline also called epinephrin

179
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,350
and it involved four steps.

180
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,380
The four steps that I spelled out

181
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,990
were to be calm and focused

182
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,700
while one is trying to acquire
or learn the new skill,

183
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,520
cognitive skill or motor skill,

184
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
then to have a spike in adrenaline.

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,060
I mentioned ways to do that,

186
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,060
using cold or breathing or other tools,

187
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,730
immediately after the learning episode

188
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,050
then to incorporate what I
call non sleep deep rest,

189
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,050
a 20 minute episode of a shallow
nap or some other protocol

190
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,190
like NSDR, non sleep deep rest protocol

191
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,120
of which we always provide
links in the captions.

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,350
And then to try and optimize
sleep later that night

193
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,830
and the subsequent night.

194
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,440
Some of you heard this
and it sunk in right away

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,650
and it was straight forward.

196
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,330
Others said, wait, I thought
from a previous episode

197
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,820
even before that, you said you're supposed

198
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,060
to do non sleep deep rest
immediately after learning, no.

199
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,930
We added another step,
the logic still follows

200
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,090
that you want to be calm
and focused during learning,

201
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,000
then you want to spike
adrenaline at the end.

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,370
Most people get that backward,

203
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,640
they're drinking too much coffee

204
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,260
or even taking nootropics and things,

205
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,180
trying to be really
focused while learning.

206
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,700
Some people are taking
Adderall recreationally

207
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,080
something I don't recommend,

208
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,200
that's actually getting
the whole process backwards

209
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,070
if you look at the data in the physiology.

210
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,360
You want to spike adrenaline at the end

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,090
or immediately after a learning episode

212
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,750
and then non sleep deep rest
and then sleep itself, okay?

213
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,010
Four steps, hope that
clarifies things for you,

214
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,390
if you have any additional questions

215
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,320
please put them in the
comment section below.

216
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,929
Okay, so let's talk about
physical performance.

217
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,949
There are so many variables
to physical performance

218
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,720
and we can manage physical
performance and skill learning

219
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,860
from a variety of contexts.

220
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,640
I made just a short list
of some of the things

221
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,950
that come to mind that
can powerfully impact

222
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,290
physical performance and skill learning.

223
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,210
Some of them are what I
would consider foundational.

224
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,720
They allow you to show
up your current ability

225
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,740
and if you were to disrupt those,

226
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,580
you would perform less well.

227
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,390
So things like getting
a good night's sleep,

228
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,000
things like being properly hydrated,

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,110
things like being well nourished,

230
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,210
whatever that means to you.

231
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,160
I know some of you like
to exercise fasted,

232
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,680
some of you prefer to
have food in your stomach

233
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,583
or have eaten a couple hours before.

234
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,260
There are supplements, there are drugs,

235
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,770
there are different ways to breathe,

236
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,340
there are so many tools related
to mindset, visualization,

237
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,460
there are machines and devices,
it's just a vast space,

238
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,360
but it's not infinite.

239
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,920
And there are a few things
in the list of things

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,480
that can impact and even
optimize physical performance

241
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,080
and skill learning that
have an outsized effect

242
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
that any of you can use.

243
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,890
Many of them, most of them
are low to zero costs.

244
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,770
So today we are going to
focus on what I believe to be

245
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,490
one of the most powerful tools

246
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,730
to improve physical performance

247
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,540
and skill learning and recovery

248
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,430
and we'll talk about why that's important

249
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,580
and that's temperature.

250
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,810
Now many of you might think,
oh, well that's kind of boring,

251
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,420
I want to know about the
magic pill that I can take

252
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,100
that's going to allow
me to dunk a basketball

253
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,120
if I currently can't or I
want to know about the thing

254
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,820
that's going to let me
run further and faster

255
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,250
is going to shed fat.

256
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,900
Believe it or not, temperature
is the most powerful variable

257
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,210
for improving physical
performance and for recovery.

258
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,880
I would argue it's even
more important than sleep

259
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,610
because temperature itself
is going to dictate how well

260
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,623
and when you sleep and the
depth of your total recovery.

261
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,190
There are two aspects to
temperature of course,

262
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,830
there's heat and there's cold.

263
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,670
We are mainly going to focus on cold

264
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,020
as a way to buffer heat.

265
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,000
In a previous podcast episode,

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,820
I talked all about growth hormone.

267
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,220
You can find that episode about
fibroid and growth hormone

268
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,530
and how heat can be a powerful stimulus

269
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,550
for increasing growth hormone

270
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,990
which is involved in
tissue repair and et cetera

271
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,740
and burn fat and improve
metabolism in various ways.

272
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,720
However, cold I would argue

273
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,570
is even more powerful than heat as a tool

274
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,630
and I'm not just talking
about putting ice packs

275
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,400
on sore muscles or slightly
sprained limbs and ankles

276
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,820
and things of that sort.

277
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,230
We're going to talk about cold

278
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,870
from the standpoint of thermal physiology.

279
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,710
This is a literature that's
rich in scientific information

280
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,720
that goes back very deep
into the last century

281
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,580
where physiologists and
neuroscientists figured out

282
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,360
that there are different
compartments in your body

283
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,490
that heat and cool you differently

284
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,630
and that you can leverage
those in order to double

285
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,463
and as I mentioned before

286
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:41,760
even triple or quadruple your work output

287
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,870
both strength, repetitions, and endurance.

288
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,420
So this is not weak sauces that they say,

289
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,820
this is the stuff that can

290
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,720
really shift the needle quite a bit

291
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,700
and it's not just about well once,

292
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,090
it's about being able to
perform well and recover

293
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,520
from that performance so
that you do even better

294
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,110
when you're not incorporating these tools

295
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,670
on days where for instance,
you can't access cold

296
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,290
or an ice pack or an ice bath
or things of that sort, okay?

297
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,530
So we're going to cover cold,
we're going to talk a little bit

298
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,340
about the physiology of cold
and heat and how they work

299
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,170
because as you've probably
heard me say before

300
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,260
if you can understand some mechanism,

301
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,340
if you can just push yourself

302
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,780
through a little bit of new knowledge,

303
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,520
into understanding a
little bit of mechanism

304
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,100
about how you work, you'll
be in a far better position

305
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,510
to implement the tools in the
best and most flexible ways

306
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,810
for your needs.

307
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,250
This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,

308
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,330
I never ever do a just list of the things

309
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,350
that you should do.

310
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,630
I don't believe in that,
just tell me what to do.

311
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,880
First, I tell you why
you should do something.

312
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,240
What's the logical framework
that it's grounded in

313
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
and then we distill that
down to specific protocols.

314
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
For those of you that are
too impatient for that,

315
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,490
there are millions, if not billions

316
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,260
of other resources out
there that will take you

317
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,670
into the cul-de-sac of one
protocol that will work

318
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,300
and then stop working or might
work for you indefinitely,

319
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,970
that's not how we work here.

320
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,620
This is about really
understanding the mechanism

321
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,320
so that you can tweak
things and modify things,

322
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,450
adjust the timing and the dosage of things

323
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,150
and really get the most out
of these tools and protocols.

324
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,450
Everything I'm going to talk about

325
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,050
pertains to both endurance exercise

326
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,600
and strength and speed type exercise.

327
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work

328
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,140
and to some extent, flexibility

329
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,090
but we're going to cover
flexibility in depth

330
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,400
as well as another feature
that's not often talked about

331
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,320
which is suppleness or
smoothness of movement

332
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,963
over different ranges of
movement in a subsequent episode.

333
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,010
Let's start by talking about temperature.

334
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,740
What is temperature?

335
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,380
How does temperature impact the body

336
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,370
and its ability to perform,
including learn new skills?

337
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,590
So everyone probably remembers,

338
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,300
or has at least heard of
the word homeostasis, right?

339
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,130
That the body wants to remain

340
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,770
in a particular range of temperatures,

341
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,690
that it doesn't like to
be too hot or too cold.

342
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,270
And I want to emphasize from the outset

343
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,130
that there are many mechanisms
that are installed into us

344
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,830
by way of our evolutionary
design and our genome

345
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,680
meaning we were just born
with this stuff ready

346
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,763
to keep our body temperature
in a particular narrow range.

347
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,420
Heating up too much is just plain bad.

348
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,280
It's not just bad for
physical performance,

349
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,680
it's bad for all tissue health.

350
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,010
If your brain heats up too
much, neurons start dying

351
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,830
and those neurons don't come back, okay?

352
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,490
You may have heard about neurogenesis,

353
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,080
the ability for the brain
to regenerate itself

354
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,670
or generate new neurons and adulthood,

355
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,420
there's very little neurogenesis
excuse me, in adulthood,

356
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,910
even after anytime after puberty really

357
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,620
and you don't want to lose neurons

358
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,920
in the central nervous system.

359
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,700
If you get too hot, that'll happen.

360
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,700
It's called hyperthermia, you
want to avoid hyperthermia

361
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,300
and you have many mechanisms

362
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,850
that are built into you to
avoid becoming hyperthermic.

363
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,610
The other thing that
happens when we get too warm

364
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,810
is that we have in all of our cells,

365
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,746
what are called enzymes.

366
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,620
You generally know if
something's an enzyme

367
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,970
because it ends in the
letters, A-S-E, right?

368
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,970
So lipase is an enzyme
that exists to digest fats.

369
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,950
You have proteases that are
there to digest proteins, right?

370
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,950
So anytime you see A-S-E
chances are it's an enzyme.

371
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Enzymes are proteins, and they
have a particular structure

372
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,140
and their structure becomes
modified when heat increases

373
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,470
and that's not good.

374
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,370
You want their structure
to be of a particular type.

375
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,610
Imagine a car with four wheels,

376
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,060
let's just say the car is the enzyme.

377
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,510
If it gets too hot, it's like
two of the wheels fall off

378
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,880
and that thing can't function.

379
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,010
So one of the reasons
why the body and nature

380
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,830
goes through so much effort
to build in mechanisms

381
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,990
to make sure that we don't become too warm

382
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,040
is because when we get to warm,

383
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,500
these enzymes don't function,
cells stop functioning,

384
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,760
they stop being able to generate energy,

385
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,430
they stop being able to digest things,

386
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,320
you stop being able to think

387
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,520
and eventually those cells
start dying off entirely.

388
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,640
So keeping temperature in a
particular range is really good,

389
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,490
you don't want to get too hot.

390
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,820
We have much more flexibility
in terms of getting cold.

391
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,100
Now you don't want to
become hypothermic either.

392
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,500
You can die from hypothermia

393
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,170
just like you can die from hyperthermia.

394
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,170
However that you have a
lot more range to be cold

395
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,980
than you do to be too warm, okay?

396
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,670
And in general, the idea is
to keep the body and brain

397
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,943
in a particular range but
anytime we do anything,

398
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,880
our body temperature can shift.

399
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,020
So for instance, if you were
to stand next to a campfire

400
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,100
or you were outside on a hot day,

401
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,990
various things would happen
to dump heat from your body.

402
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,619
If you were outside on a cold day

403
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,759
or you were to get into a
cold shower or a cold lake,

404
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,859
various things would happen

405
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,439
to insulate heat within your body.

406
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,069
This is all pretty straightforward
and obvious I realize.

407
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,669
Now, what are those things?

408
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,220
Well, there are a huge category of them.

409
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,030
When you get into cold water,
you secrete adrenaline.

410
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,250
On a hot day, if it's really
hot or in a very hot sauna

411
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,083
or in the hot desert,

412
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,480
you will generate what are
called heat shock proteins

413
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,560
which will set off other sets of cascades,

414
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,283
metabolic cascades, biological cascades.

415
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,060
But the simplest way to think
about this process is that

416
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,360
when we get cold, we
tend to vasoconstrict.

417
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,680
Our blood vessels tend to constrict

418
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,150
and we tend to push energy
toward the core of our body

419
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,340
to preserve our core organs, okay?

420
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,170
So our periphery, our hands
and our feet and our toes

421
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,950
and our legs become colder

422
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,660
and our core therefore can
maintain blood to that area

423
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,563
and we are insulating our core.

424
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,910
Conversely, when we heat up
our blood vessels vasodilate,

425
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,060
they expand a bit and more
blood flows to our periphery

426
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,260
and more blood can move
throughout the body generally

427
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,580
and we will perspire, we will
sweat, water will actually

428
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,150
get pulled out of the
blood to some extent,

429
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,660
moved up through sweat glands

430
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,220
and will be brought to the skin surface

431
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,840
so that it can be dumped,
we are dumping heat.

432
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,650
Animals, as you know vary
in their capacity to sweat.

433
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,370
Some animals like camels
won't start sweating at first

434
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,560
if they heat up, what
they'll do is they'll spit,

435
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,260
they'll dump heat by spitting, okay?

436
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,350
Dogs pant, Castilla is
off to my left here,

437
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,880
he pants when he gets
too warm, he can't sweat

438
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,720
or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit.

439
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,700
But we can sweat and
you've probably noticed

440
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,350
that on a humid hot day,
you'll feel much warmer

441
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,830
just walking or running than you would

442
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,610
with the equivalent exercise or movement

443
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,110
than you would on a cold day.

444
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,400
And some of you probably
know this, but if you don't

445
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,340
the reason is you sweat on a cold day,

446
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,700
but because the air is dry typically,

447
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,810
you will bring that sweat to the surface

448
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,810
and provided you're wearing clothes

449
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,750
that allow some air to get
out away from the body,

450
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,170
so you're not wearing,
you know, really tight,

451
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,253
you know spandex type clothing
or something like that,

452
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,750
or, you know seal type
saran wrap type clothing

453
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,470
that sweat will evaporate
off into the dry atmosphere.

454
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,180
Whereas on a humid day,
the reason you see people

455
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,690
in New York and Florida
on a humid summer day

456
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,410
and they're like moving
their shirts off themselves

457
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,280
and you see people with, you know

458
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,340
big sweat stains and back sweat stains

459
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,020
and all this kind of stuff
is because they're sweating

460
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,340
as they normally would, but it's humid

461
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,320
and so there is the humidity,
the air doesn't allow transfer

462
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,370
of that sweat into the
atmosphere as readily

463
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,680
and so you're hot, okay?

464
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,520
So without the evaporation,
you're going to be warmer.

465
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,440
So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat

466
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,740
and we vasodilate when
we want to dump heat.

467
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,700
When we want to maintain
heat, we vasoconstrict

468
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,640
and we tend to not sweat.

469
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,510
The other thing that happens
is you'll get goosebumps.

470
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,990
So-called goose pimples
they're sometimes called.

471
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,330
Those are a throwback to the time

472
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,800
where we had fur over
most, not all of our body.

473
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,840
All mammals in the cold have a process

474
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,930
whereby adrenaline is
released at low levels

475
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,160
typically into the body,
that adrenaline activates

476
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,650
what are called sympathetic fibers,

477
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,330
they have nothing to do with sympathy,

478
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,430
those little fibers, which are neurons,

479
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,860
those fibers that what I'm
saying are fibers are neurons,

480
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,470
not clothing fibers,
reach up into the skin

481
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,980
so your whole body is covered
with these little tiny neurons

482
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,830
that reach up into the
skin and when we are cold,

483
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,900
they actually mechanically
take the hair follicle

484
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,630
and bend it up, it's a
process called pilo erection,

485
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,360
P-I-L-O erection, okay?

486
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,560
So on a hot day, you
want to dump heat, okay?

487
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,960
So on a hot day, what would happen is

488
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,480
you'd actually not see those goose pimples

489
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,510
because you want the hairs lying down

490
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,860
which actually you would think
that might insulate you more

491
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,050
but we'll actually let
more heat dissipate out

492
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,380
through the skin.

493
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,660
On a cold day, you get these
goose pimples or goosebumps

494
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,890
which are really just
an ancient carry over

495
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,060
from the body's attempt to
make hair stand up on end.

496
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,230
And when hair step stand up on end

497
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,170
and they're very close together

498
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,810
that traps air in between
them and actually creates

499
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,570
a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.

500
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,570
If you've ever seen an animal
like a a Malamute or a Husky,

501
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,320
you might think, oh that
poor thing on a hot day,

502
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,300
what does it do?

503
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,140
You know, with all that hair?

504
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,960
Well, it can be warm so the
animal will typically pant

505
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,020
and its hair will lay down,
which you might think would act

506
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,360
as more of a blanket, but on a cold day

507
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,440
what'll happen is they'll
become very puffy.

508
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,330
Their hair will stand up on end

509
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,660
and that's actually trapping
heat between the hairs

510
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,680
and they're actually quite well insulated.

511
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,300
So it's very important that
if you want to understand

512
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,550
how you can leverage temperature
for physical performance,

513
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,860
you have to understand

514
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,910
that you have vasoconstriction
to conserve heat,

515
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,580
vasodilation to dump heat,

516
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,210
that you are sweating to dump heat,

517
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,700
and you have conservation of fluids

518
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,523
in order to preserve heat.

519
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,520
That's the most important thing

520
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,500
in terms of understanding the mechanisms

521
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,400
of maintaining and dumping heat.

522
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,480
And now the most important
thing to understand is that

523
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,530
if you get too hot, not only
do those enzymes stop working

524
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,240
but your ability to contract
your muscles stops, okay?

525
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm going to repeat this
because it's vitally important.

526
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,600
ATP is involved in the process

527
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,330
of generating muscle contractions,

528
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,960
it doesn't matter if
you're running a marathon,

529
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,520
doesn't matter if you're
doing a yoga class,

530
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,230
doesn't matter if you're
going for a 700 pound squat,

531
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,970
the range of temperatures
within which ATP can function

532
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,920
and muscles can contract is very narrow.

533
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,540
Somewhere around 39 or 40
degrees Celsius, it drops off

534
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,300
and you will not be able to
generate more contractions.

535
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,680
Now that's pretty hot,
but that temperature

536
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,100
can be generated locally really fast.

537
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,500
Now, if you're too cold,

538
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,650
it's true it's hard to
generate muscle contractions.

539
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,450
I got into doing some cold water
swimming a little while ago

540
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,500
and we would joke that, you
know, you come out of the water,

541
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,220
we do no wetsuits,

542
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,070
I'm not recommending
people do this necessarily

543
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,020
unless you're with certainly

544
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,150
with somebody else who's skilled
at doing it, which I was.

545
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,230
And you come out

546
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,290
and you feel like you
have claws for hands.

547
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,330
You can, you know, you
could never text on a phone

548
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,250
for the first few minutes,

549
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,220
I mean, the water was very, very cold

550
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,690
and you can't even move your face

551
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,840
and so muscles will become rigid

552
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,220
but heating up muscles causes
them to fail to be able

553
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,380
to generate more contractions.

554
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,410
Put simply if you get too
hot, you stop exercising.

555
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,760
You may not even realize it

556
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,400
but your will to exercise further,

557
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,930
your ability to push harder

558
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,900
is entirely dependent on
the heat of the muscle

559
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,780
both locally and your whole system.

560
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,330
So let's talk about your whole system

561
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,130
because I just described heat
dumping and heat maintaining.

562
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,730
I told you that increasing heat

563
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,770
makes it hard for muscles to contract.

564
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,630
It will stop you from being
able to run further and faster,

565
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,490
it will stop you from being
able to lift more weights,

566
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,530
more sets, more repetitions.

567
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,810
If you can keep temperature
in range however,

568
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,840
in a proper range, you will
be able to do more work,

569
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,600
you will be able to create greater output,

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,170
you'll be able to lift more
weight, more sets, more reps

571
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,590
and you'll be able to run further.

572
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,441
Now, there are data that I'm going to talk

573
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,910
about in a little bit that
are absolutely striking

574
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,210
that underscore that statement.

575
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,260
There are data from my
colleague Craig Heller's lab

576
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,280
in the department of biology at Stanford

577
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,870
and there are data that
are now being implemented.

578
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,170
They were first implemented
in a grant funded by DARPA

579
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,140
but now in professional sports teams.

580
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,060
Many, if not all the NFL teams
are now using this technology

581
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,740
as well as military uses it

582
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,220
and not just for sports
performance, but also firefighters,

583
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,000
construction workers, other professions

584
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,670
where elevated heat becomes
a barrier to performance

585
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,910
and you can leverage this to
really improve your workouts.

586
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,060
And when I say really
improve, it is striking.

587
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,630
I'm going to give away a
little hint of this now

588
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,790
and then I'm going to
tell you a little bit more

589
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,363
of the data later after
I tell you the protocols.

590
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,690
Proper cooling of the body,

591
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,550
which has to be done
in a very specific way,

592
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,090
has allowed recreational athletes,

593
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,090
college students and typical adults

594
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,130
as well as professional athletes

595
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,300
to go from doing their usual output.

596
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,390
In this case what comes to mind best

597
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,640
would be a particular
professional athletes

598
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,120
that a member of the 49ers at the time

599
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,640
was able to do 40 dips on
his first set, 30, 20, 20,

600
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,860
basically to 10 sets of dips
unassisted with anything else.

601
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,240
That's an impressive

602
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,920
especially since he's a really large guy,

603
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,450
40 dips is as a respectable,

604
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,703
these are strict, full, full range dips.

605
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,160
And then by the 10th set,
there's a steep drop-off.

606
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,780
Using proper cooling of
particular body compartments,

607
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,300
he was able to triple that
within less than a week

608
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,380
and maintain that performance

609
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,830
even without the cooling approach.

610
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,900
So it was actually a
conditioning effect, all right?

611
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,440
I'll get back to this in a little bit

612
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,410
but there are other
fantastic leaps of effort

613
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,830
and leaps of performance
that were demonstrated

614
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,623
including endurance running.

615
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,120
Before I continue any, I
just want to underscore again

616
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,040
that overheating is terrible.

617
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,500
There's a famous example of this.

618
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
This was about 10, 15 years ago

619
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,650
when a number of dietary supplements

620
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,780
that included things like
epinephrin which is a stimulant,

621
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,390
it's a beta adrenergic stimulant,
drugs like Clenbuterol,

622
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,380
which were then banned from the Olympics,

623
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,420
which are still out there
have been in recreational use

624
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,910
which were beta adrenergic
agonist so these are drugs

625
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,820
that sort of mimic epinephrin
adrenaline to some extent,

626
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,400
I know I'm oversimplifying this here.

627
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,610
They improve flat loss because
of the effects on metabolism

628
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,220
but they heat up the body.

629
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,720
And what happened was, this
hit the press very widely

630
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,610
is high school football players

631
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,880
and various professional
athletes were dropping dead

632
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,840
because they were overheating

633
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,870
during practice or in competition.

634
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,760
So much so that Clenbuterol was banned.

635
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,700
Although every once in a while,

636
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,710
somebody gets in trouble for using this,

637
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,050
there was an incidence of this recently

638
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,210
in professional boxing which
was attributed to a bad meat

639
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,890
that had contained the Clenbuterol.

640
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,540
I don't know what the source was,

641
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,620
I don't have any commentary about that,

642
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,880
but it still is in use,

643
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,790
but these drugs increased
body temperature,

644
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,970
increased fat loss, but
carry is severe danger

645
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,600
and that's the danger of hyperthermia.

646
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,790
In fact, I would argue and I
think in talking to some folks

647
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,970
at in various professional
fighting organizations

648
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,420
it's very clear that a lot
of the deaths that one sees

649
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,250
in professional combat
sports may have to do

650
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,090
as much with dehydration and overheating

651
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,500
as it does with getting hit in
the head, which is also bad,

652
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,840
but that things can compound

653
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,970
that can have a synergistic effect.

654
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,680
And just a note about
that and hyperthermia

655
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,530
and it's dangerous as well.

656
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,310
My first project ever in science

657
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,320
was to evaluate the thermogenic
effects of MDMA or ecstasy.

658
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,660
That was my senior thesis
in college actually.

659
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,670
And what we found was that indeed drugs

660
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,950
that remove your understanding
of how warm you are

661
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,600
cause you to not take on
the appropriate behaviors

662
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,280
to cool yourself, right?

663
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,720
So your vasoconstriction
and you're sweating,

664
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,860
those are autonomic,

665
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,340
those are going to happen no matter what

666
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,470
unless you happen to take
something that blocks that effect.

667
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,700
However, there are a lot of things

668
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,100
that we as humans do to prevent
ourselves from overheating

669
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,120
and the main one is stop.

670
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,010
When we are running in the desert

671
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,220
or when we're running very
hard and suddenly we stop,

672
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,070
oftentimes that's because
the muscles are overheating,

673
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,490
it's a subconscious thing.

674
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,950
We won't often think, oh,
I'm really much too warm,

675
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,650
it's just that we stop

676
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,800
and it's a self-preservation mechanisms.

677
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,360
Sometimes it kicks into early,
sometimes it kicks into late.

678
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
Kicks in too late, you can die.

679
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,420
There's an instance in the 1984 Olympics

680
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,140
where there was the first year I believe

681
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,400
that there was a women's marathon,

682
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,610
I think that's correct.

683
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,030
And one of the front runners
or top picks for winning

684
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,490
was heading into the stadium

685
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,270
and all of a sudden, it
seemed as if she was lost,

686
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,660
she was kind of wandering around

687
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,150
not knowing where she should go

688
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,190
and in fact, she was in a position to win

689
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,770
or at least take second
place, at least take silver,

690
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,060
got totally disoriented and
did miserably in the race

691
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,740
and she was hyperthermic,

692
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,710
she was running against
that reflex to stop.

693
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,640
So dumping heat is key.

694
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,517
So how do you dump heat in
order to perform longer safely?

695
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,190
Well, in order to understand
that you have to understand

696
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,700
that the body has three main compartments

697
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,620
for regulating temperature, okay?

698
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,720
We don't just have a
center and a periphery,

699
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,410
we have three main compartments

700
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,640
and there's one compartment in particular

701
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,450
that all of you or most all
of you, I have to assume have

702
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,400
and if you can understand how that works,

703
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,910
you can do tremendous
things for your performance

704
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,660
and for your recovery.

705
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,900
So what I'm about to tell you

706
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,770
will allow you to perform
better in all forms of exercise

707
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,810
and it is not commonly known,

708
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,780
unfortunately, I'm here
to try and change that.

709
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,110
You have three compartments

710
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,990
for increasing or dumping
heat in your body.

711
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,190
One is your core, we
already talked about that.

712
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,390
Your core organs, your heart,

713
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,970
your lungs, your pancreas, your liver,

714
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,050
this is the core of your body.

715
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,120
The other is your periphery,
which are obviously your arms

716
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,310
and your legs and your
feet and your hands.

717
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,820
But then there's a third component

718
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,120
which has their three
locations on your body

719
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,930
that are far better at
passing heat out of the body

720
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,800
and bringing cool into the body

721
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,950
such that you can heat up

722
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,300
or cool your body everywhere very quickly.

723
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Those three areas are your
face, the palms of your hands

724
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,720
and the bottoms of your feet.

725
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,810
Now, the skin on your hands
and on the bottoms of your feet

726
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,330
and to some extent on your
face are called glaborous skin.

727
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,330
That's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S glaborous skin.

728
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,350
And what's special about
those areas of your body

729
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,550
and the glaborous skin
is that the arrangement

730
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,740
of vasculature, of blood
vessels, capillaries and arteries

731
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,410
that serve those regions is very different

732
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,890
than it is elsewhere in your body.

733
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,380
Now, this has ancient roots.

734
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,720
Typically, if you were
another mammal, like a bear

735
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,970
or some sort of ape, you would
have hair all over your body.

736
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,850
Now we all know some pretty hairy people.

737
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,100
I presume you've heard that
there are these hairy people,

738
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,290
I know a few excessively hairy people

739
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,750
and Castilla is excessively hairy

740
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,930
but he's not a person obviously

741
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,930
but all mammals have hair
on their bodies, too.

742
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,303
Some people have very light
hair or very fine hair.

743
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,910
We don't have hair on these
glaborous skin regions.

744
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,080
Now, of course you can have
beard or facial hair growth

745
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,160
but there are still
regions like the cheeks

746
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,510
and other areas that maintain
this special vasculature.

747
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,230
Okay, so technically the hands and feet

748
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,900
are real glaborous skin

749
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,860
and the face is not always
quite classified as glaborous

750
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,090
but these three locations
face, palms of hands

751
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:54,090
not tops and bottoms of feet
are very good at dumping heat

752
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,280
and bringing in cool.

753
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,280
And the reason is there's
a rule in vascular biology

754
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,900
that blood moves from
arteries to capillaries

755
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,010
and then to veins, and then
back to the heart, okay?

756
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,030
So arteries which are
the big ones obviously,

757
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,150
capillaries which are the little fine ones

758
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,440
where oxygen and carbon
dioxide are exchanged

759
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,940
and veins which then bring
blood back to the heart

760
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,393
and other tissues of course.

761
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,960
In these three regions
of your hands, your face

762
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,790
and the bottoms of your feet,

763
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,080
we have what are called AVAs.

764
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,450
AVAs are a very special
pattern of vasculature.

765
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,940
AVAs are described in
the medical textbooks.

766
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,410
You can find them in Grey's anatomy

767
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,770
not the television show

768
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,280
but the actual Grey's anatomy textbook

769
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,190
which is a real thing that exists

770
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,660
and in all medical textbooks, okay?

771
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,450
So let's talk about AVAs and what they are

772
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,020
and why they allow these
three regions of the body

773
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,333
to heat or cool ourselves more readily.

774
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,770
So what are AVAs?

775
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,600
AVAs are arterio-venous anastomosis.

776
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,180
So if you want to look that up

777
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,620
you can just look up
AVAs veins, capillaries,

778
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,563
arteries if you like, but
I'll spell it for you.

779
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,870
A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arterio
venous, V-E-N-O-U-S,

780
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,540
arterio-venous anastomosis,
A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.

781
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,570
Arterio-venous anastomosis, okay?

782
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,690
You want to know about
Arterio-venous anastomosis, trust me

783
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,159
and you want to remember
that they are in your hands,

784
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,379
the bottoms of your feet and on your face,

785
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,370
and in particular on
the palms of your hands,

786
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,770
not the tops of your hands.

787
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,810
Now, before I said blood flows typically

788
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,850
from arteries to capillaries, to veins,

789
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,429
and then back to the heart.

790
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,649
But AVAs are direct connections

791
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,659
between the small arteries
and the small veins.

792
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,080
They bypass the
capillaries to some extent.

793
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,400
They are little short vessel segments,

794
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,140
they have a big, large inner diameter

795
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,290
and they have this very
thick, muscular wall.

796
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,250
And they get input from what
are called adrenergic neurons.

797
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,860
They get input from neurons

798
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,360
that release norepinephrine
and epinephrine,

799
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,060
which allows them to contract or dilate.

800
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,460
Now there's some rules of physics

801
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,530
that talk about how the radius of a pipe

802
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,360
and small changes in the radius of a pipe

803
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,360
leads to massive increases in
the rate and amount of stuff

804
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,823
that can flow through that pipe, okay?

805
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:37,260
There's a rule of physics
that says essentially

806
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,890
that the radius is proportional
to the amount of stuff

807
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,470
that can flow through
something to the fourth power.

808
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,970
We're not going to make
this a physics class,

809
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,020
but if you want to look that up, you can,

810
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,470
you can just look up how
does the radius of a tube

811
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,160
or pipe relate to how quickly

812
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,890
or how much stuff can flow through it?

813
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,380
What you need to know,

814
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,250
even if you don't want to know
any of the underlying physics

815
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,150
is that these AVAs allow more heat

816
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,970
to leave the body more quickly

817
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,390
and more cool to enter
the body more quickly

818
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:12,390
than other venous arterial capillary beds

819
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,773
throughout the body.

820
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:17,630
In other words, you can heat
up best at the face, the palms

821
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,820
and the bottoms of the feet,
and you can cool down best

822
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,650
at the face, the palms and
the bottoms of the feet

823
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,710
than you can anywhere else on your body.

824
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,170
And when I say heat up or cool down,

825
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,250
I mean actually heat or cool
the core end your brain.

826
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,210
Okay, so this is vitally important.

827
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,220
I realize we're getting down

828
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,070
into the mechanistic weeds
here, but you need to know

829
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,530
that these three
compartments of your body,

830
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,740
palms, bottoms of feet and face

831
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,150
are your best leverage points
for manipulating temperature

832
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,340
to vastly improve physical
performance, okay?

833
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,110
I also want to point out

834
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,300
that the work that I'm
going to tell you about

835
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,970
is not work from my laboratory.

836
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,470
It's the work of, as I mentioned,

837
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,220
my colleague Craig Heller's
laboratory at Stanford

838
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,400
and we're going to have
Craig on as a guest

839
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,690
to talk more about these discoveries,

840
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,280
they are his and his
colleagues discoveries

841
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,740
and how you can leverage them.

842
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,193
They're building out
some amazing technology.

843
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:14,530
I had a conversation with Craig yesterday

844
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,130
as a prelude to this episode

845
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,280
and to the future conversation with him

846
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,760
so you're getting the
very latest on this topic.

847
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,700
So what Craig and his colleagues did

848
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,450
really illustrates perfectly

849
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,593
what these body surfaces can do and why.

850
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,730
They were studying overheating
in athletes and in military

851
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,020
and in construction workers
and trying to prevent it.

852
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,700
And they did a bunch of experiments,

853
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,350
I won't go into all of them now

854
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,190
but what they essentially found
was that cooling the palms,

855
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,960
palmer cooling allowed people, athletes,

856
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,030
and recreational athletes
to run much further,

857
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,730
to lift more weight and
to do more sets and reps

858
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,823
to a absolutely staggering degree.

859
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,210
Let's talk for a second, a
bit more about why we stop,

860
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,660
why we shut off effort when we get too hot

861
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,310
because in doing so,
you'll really understand

862
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,960
how and why the best protocols exist

863
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,060
for being able to do more work,

864
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,800
to be able to exercise longer

865
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,440
and actually to feel good doing it.

866
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,110
You actually can make
a doubling of your dips

867
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,920
or believe it or not a
tripling or quadrupling or more

868
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,593
of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.

869
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,043
I mentioned before that
when muscle heats up,

870
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,930
enzymes start getting disrupted

871
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,880
and ATP and muscles can't work so well

872
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,680
and those muscles can't contract.

873
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,470
Let's get a little more
specific about that.

874
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,510
The enzyme that's involved here

875
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,710
is something called pyruvate kinase.

876
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,390
You don't need to know
about pyruvate kinase

877
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,700
but what you do need to
know is that it ends A-S-E

878
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,480
which means it's an
enzyme and pyruvate kinase

879
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:04,930
is essentially a rate limiting step.

880
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,150
It's a critical step that you can't bypass

881
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,530
if you want muscles to contract

882
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,473
and it's very temperature sensitive.

883
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,320
Therefore, if you can
keep temperature lower,

884
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,130
you can do more work per unit time,

885
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,780
you can do more pull-ups

886
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,891
and that actually was done by Craig

887
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:24,520
and his colleagues, excuse me.

888
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,030
The pull-ups weren't
actually done by Craig,

889
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,410
I don't know how many
pull-ups Craig can do,

890
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,990
I'll ask him next time,
both cooled and uncooled,

891
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,680
how many pullups he can do.

892
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,330
But what they essentially did

893
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,080
is they brought someone
into their laboratory

894
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,430
who could do 10 pull ups on the first set

895
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,170
and they were able to get 10,

896
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,100
rest two or three minutes get another 10,

897
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,030
rest or three minutes and
if you've ever tried this,

898
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,460
what you find is that you start dropping

899
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,350
to eight, seven, six, et cetera.

900
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,920
Now, the person might not necessarily feel

901
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,380
like they're overheating,
but the muscle is heating up.

902
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,290
Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,

903
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,290
that these that these portals
in the palms are a great way

904
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,410
to both heat the body, but also
to dump heat from the body,

905
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,120
they used the device

906
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,160
and I'll talk about
what you can do at home

907
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
but a device where they had people hold on

908
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,440
to what was essentially a cold tube.

909
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,350
Now this is crucial, the
tube can't be so cold

910
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,400
that it causes vasoconstriction

911
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,310
because then the cold
won't pass from the tube

912
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,093
to the hand and to the core.

913
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,180
But if it's the right temperature,

914
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,850
it's neither too hot nor too cold,

915
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,850
that cool from the cold
tube passes into the hand,

916
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,400
these so-called palmer regions
and then cools the core

917
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,080
and in theory by lowering body temperature

918
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,350
would allow the person or
the athlete to do more work

919
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,950
and indeed that's what they saw.

920
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,800
The actual data, the specific data showed

921
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,210
that subjects could do,

922
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,690
at least the subjects they worked with,

923
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,310
on their first day with no
cooling about a hundred pull-ups

924
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,650
across the timeframe that they had, okay?

925
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,040
So it might've taken
anywhere from 10 to 15

926
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,160
or maybe more sets depending
on how skilled that person was

927
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,943
but in a fixed amount of time.

928
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,330
Then they came back and did the cooling.

929
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,680
They did it the very next day

930
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,920
which if you've ever trained a muscle,

931
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,740
the very next day typically

932
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,010
you wouldn't do as well in its training

933
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,960
if it took any damage
from the previous session

934
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,120
or you at least do as well,

935
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,190
but you probably wouldn't
do what they then observed,

936
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,750
which was, they started
after every other set,

937
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,200
the person would just hold the cold tube,

938
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,710
cool down the body after every other set,

939
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,110
rest everything else was kept the same

940
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,570
and they found that they
went to 180 pull-ups,

941
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,130
which is incredible, it's a near doubling.

942
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,010
And by doing this repeatedly
over several sessions,

943
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:55,070
over several weeks, they quickly
went in the cooling group

944
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,860
from a maximum of somewhere
between 180 and 200 as I recall,

945
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,240
I'm sort of estimating now,

946
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,570
to 600 pull-ups in the
equivalent amount of time

947
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,120
which is absolutely incredible.

948
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,560
They then repeated this in
a study on the bench press

949
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,720
and actually the bench press
study was pretty interesting

950
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,670
because they actually had a control group

951
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,950
that was admittedly
taking specific amounts

952
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,990
of anabolic steroids,

953
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,630
the antibiotic steroid
was testosterone cypionate

954
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,430
which is essentially testosterone,

955
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,430
and indeed the testosterone cypionate,

956
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,653
the steroid group improved at
a rate of about 1% per week.

957
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,520
There were differences
and the cooling group

958
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,450
basically left all other
groups in the dust,

959
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,710
it was just remarkable.

960
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,630
So cooling the core, I
want to be very clear

961
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,930
that it's not cooling the muscle,

962
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,760
wasn't about cooling the chest alone

963
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,410
or just cooling the palms,

964
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,740
it was about allowing cold
to pass through the palms

965
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,440
because of the unique vasculature
that's there, these AVAs

966
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,630
allowed the subjects to do
far more work per unit time.

967
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,320
And the important thing is that

968
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,370
if they were to come back
after doing 600 pull-ups

969
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,220
or 500 pull-ups, you might say,

970
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,450
well, wow that's going
to create a situation

971
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,640
where recovery is going to
be absolutely impossible.

972
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,680
They could come back, not use the cooling

973
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,220
and they still saw a
highly significant increase

974
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,080
in the amount or the
number of pull-ups or dips

975
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,900
or bench press weight
that they could do, okay?

976
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,900
So what that meant is that

977
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,167
it was both an excellent performance

978
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,150
and an excellent training stimulus

979
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,860
that they were able to recover from, okay?

980
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,410
I don't know if all of
you are following this

981
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,720
but these are the sorts of increases

982
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,180
in exercise output that
are absolutely staggering

983
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,940
and that's why professional
teams and the military

984
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,350
and others capitalized on them
very quickly and use these.

985
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,350
Okay, now you may be asking
what about endurance, right?

986
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,480
Not everyone wants to be
able to bench press a lot

987
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,113
for multiple reps and sets.

988
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,910
And I should just mention
for the bench pressing,

989
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,140
it was, I believe they were

990
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,510
they found people that
could bench press two 25,

991
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,870
so that's two 45 pound plates

992
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,000
on the 45 pound standard Olympic bar

993
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,940
for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10

994
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,100
and then they had them do the same thing.

995
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,410
They did a set, they'd
rest two or three minutes,

996
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,530
sometimes up to four minutes,

997
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,580
then do another set,
repeat, repeat, repeat,

998
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,080
and with cooling, they were able

999
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,450
to increase the amount of work,

1000
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,130
the number of reps with the same weight.

1001
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,380
Sometimes they did have to increase sets

1002
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,280
to approximately double,
so it was pretty fantastic.

1003
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,910
So with endurance, similar
increases have been shown

1004
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,320
and the way that they do those tests

1005
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,430
are a little bit different

1006
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,190
and they also point to a
really important mechanism

1007
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,350
of why we stopped doing work at all

1008
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:42,310
when we perceive that we are
putting in too much effort.

1009
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:44,480
So it gets right to the
heart of the relationship

1010
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,960
between temperature in
muscle and your willpower,

1011
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,370
those are directly related.

1012
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,910
Your body heat and your willpower

1013
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,040
are linked in a physiological way.

1014
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,320
So I'm not talking about the kind of stuff

1015
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,220
that you see as kind of like
clickbait on the internet,

1016
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,760
or like increase willpower
now or become resilient now,

1017
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,060
or never do this again if you
want to be mentally strong,

1018
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,610
I'm talking about a
physiological mechanism

1019
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,030
that exists in the body and
brain that causes you to stop

1020
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,910
or that will allow you to
continue to go harder and further

1021
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,420
than you normally would.

1022
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,820
Okay, so let's talk
about willpower and heat

1023
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,260
and how heat shuts you down.

1024
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,990
In other words, if you are cool,

1025
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,610
if your body temperature
is in a particular range,

1026
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,400
not only can you go further,

1027
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,123
but you will go further if you want to.

1028
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,440
Said differently, if you heat up too much,

1029
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,280
you will stop or you will die.

1030
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,810
Typically people stop, there
are individuals who will push

1031
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,320
to the point where they black out and die,

1032
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,483
in the same way that, and
please don't do this experiment,

1033
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,570
there are people who can
sit down face to face

1034
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,080
and say, let's hold our breath

1035
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,693
and whoever breathes first loses.

1036
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,660
Some people will just
go until it's painful

1037
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,170
and then they'll gasp
and take a big breath.

1038
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,410
There are always those individuals

1039
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,200
who can override that reflex

1040
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,760
and they will go until
they pass out, okay?

1041
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,560
And if you do that in water,
you can very easily die,

1042
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,120
so please don't do that experiment.

1043
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,600
But there's a reflex that
relates the body to the brain

1044
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,260
and the brain to the body
that shuts off our effort

1045
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,970
when we get too hot.

1046
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,960
So what Craig and his colleagues
and now others have done

1047
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,560
is to do a test in the laboratory

1048
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,510
where rather than ask
people to run outside

1049
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,670
until they absolutely
don't want to run anymore,

1050
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,660
you put them on a treadmill
and you set the speed, okay?

1051
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,600
So they have to keep up with the treadmill

1052
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,623
and at some point they quit.

1053
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,240
And you take groups and you do those

1054
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,300
in different temperature environments.

1055
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,390
So some people are running
in a nice chilly laboratory,

1056
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,440
they get their heart rate up.

1057
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,000
So maybe their heart rate goes from,

1058
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,330
you know, 40 or 50 baseline heart rate,

1059
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,130
maybe it gets up to 80 or a hundred

1060
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,810
and then they keep the rate of
the treadmill going the same

1061
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,840
and they'll just plateau.

1062
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,540
So they're getting into a
steady state cadence or rhythm

1063
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,650
and their heart is beating it
more or less a steady state.

1064
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,270
Eventually they'll probably stop

1065
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,910
'cause they have something else to do

1066
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,910
but people will continue
at that temperature

1067
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,820
and at that heart rate,

1068
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,860
unless you start turning up
the temperature in the room

1069
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,000
and at some point they will stop

1070
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,070
and they'll stop much
earlier when it gets hot

1071
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,090
because of something
called cardiac drift, okay?

1072
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,710
So let's say I'm running

1073
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,330
and I'm running at a steady
cadence on this treadmill

1074
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,250
and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute

1075
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,720
or a hundred beats per
minute, doesn't matter,

1076
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,480
let's say a hundred just
for sake of example.

1077
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,680
Well, just making the room hotter

1078
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,430
is going to increase
my heart rate further,

1079
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,690
even though I'm at the same output

1080
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,230
and the brain does a computation,

1081
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,640
it somehow figures out that
there's a heat component

1082
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,870
that's increasing heart rate

1083
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,190
and there's an effort
component from running

1084
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,750
that's driving heart rate.

1085
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,150
And if the heat component
and the heart rate output

1086
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,500
from the effort, get to hit
a certain threshold, I stop.

1087
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,010
Okay, ad some of you may think,

1088
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,450
well there are people who just run

1089
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:11,370
and run and run and never stop,
eventually everyone stops.

1090
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,650
Maybe it's because of the race ended,

1091
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,100
maybe it's because, you
know, everyone else quit.

1092
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,900
I actually saw some stuff online,

1093
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,010
there are these races where people

1094
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,840
just will continuously do the same loop

1095
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,290
until everyone else drops out

1096
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,410
and then one guy or girl
keeps going past everybody.

1097
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,540
But typically it stops
because the race is over

1098
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,190
or because people quit.

1099
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,610
Increasing temperature
increases the rate of quitting

1100
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,740
in part, not entirely, but in part

1101
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,200
because of this thing called cardiac drift

1102
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,130
which you've probably experienced

1103
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,240
if you've been out on a hot
day and you're walking uphill

1104
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,180
you might stop to take a breath.

1105
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,750
If you sit in a sauna, your
heart rate will increase.

1106
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:51,060
Heat increases heart rate,
effort increases heart rate.

1107
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,300
At a steady effort, you'll
have a steady heart rate.

1108
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,150
If you increase the
heat in the environment

1109
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,910
that you're engaging in
that steady heart rate,

1110
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,860
your heart rate will now
go up due to cardiac drift

1111
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,030
and you will quit, okay?

1112
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,230
So Heller and colleagues
have done experiments

1113
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,960
where they do palmer cooling
under these environments.

1114
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,290
And that's wonderful because
not only does it enable people

1115
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,290
to go further and faster for much longer

1116
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,720
that's been shown statistically
significant every time

1117
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,110
but it also protects the brain and body

1118
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,660
against hyperthermia,
overheating, coma, nerve injury,

1119
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,337
nerve death, and actual death, okay?

1120
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:35,730
So you can see why this
is such a valuable tool.

1121
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,730
So what are they doing?

1122
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,860
Well, in this case too they're
having them cool their hands

1123
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,410
and they're cooling the palms.

1124
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,700
Cooling the bottoms of the
feet is a little trickier

1125
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,987
but cooling the face could
actually work as well.

1126
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:49,680
And we're going to talk
about cooling the face

1127
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,220
and how to incorporate this.

1128
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,540
So at this point, I've just really wanted

1129
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,540
to impress upon you not impress
you, but impress upon you

1130
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,190
the fact that you have these
three surfaces of your body

1131
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,310
that are very good at
passing cold into the body,

1132
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,550
such that it cools the
core body temperature

1133
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:09,870
and that's a good thing
for health and safety

1134
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,300
and in order to maintain work output

1135
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,090
over longer periods of time,
or actually just do more work.

1136
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,150
I mean to me the result
is just so staggering

1137
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,440
is the hundred to 180
pull-ups in the controls

1138
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,000
and then 600 pull-ups in the
cooled individuals, right?

1139
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,610
They actually also feel mentally

1140
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,160
as if they can do more work.

1141
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,590
It's not just that they can,

1142
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,710
their willpower is adjusted somehow

1143
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,860
by these shifts in temperature.

1144
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,000
Now, before we continue
and get to the exact ways

1145
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,570
that any number of us can
start to use this information,

1146
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:47,150
I want to talk about the
opposite thing, which is heating.

1147
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,460
And you have to remember
that these surfaces,

1148
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,433
the palms and the bottoms
of the feet and the face

1149
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:55,810
will not just a range with these AVAs,

1150
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,810
these special ways to pass
blood from arteries to veins

1151
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,360
in order to cool us for
better athletic performance

1152
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,250
or to heat us for on cold days
but for both of those things.

1153
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,900
Now Heller and colleagues
and others have also explored

1154
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,140
how these can be used to heat up the core.

1155
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,280
There are times when we
want to heat up our core.

1156
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,950
Typically we hear that most of the heat

1157
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,250
escapes through our heads,

1158
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,780
so we'll put on a hat when we go outside,

1159
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,910
that's actually not true.

1160
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,520
Most of your heat escapes
through your face,

1161
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,360
the palms of your hands and
the bottoms of your feet.

1162
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,403
Now you should know why that's the case.

1163
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,850
What this means is that
for post-surgery patients

1164
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,280
or for people that are hypothermic,

1165
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,570
indeed you want to heat the core, right?

1166
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,850
But actually I was on a swim recently

1167
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,040
where a friend became hypothermic.

1168
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,080
He was kind of slurring his words

1169
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,250
and kind of staggering around

1170
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,950
when we got him back on the beach,

1171
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,950
we brought him over to
the lifeguard station,

1172
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,930
he turned out to be fine.

1173
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,640
Again, this is why cold water swims

1174
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,500
are something that you
really need to do in groups,

1175
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,160
not alone and you really have
to know what you're doing.

1176
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,020
There were reasons for why
this happened that day,

1177
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,900
but, you know we were basically

1178
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,020
people thought we were a little strange

1179
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,550
until they realized what was happening.

1180
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:14,770
We were walking down the beach
basically sandwiching him

1181
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,550
between at our chest
because we were still warmer

1182
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,247
than the ambient environment,
the environment around us.

1183
00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:23,160
And we were pushing our chest against him

1184
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,540
to try and warm him up
to warm up his core.

1185
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,220
In retrospect, that was
the wrong thing to do.

1186
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,900
In talking with Craig and
talking to other colleagues

1187
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,380
that work on thermogenesis.

1188
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,280
What we should have done was warm,

1189
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,410
hit the palms of his hands,
the bottoms of his feet

1190
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,680
and his face because that
would insulate the heat loss.

1191
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,900
Now he was very cold

1192
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,420
so presumably there was vasoconstriction

1193
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,920
of the veins at these locations.

1194
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,730
And so it's not clear

1195
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,810
that that would have been
the only strategy to use

1196
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:56,150
but they have explored how to
heat up post-surgery patients

1197
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,560
and one of the best ways to do that

1198
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,100
is to get warm socks on
the bottoms of the feet,

1199
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,420
get gloves on the hands

1200
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,610
and if it can be done
safely to warm the face.

1201
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,540
Now, of course you don't
want to obstruct respiration

1202
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,970
and things of that sort.

1203
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,390
But again the ability to
pass heat into the body

1204
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,930
or to remove heat to the body

1205
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,440
is best done through these three surfaces.

1206
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,330
I can't emphasize that enough.

1207
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,860
So I mentioned before that
you want to cool the palms

1208
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,950
or the bottoms of the feet

1209
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,700
although that's a little
harder to do or the face

1210
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,030
but not so much that the
blood vessels constrict

1211
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,420
because then you won't be able
to pass cool into the body

1212
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,700
because those pipes got smaller

1213
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,790
and therefore you can't
pass cool into the body.

1214
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,700
So how can you start to incorporate this?

1215
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,420
Well, Craig and colleagues have a company

1216
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,130
that they've spun out through Stanford.

1217
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,220
We'll talk about that when
we sit down with Craig

1218
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,320
that has made engineered devices
that are optimal for this

1219
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,680
that are going to keep
those passages open,

1220
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,690
keep the size of the, those
veins correct to pass cool

1221
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,370
into the body quickly for sake
of elite sports performance

1222
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,210
and even recreational sports performance

1223
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,770
but you can actually
start to incorporate this.

1224
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:05,770
First of all, I always get asked

1225
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,180
how cold should the water be?

1226
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,610
Should it be ice water?

1227
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,810
Should it be very cold water?

1228
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,043
The answer is no.

1229
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,770
If you want to experience
some of this effect

1230
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,710
without a device, one thing you could do

1231
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,110
would be for instance to do, I dunno,

1232
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,830
I'll use the, the, the gym or
the treadmill as an example.

1233
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,580
You could do your maximum
number of pull-ups, stop

1234
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,980
and then you could actually
put your hands into

1235
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,970
or on the surface of a sink
that is presumably stopped up

1236
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,280
with cool water.

1237
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,160
So not ice water, not
freezing cold, but cool water,

1238
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,440
slightly cooler than body temperature

1239
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,000
before you started training
would be a good place to start.

1240
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,148
You do that for 10 to 30 seconds.

1241
00:54:51,148 --> 00:54:54,210
Then you could go back
and do your next set.

1242
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,720
You would repeat the cooling,

1243
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,030
you would want to extend the
amount of cooling somewhat

1244
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,700
so you might want to do that
for 30 seconds to a minute.

1245
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,830
This is not going to be perfect,

1246
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,660
you're going to have to play
with how cold to make it

1247
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,640
in order to get the optimal effect

1248
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,490
but you ought to see
an effect nonetheless.

1249
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,900
The same is true if you're
running and you're fatiguing,

1250
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,350
obviously you don't want
to become hyperthermic,

1251
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,880
cooling the hands or the
bottoms of your feet or the face

1252
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,670
would be the ideal way to dump heat

1253
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,790
in order to be able to
generate more output.

1254
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,260
Now, the face is something

1255
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,650
that we haven't talked a lot about.

1256
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,660
Everything I've told you
up until now also says

1257
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,870
that if you are somebody
who tends to get cold

1258
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:35,170
when you are outside, say in
the winter or even in the fall,

1259
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,180
you tend to run cold, warming your face

1260
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,610
is going to be the most important thing

1261
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,870
that you can do.

1262
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,280
Now, it's kind of hard to do
that without looking strange

1263
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,330
like wearing a ski mask
or something like that

1264
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,350
but that is going to be more effective

1265
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,530
than covering and warming
any other part of your body

1266
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,960
although it'd be quite strange
if you only had a ski mask on

1267
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,930
and you weren't wearing clothes
anywhere else on your body,

1268
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,970
I don't recommend doing that outside,

1269
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,250
that will get you into all
sorts of other kinds of trouble.

1270
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,970
That wouldn't be good for anybody.

1271
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:04,540
But now you understand the
principle and the locations

1272
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,670
at which to deliver heat and cold.

1273
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,750
So let's say that you are out for a run

1274
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,420
and you want to incorporate
this cooling mechanism,

1275
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,500
I talked to Craig about this,

1276
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,750
I said, what would be the
kind of poor person's approach

1277
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,230
to this before this devices
commercially available?

1278
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:24,230
And he said, well, you, you
could take a frozen juice can,

1279
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,040
if you have one of those
or a very cold can of soda

1280
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,000
and you would want to
pass it back and forth

1281
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,680
between your two hands.

1282
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,360
The reason the passing back
and forth is really important

1283
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,430
is because you, again you
don't want it to be so cold

1284
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:40,280
that you constrict those veins portals

1285
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,330
that it will allow cold
to go into the body.

1286
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,630
Now, there are certainly people

1287
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,360
that are working on bike handles,

1288
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,770
and that can actually cool the hands.

1289
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:51,400
You can expect with
the Olympics coming up,

1290
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,990
people are aware of these data

1291
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,580
and are starting to incorporate
it into a number of things.

1292
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,490
Here's what you don't want to
do and there are sports teams

1293
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:00,110
that I won't mention by name or brand

1294
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,953
that have made this mistake
and it costs them dearly.

1295
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,350
You don't want to cool the core

1296
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:09,260
if you want to cool the body, right?

1297
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,700
If it's very hot day and
you're going to train,

1298
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,510
getting into an ice bath first,
sure it will cool you down,

1299
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,080
but it's not going to be as
effective as cooling the palms,

1300
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,930
the bottoms of the feet and the face.

1301
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,470
I have a friend who does some
important work in this space

1302
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,170
with people in various,
let's just say cultures

1303
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,050
where heat is generated quite a lot

1304
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:34,470
and they need to dump heat,
ice packs delivered to the face

1305
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:36,190
are something that they actually use

1306
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,050
in order to dump heat quickly.

1307
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,440
Now, again, you don't want

1308
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,930
to keep the ice pack on your face.

1309
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,760
These are people that are
very high work output, right?

1310
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,500
Firefighters and similar,
at very high work output

1311
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,770
and then they'll put this essentially,

1312
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:53,090
it's like a cool face mask on their face.

1313
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,717
It allow their core body
temperature come down

1314
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:55,720
and then they remove it,

1315
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,120
they're not keeping it on there so long

1316
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,830
that they're getting the
vasoconstriction, okay?

1317
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,100
So there are a number of
ways that you could do this.

1318
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,770
And again, I'm not giving
specific temperatures

1319
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,260
because it depends on how hot that day

1320
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,670
and how hot your body temperature is.

1321
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:10,170
So you can see why there's a
need to create more devices

1322
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:15,170
for this, but you can see
a considerable improvement

1323
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:20,140
in endurance, in strength
and in all kinds of explosive

1324
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,300
and sort of, you know,
explosive power type output

1325
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,250
in athletics by using
these surfaces of the hands

1326
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,040
and bottoms of the feet and face.

1327
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,560
The one that I've tried

1328
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,920
because in anticipation of
this episode was the dips

1329
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,520
where then I would cool my hands,

1330
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,874
I actually decided to cool the
bottoms of my feet as well,

1331
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:40,707
because it just feels good

1332
00:58:40,707 --> 00:58:41,780
and it's particularly hot out lately,

1333
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,840
so no shoes or socks on,

1334
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,680
put my feet into the bottoms of my feet

1335
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,150
just kind of hovering
about a centimeter or two

1336
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,360
below the surface of a bucket of water

1337
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,330
that was just slightly, it felt cool,

1338
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,840
slightly cooler than
body temperature or so.

1339
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,640
It just basically what
came out of the spigot

1340
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,610
after I let it run for a little bit.

1341
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,780
And indeed I saw a 60% increase

1342
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,010
in the number of dips I
can do in a single session.

1343
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,560
So it's actually a
quite significant effect

1344
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,260
and you don't have to be perfectly precise

1345
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,610
in order to do it.

1346
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,130
And of course, if you want to
heat up for whatever reason,

1347
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,610
like you're camping or you're
lost in the environment,

1348
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:19,320
remember these three surfaces

1349
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,400
are going to be the best
way to heat your as well.

1350
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,400
So up until now, we've been
talking about how to use cold

1351
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,460
during a workout in order
to improve performance

1352
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,500
and indeed cold applied

1353
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,970
to the appropriate parts of
the body, the appropriate times

1354
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:36,547
can vastly improve our performance

1355
00:59:36,547 --> 00:59:38,063
and endurance and strength.

1356
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,210
Now, I want to talk about
the use of temperature

1357
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,642
in particular cold to improve the speed

1358
00:59:44,642 --> 00:59:47,910
and the depth of recovery.

1359
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,480
Recovery is obviously vital, right?

1360
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,910
During a weight training session

1361
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,610
or during an endurance session,

1362
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,460
that's just the stimulus for
getting better the next time

1363
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,910
and if you don't recover, you
not only won't get better,

1364
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,993
but you'll get worse.

1365
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:04,440
There's a lot of interest
in the use of cold

1366
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,430
in order to improve
recovery in the short term.

1367
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,890
We see this and probably
the best example of this

1368
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,240
would be fighters in combat sports

1369
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,250
between rounds or athletes during

1370
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,230
in between quarters or halftime,

1371
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,670
that's one form of recovery.

1372
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:23,730
The ability to go back
into the sport very soon

1373
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,310
on an order of minutes,
anywhere from like one minute

1374
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,850
in between rounds and
typical combat sports

1375
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,373
or several minutes and
a half time, et cetera.

1376
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,410
Typically what we see is
people cooling their core,

1377
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,030
cooling the back of their neck,

1378
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:40,070
cooling the top of their heads.

1379
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,910
So it might be, you know,
a sponge with cold water

1380
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,050
over the top of the head

1381
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,010
or an ice pack on the back of the neck,

1382
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,527
or in some cases even
wearing cold ice vests,

1383
01:00:49,527 --> 01:00:51,620
that's actually been done.

1384
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,760
That's going to be a very inefficient way

1385
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,120
to improve recovery of that kind.

1386
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,030
Far better would be to cool the face,

1387
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,860
the palms of the hands
or the bottoms the feet

1388
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,223
for the reasons that I
described up until now.

1389
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,493
Submerging the body in an ice
bath, or taking a cold shower,

1390
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,410
say up to the neck or up to the chest

1391
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:14,060
or getting under cold water
or jumping in a cold lake

1392
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,220
or something of that sort,
or in the locker room,

1393
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,920
getting under the cold shower
also would be a terrible way

1394
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,910
to cool off the body quickly

1395
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,440
compared to the ways that I described

1396
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,530
through the palms of the
hands, the bottoms of the feet

1397
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,350
or the face for the following reason.

1398
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,350
First of all, it's not optimizing
those portals of the face,

1399
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,130
palms the hands and the feet

1400
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:38,020
and in addition, if it's
very cold and you submerge

1401
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,720
or you cover a lot of
the body with that cold,

1402
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,700
you're going to cause constriction

1403
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,120
of the very vessels and pathways

1404
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,220
that allow the body to
efficiently dump heat.

1405
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,760
So again, the key thing
is to cool these one

1406
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,810
or two or three of these surfaces

1407
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,899
but not so cold that you
cause the vasoconstriction.

1408
01:01:59,899 --> 01:02:01,449
So what does this mean for you?

1409
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,990
It means that getting in an
ice bath or a cold shower

1410
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,490
or putting an ice pack
on the back of your neck

1411
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,770
in most cases is not going to be as good

1412
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,580
as splashing cold water on your face

1413
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,130
or even just holding your
face in a damp cool cloth

1414
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,703
or something of that sort.

1415
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,410
It seems kind of counterintuitive,

1416
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,630
you think, oh if I just
jump into an ice bath,

1417
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,370
I'm going to cool down much faster
than if I just cooled these,

1418
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,070
you know one or two or three

1419
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,410
of these select regions of the body

1420
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,270
but that's actually not the case.

1421
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,103
And then of course

1422
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:33,780
there's recovery that occurs
from session to session.

1423
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,747
So outside of the game or the
match or the exercise session

1424
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:43,770
and many people are now relying
on things like cryotherapy

1425
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,520
which requires a lot
of expensive equipment,

1426
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,850
big, you know liquid
nitrogen driven machine.

1427
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,690
Those aren't so common for most people

1428
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,680
or accessible for most
people, but a lot of people

1429
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,840
are using cold baths or
ice baths or cold showers.

1430
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,980
And again, that's not
going to optimize recovery.

1431
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:02,350
In fact, it's going to
have an additional effect

1432
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,240
that is going to potentially
block the training stimulus.

1433
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,490
When you get into an ice
bath indeed, there are,

1434
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,920
provided it's not very, very cold,

1435
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,920
if you get into a cold shower,

1436
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,300
provided is not very, very cold,

1437
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,740
you are indeed blocking
some of the inflammation

1438
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,290
that occurs because of
the training session.

1439
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,080
But in doing so you also
are blocking pathways,

1440
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,616
such as mTOR, mammalian
target of rapamycin,

1441
01:03:27,616 --> 01:03:29,530
which are involved in the adaptation

1442
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,100
for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.

1443
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,270
Put simply, covering the body in cold

1444
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,980
or immersing the body
in cold after training

1445
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,540
can short circuit or
prevent the hypertrophy

1446
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,540
or muscle growth response.

1447
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,040
It has other effects that
can be positive, right?

1448
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,360
It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera,

1449
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,670
it can reduce inflammation

1450
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:53,740
but it can prevent some of the
positive effects of exercise.

1451
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,960
Now, it hasn't been examined
so much for endurance work

1452
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,080
but let's say you come back
from around of endurance work

1453
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:05,080
or run or a bike or a swim,
getting into a cool bath

1454
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:08,520
or cooling the palms, the
bottoms of the feet or the face,

1455
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,440
in my opinion, based on
the science would be better

1456
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,250
than completely immersing
the body in the ice bath

1457
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,570
or the cold shower.

1458
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,210
There is a time and a place

1459
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:20,420
for the use of the ice
bath or the cold shower

1460
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,410
or the cold plunge, those tend to be

1461
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:24,660
when you want to deliberately

1462
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,180
increase brown fat thermogenesis

1463
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:31,740
or when you want to deliberately
work on mental resilience.

1464
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,790
And in a subsequent episode on fat loss

1465
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,080
I'm going to talk about how
to optimize the use of cold

1466
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,090
specifically for increasing
metabolism and fat loss.

1467
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:43,290
But for now, since we're
talking about the use of cold

1468
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,340
for improving performance and recovery,

1469
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,760
the suggestion that I'm going
to provide is based on the work

1470
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,880
of Craig Heller and colleagues
that I've been talking about

1471
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,920
as well as a excellent book
I mainly rely on textbooks

1472
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,410
and special volume books which
are collections of papers

1473
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,960
from experts in a particular area

1474
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,880
that go beyond standard kind
of college level textbooks.

1475
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,960
The one that I've been relying on

1476
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,520
is called "Thermoregulation
in Human Performance,

1477
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,400
Physiological and Biological
Aspects" by Effie Marino.

1478
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,860
I don't know the publisher,
I don't know the author.

1479
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,180
I do recognize some of the names

1480
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,560
of the particular papers there,
but I just want to be clear

1481
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,320
there's no sort of business
relationship or deal with them

1482
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,410
but it's an excellent text,

1483
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,390
it's called "Thermoregulation
in Human Performance".

1484
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,110
You can find it online

1485
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:26,940
if you want to go really deep into this

1486
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,500
but basically what they show is that

1487
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,810
if you can cool the body back
to its resting temperature,

1488
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,470
for and by resting temperature, I mean

1489
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,070
within the range that you would see

1490
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:40,570
at any time of waking
day, but not in exercise.

1491
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,670
So just bringing that the body
temperature down to baseline.

1492
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:45,680
If you can do that,

1493
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,820
the sooner you can do
that after a workout,

1494
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,490
the sooner that the muscle will recover,

1495
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:51,790
that the tendons will recover

1496
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,350
and that the person you

1497
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,560
can get back into more endurance training,

1498
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,160
more weight training, et cetera.

1499
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,080
So cold actually can be a very
powerful tool for recovery

1500
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,803
but to maximize return to
baseline levels of temperature,

1501
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,350
it's my belief based on the studies

1502
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,800
that are published in this book

1503
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,210
as well as my discussions with
my colleague, Craig Heller

1504
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,980
and in reviewing the literature overall

1505
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,980
that just simply cooling the entire body

1506
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,060
by jumping into an ice
bath or a cold shower

1507
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,530
is not the best way to go.

1508
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:23,140
You really want to rely
on one of these three

1509
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,618
glaborous skin portals of the palms,

1510
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:27,050
the bottoms of the feet or the face.

1511
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,430
So now you probably know more
than you ever wanted to know

1512
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,270
about how we regulate body temperature

1513
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,850
and how it can be applied to exercise

1514
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,150
both during the exercise session

1515
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,653
and afterward to optimize recovery.

1516
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:43,680
Many of us, all of us, presumably

1517
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,290
are also eating and drinking
things and taking things

1518
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,670
at various times that
can impact this process.

1519
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:53,070
And so, because of that, we should ask

1520
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:56,690
whether or not those things
are impacting body temperature.

1521
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:59,410
And when we do that, we find
that there are certain things

1522
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,400
that many of us are doing

1523
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,420
that are actually
impairing our performance.

1524
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,610
So for instance, if you are
taking a pre-workout drink

1525
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:09,990
or you're ingesting a lot of
caffeine or other substance

1526
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:13,640
to bring your body temperature
up before exercise,

1527
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,743
you are limiting the amount
of exercise that you can do.

1528
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,640
I can recall a time in college

1529
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,270
when I would drink a lot of espresso

1530
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:25,890
back then ephedrine was
sold over the counter,

1531
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,000
I remember taking it,

1532
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,340
it will really energize you for workouts.

1533
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:33,090
You can generate a lot of energy

1534
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,210
and get extremely focused
taking those things.

1535
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,860
They do increase heart rate,
they can be quite dangerous,

1536
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,210
I don't recommend people take them.

1537
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,680
In fact, I think ephedrine
is now off the shelves

1538
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,710
as a non prescription compound

1539
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:46,550
because various people died from taking it

1540
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:49,260
who were sensitive to
it or exercised in heat.

1541
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,760
But looking back at that,

1542
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,140
I realized it was a foolish approach.

1543
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,340
It was increasing core thermogenesis.

1544
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,860
Sure I might've burned a few more calories

1545
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,270
but actually when I look at the data

1546
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:02,980
that are coming from specific cooling

1547
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:06,560
and how that can so
increase in performance

1548
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,040
if done properly and then I
compare that to the effects

1549
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,070
of taking some sort of thermogenic
compound, whatever it is

1550
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:17,189
some pre-workout or some pill
or high levels of caffeine,

1551
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:20,369
it's very clear that
increasing body temperature

1552
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,960
prior to working out is
the exact wrong thing

1553
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,390
that one would want to do.

1554
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:25,960
You don't want to stay so cold

1555
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,010
that you can't generate
good muscle contractions.

1556
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:31,399
You don't want to be like I am
coming out of the cold ocean,

1557
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,139
you know, with claws for hands

1558
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:36,620
but one wants to have your
body temperature in a range

1559
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:40,053
that still allows you to
work hard and perform well.

1560
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:45,430
Now, in terms of recovery,
things like alcohol,

1561
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,960
we know our vasodilator.

1562
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,470
So those are going to cause
people to drop body temperature.

1563
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:52,636
So you might think, oh, well
that sounds great for recovery

1564
01:08:52,636 --> 01:08:55,089
and I don't think people
should be drinking who are

1565
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:57,270
you know, have problems
with alcohol intake,

1566
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,420
you know, alcoholics

1567
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,399
or they're not of drinking age, et cetera.

1568
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,349
I'm not a drinker, but
I do have a good friend

1569
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:04,200
who's a quite accomplished athlete

1570
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,510
who basically drinks a beer or two

1571
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:10,830
after his long runs or cycling
and you know, his argument

1572
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,710
is well, I'm dumping body
heat and I like a beer

1573
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:16,520
and he's probably right, it's
probably a really good tool

1574
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,450
provided you don't have
issues with alcohol

1575
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,160
that would preclude that as a tool

1576
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,683
or you're not of drinking age.

1577
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:26,340
But anything that you
ingest after exercise

1578
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,080
that would increase body temperature

1579
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,010
is going to impede recovery.

1580
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:32,240
Anything that you do that
lowers body temperature

1581
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,830
provides it's in safe ranges

1582
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,120
is going to accelerate recovery.

1583
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,899
And that brings us to the
whole host of compounds

1584
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:44,339
that people take that can
increase body temperature.

1585
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,950
And many people are taking these things

1586
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,220
in order to increase fat
burning and increase metabolism

1587
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,450
but in my opinion

1588
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,430
it's impeding their
ability to perform well.

1589
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,640
And especially if the performance

1590
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,420
is something that you're focused on

1591
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:01,660
aside from body recomposition,
losing fat building muscle.

1592
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,050
But even if you're focused on
losing fat, building muscle

1593
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,160
you have to ask yourself, is
the body temperature increase

1594
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,210
that I'm getting from these
compounds really worth it

1595
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:14,250
given that it can block
or prevent my performance

1596
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,440
from being as good as it could?

1597
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,370
In other words, is it
worth taking something

1598
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,420
that makes you feel very
energized to go work out

1599
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,570
but then you now know that
you are stopping earlier

1600
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,760
and you're performing
less well, fewer reps,

1601
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,070
fewer steps overall, is it worth it?

1602
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,660
If you had not taken that thing

1603
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:33,730
then you could perform much longer

1604
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,083
and at much higher capacity.

1605
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:39,290
Some of you are probably
saying, well, that's ridiculous

1606
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:42,010
because when I drink a quadruple espresso

1607
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:45,460
and I pop a whatever pre-workout
or drink a pre-workout

1608
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,700
then I know I can go much further.

1609
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:51,390
Ah, that might be true but
the increase in temperature

1610
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:54,000
is also costing you on the recovery side.

1611
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,150
And unless you're doing other things

1612
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,730
to improve your recovery and
I know many people that are,

1613
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,930
I don't judge but many people
who are doing those things

1614
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,380
are also augmenting their recovery

1615
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,880
through hormone augmentation

1616
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,380
and other performance enhancing tools,

1617
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,730
then for the typical
person who's not doing that

1618
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:11,740
it's probably shooting
yourself in the foot.

1619
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,120
So let's take a look at what
some of those compounds are

1620
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,660
and what they and just briefly review

1621
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:19,420
whether or not they would be a
good or a bad idea to include

1622
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,680
if your main goals are performance

1623
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,610
or your main goals are
body recomposition or both.

1624
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:26,630
So let's just briefly discuss stimulants.

1625
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:27,660
This could be caffeine,

1626
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,260
this could be any other kind of stimulant

1627
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:33,270
that are typically in a pre-workout drink

1628
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,400
or anything that might get you
revved up before exercising.

1629
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,150
This could even be very strong tea,

1630
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:40,200
I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.

1631
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,340
I like a yerba mate, I love that stuff

1632
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,033
and I also drink caffeine.

1633
01:11:45,033 --> 01:11:46,990
I drink love coffee of various kinds

1634
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,540
mushroom coffee, black
coffee, espresso, et cetera.

1635
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:54,380
I'm a chronic caffeine user,
I don't think I'm an addict

1636
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,040
but I'm a chronic caffeine user.

1637
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,860
Meaning when I drink caffeine

1638
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,050
my heart rate doesn't increase so much

1639
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,680
that it feels like a shock to my system.

1640
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,710
Some people are not caffeine adapted

1641
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,760
or they're very caffeine sensitive.

1642
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,930
Here's the straightforward rule.

1643
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:14,190
Caffeine for somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine very much

1644
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,980
will constrict the blood vessels

1645
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,840
and will increase retention of body heat

1646
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,760
and it's probably a bad
idea before exercise.

1647
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,410
For somebody who's caffeine adapted

1648
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:26,620
and is used to drinking caffeine,

1649
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,640
it won't have that
vasoconstriction effect,

1650
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,210
that's what the data point
too, because I'm adapted to it

1651
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,540
but it will cause vasodilation

1652
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,990
and will allow me to dump body heat.

1653
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:38,430
So for me, I use it before I train

1654
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,840
or do any kind of exercise

1655
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,240
because I tend to do
that early in the day,

1656
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,740
it won't prevent me from sleeping

1657
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,860
and it causes vasodilation.

1658
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,550
And then afterwards I'm aware

1659
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:48,240
that it causes vasoconstriction

1660
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,060
after the caffeine wears off.

1661
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,490
So for somebody who drinks two or three

1662
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:55,380
or more cups of coffee
a day or mate a day,

1663
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,320
so we're talking intake

1664
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,170
of anywhere from a hundred to
400 milligrams of caffeine,

1665
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,820
what you want to do is
you want to make sure

1666
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,150
that you would do that before exercise

1667
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,580
and probably not after exercise,

1668
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,400
not just makes logical sense

1669
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,290
given what we know about
thermal regulation.

1670
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,700
And if you're somebody who
doesn't drink caffeine,

1671
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,660
drinking caffeine before a workout

1672
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,853
is going to be about the worst thing

1673
01:13:17,853 --> 01:13:19,000
that you could possibly do

1674
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,130
because it's going to
increase core body temperature

1675
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,790
through its thermogenic effects

1676
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:25,260
and it's going to constrict
your blood vessels

1677
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,370
and make it even harder to dump heat.

1678
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:31,240
So I don't suggest that
people drink caffeine or not,

1679
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,230
I just suggest that you think about

1680
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,670
whether or not your
caffeine adapted or not,

1681
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,930
and decide whether or not
you want to drink caffeine.

1682
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:41,320
In general, you're going to be
better not drinking any caffeine

1683
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,430
than you are drinking caffeine

1684
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,930
unless you're a heavy
caffeine user or abuser.

1685
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,830
In which case not drinking caffeine

1686
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,430
is going to give you vicious headaches

1687
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,850
and is going to make it
very hard to get motivated

1688
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,120
because you're just not used to it.

1689
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,050
It takes about three weeks
to get used to no caffeine.

1690
01:13:57,050 --> 01:14:00,000
It's brutal, I've done it
before, I've done caffeine fast,

1691
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,380
I don't know that I ever
want to do it again,

1692
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,990
that's how painful it was.

1693
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:04,440
But you get headaches

1694
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,460
because of the effects on
vasodilation and constriction.

1695
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:10,000
If you like caffeine
use in moderate amounts

1696
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,020
and use it before your not after.

1697
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,260
If you don't like caffeine or
you don't use it very often,

1698
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,460
stay away from it
anywhere close to exercise

1699
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,870
before or after for that matter.

1700
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:21,930
One of the more commonly used compounds

1701
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,440
that's sold over the counter

1702
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,270
are non-steroid anti-inflammatories

1703
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:29,030
so things like Tylenol and
Advil and other trade names

1704
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,150
and Neproxin sodium things of that sort,

1705
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:36,110
almost all of those drop body
temperature to some extent.

1706
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,640
And that's why it's often recommended

1707
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,660
that people take them
when they have a fever

1708
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,500
although the whole business

1709
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,330
of dropping body temperature artificially

1710
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,400
when you have a fever is itself
an interesting discussion

1711
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,340
whether or not that's the most
adaptive or best thing to do

1712
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,950
certainly you don't want
fever to go too high,

1713
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,960
can be very dangerous, can kill you

1714
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,190
but artificially dropping body temperature

1715
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:59,570
with these compounds can be tricky.

1716
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:02,810
Now, a number of athletes
especially endurance athletes

1717
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,240
will rely on these non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs

1718
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,290
specifically to keep
body temperature lower

1719
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,580
during long bouts of exertion.

1720
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,610
This is a little bit of
a pharmacologic version

1721
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,440
of dumping heat instead
of using palmer cooling

1722
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,670
or you know, face ice pack cooling,

1723
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:24,150
they're relying on pharmacology

1724
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:26,440
to drop their core body temperature.

1725
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,000
That has certain obvious advantages,

1726
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,040
those advantages should be obvious

1727
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,840
and the reasons for them should be obvious

1728
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,760
based on everything we've
talked about up until now

1729
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,640
lower temperature allows
you to go further harder

1730
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,713
with more intensity.

1731
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:42,500
However, they do have effects on the liver

1732
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,060
and they can also have
effects on the kidneys

1733
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,840
and during long bouts of exercise

1734
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,070
or even short bouts of exercise,

1735
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:51,500
water balance and salt balance
are also going to be vital

1736
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:55,400
to maintain in order to perform well,

1737
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,150
generate the best muscle
contraction, stay mentally alert

1738
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,500
and also to stay alive.

1739
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,240
We will do an episode on
salt electrolytes and water

1740
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,120
and water balance but you
probably want to think carefully

1741
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,350
about whether or not

1742
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:10,500
you want to use non-steroid
anti-inflammatories

1743
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,450
before any training session

1744
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:15,440
just for the performance
augmentation effect

1745
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,320
unless you're working
carefully with a coach

1746
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,490
whether or not you've
done that in practices

1747
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:24,320
and of course, whether or
not you are in a situation

1748
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,900
where monitoring your
body temperature carefully

1749
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:27,870
is going to be important.

1750
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,180
You might ask, well, when would that be?

1751
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:34,150
Well, desert races, summer
training and races, winter rides,

1752
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:36,350
you certainly don't want
to get too cool either.

1753
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:41,290
So alcohol, caffeine and
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

1754
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,950
because of their effects on temperature

1755
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:45,230
will impact performance and recovery

1756
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:47,520
but you want to be cautious
about how you approach them.

1757
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,230
I personally am more a
fan of using caffeine

1758
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:54,060
in moderate doses for the
reasons I described before

1759
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,700
as well to use the cooling of the palms,

1760
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,140
cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right,

1761
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,920
by placing them into a
bucket or into a cool bath

1762
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,230
after training or cooling
the face after training

1763
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:08,900
or sometimes even during training.

1764
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,680
It just seems like
there's more of a margin

1765
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,730
to play with the variables,
to heat up the water

1766
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:17,080
or cool it down a little
bit to include one palm

1767
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,250
or the other palm.

1768
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,900
There's all sorts of good parameter space

1769
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,700
as we call it in science
that you can play with

1770
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,840
and work with to find what works for you

1771
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,570
whereas when you pop a pill,
sure you can adjust the dose

1772
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,030
and you can adjust it next time

1773
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:32,440
but once it's in you, it's in you

1774
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,110
and there's going to
be some period of time

1775
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:35,950
before you can modulate it.

1776
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,720
What I've offered today

1777
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,970
are ways in which you can use temperature

1778
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:42,760
to powerfully improve performance.

1779
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,630
And if you think about it,

1780
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,410
you can vary that from set to set,

1781
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,020
you could do your pull ups or your sprints

1782
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,750
and then cool your palms,

1783
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,710
and then try and go with
colder water the next round

1784
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,380
or warmer water the next round

1785
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,420
or do both feet and palms and face.

1786
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:58,630
I mean, you can do all sorts
of things moment to moment

1787
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,800
and see what works for you again

1788
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,920
essentially zero cost or no cost.

1789
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,280
Whereas when you pop
something, you take a pill,

1790
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,410
you're basically in that regimen

1791
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:10,510
for the next hour or two or more.

1792
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:13,020
You can always take more, but
you can't really take less.

1793
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,200
You can't really extract it
from your body in real time

1794
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,120
so it doesn't give you
a lot of opportunity

1795
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,690
to play scientists, which
is what I like to do

1796
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,220
because what I'm always trying to do

1797
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,970
is trying to dial in the
best protocols possible

1798
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,570
based on the mechanisms and data.

1799
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:26,960
And if you can do that moment to moment

1800
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,260
that places you in a position of power.

1801
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,920
Once again, we covered a lot of material.

1802
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,020
By now, after seeing this episode

1803
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:37,210
or listening to this episode,
you should understand a lot

1804
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:39,960
about how your body heats and cools itself

1805
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,270
and the value of that
for physical performance.

1806
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:44,520
I hope you'll also appreciate

1807
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,460
that you have tools at your disposal

1808
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,520
to vastly improve your
physical performance.

1809
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,230
And should you try those,
please let us know how it goes.

1810
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,700
If you decide to do palmer
cooling during your runs

1811
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,780
or after your runs, during
your weight workouts,

1812
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:01,290
during your yoga sessions,
whatever it is, let us know,

1813
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,420
please place that in the comments.

1814
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:06,810
I've given you specific
protocols and some direction,

1815
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,000
but I've also left it slightly vague

1816
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,030
because it, as I mentioned earlier

1817
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:12,800
I don't know all the
environmental conditions,

1818
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,850
I don't know how hot your yoga studio is

1819
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,550
or how cool your gym happens to be

1820
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:19,380
or your body temperature or time of day.

1821
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,120
Remember your temperature will vary

1822
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,270
according to the time of day,

1823
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:24,740
we did a whole episode
about that related to sleep.

1824
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,840
Typically your body temperature
is rising early in the day

1825
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,850
and is coming down as you
approach the late evening

1826
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,150
and late night hours for sleep,
in the middle of the night

1827
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,760
your temperature is very low

1828
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,770
at its absolute lowest

1829
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,460
something we call the temperature minimum.

1830
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,130
So we don't know exactly where you're at.

1831
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,890
You need to take the information
that you receive today

1832
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:45,130
and should you try and incorporate it

1833
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,420
try and do it intelligently.

1834
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:49,710
Don't cool yourself off
so much that you know

1835
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:52,550
become cryogenic and please
don't warm yourself up.

1836
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:55,560
In fact, we didn't talk at
all about warming yourself up

1837
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,030
because warming yourself up too
much can be quite dangerous.

1838
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,550
You never, ever, ever
want to be hypothermic,

1839
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,800
that's what your body and your
brain are trying to avoid.

1840
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,720
We talked a little bit about supplements

1841
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,590
but not the standard sorts of supplements

1842
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:11,570
I usually list off on these episodes.

1843
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,050
Rather, we talked about caffeine,

1844
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,900
non-steroid anti-inflammatories

1845
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,190
and how those can impact temperature,

1846
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:19,097
how alcohol can impact temperature.

1847
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:21,120
And I should just mention in closing

1848
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,410
that every time we eat, we
also increased temperature.

1849
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:26,020
There's a eating induced
thermogenic effect

1850
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,900
but that's a minor one,
that's a small one.

1851
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,770
So you wouldn't worry about
eating before training

1852
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,260
because of its effects on temperature

1853
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:36,010
because it tends to be really minor.

1854
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:38,470
Going forward, we're going to
talk more about temperature

1855
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:41,830
and other ways to improve
physical performance

1856
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,680
and skill learning.

1857
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,660
We're going to talk about specific ways

1858
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:48,780
to accelerate fat loss,
to improve muscle growth,

1859
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:52,420
to improve suppleness and flexibility.

1860
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:56,590
These approaches and
mechanisms are anchored deeply

1861
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:59,340
in neuroscience and physiology
and the relationship

1862
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:02,620
between our peripheral
organs, which include our skin

1863
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,670
and our brain and all
the organs in between.

1864
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,730
So it's really a pleasure for
me because I'm able to look

1865
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,120
to the textbook literature that exists

1866
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,450
and really came out over the
last 50 to a hundred years

1867
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,420
and unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience

1868
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,370
which are still sort of mystical,

1869
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:20,220
like consciousness and dreaming,

1870
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,410
of which we understand a little bit

1871
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,620
about these core mechanisms
of temperature and physiology

1872
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:29,110
which are so powerful,
involve very concrete studies

1873
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,763
that as you learn today
are very actionable.

1874

We come out with new episodes every Monday

1883
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:56,330
but from time to time, we
also release shorter content

1884
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:58,610
and we will be releasing
additional content

1885
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,510
in between episodes from time to time.

1886
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:04,120
If you don't already subscribe
on Apple and or Spotify,

1887

Also on Apple, you have
the opportunity to leave us

1889
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:08,760
up to a five star review

1890
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,920
if you think that we
deserve a five star review

1891
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,610
and to leave us feedback.

1892
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:14,120
They have a comment section there,

1893
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,470
it's really a feedback section

1894
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,980
where you can rate and
describe the podcast

1895
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,620
as you experience it.

1896
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:22,600
If you'd like to support
the podcast in other ways,

1897
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,900
please check out our sponsors.

1898
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,390
That's a terrific way to support us.

1899
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:27,430
We also have a Patreon, you can find it

1900
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:30,760
at patreon.com/andrewhuberman

1901
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,600
that allows you to support the podcast

1902
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,680
at any level that you like.

1903
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,730
Today we didn't focus so
heavily on supplements,

1904
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:38,310
but in other episodes I have,

1905
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,160
and there are certainly supplements

1906
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,790
that are beneficial for sleep,

1907
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,040
for performance, for learning,

1908
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,890
immunity and so forth.

1909
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:50,890
We've partnered with
Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com,

1910
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:52,930
because Thorne supplements

1911
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,950
we believe to be the most stringent

1912
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,870
in terms of what they put on the bottle

1913
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:00,340
is actually what's in the bottle,
so the amounts are precise

1914
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,570
and the quality of the
ingredients is very precise.

1915
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,170
They partner with the Mayo Clinic,

1916
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,360
all the major sports teams

1917
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,180
so we're delighted that
we're partnered with Thorne.

1918
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,120
If you want to see the
supplements that I take

1919
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:13,880
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman

1920
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,500
and you can see the
supplements that I take,

1921
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,180
you could get 20% off
any of those supplements

1922
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,450
should you choose to order them

1923
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,910
as well as 20% off any other supplements

1924
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,540
that Thorne happens to make.

1925
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,540
That's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman

1926
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:33,260
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

1927
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,480
And last but not least,

1928
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,860
I want to thank you for
your time and attention.

1929
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,990
I realize this is a lot of information,

1930
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:40,710
I hope you'll find some
of it to be actionable

1931
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:43,130
and useful for you and
for people that you know

1932
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:46,011
and as always thank you for
your interest in science.

1933
01:23:46,011 --> 01:23:48,594
