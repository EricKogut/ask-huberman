00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,900
- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,890
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,096
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:09,150
[bright music]

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,170
I'm Andrew Huberman

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,170
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,060
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,010
Today we're talking all about sleep

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,320
and how to optimize your sleep.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,230
This is a topic we've covered
previously on this podcast

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
in the episode called "Master Your Sleep."

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,030
However, since the airing of that episode,

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,520
there's been some terrific
new science to come out.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,140
I've also received thousands,

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,330
yes, literally thousands of questions

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,480
related to the specific
protocols covered in that episode

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,900
as well as in the episode
on jet lag and shift work.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,890
And while today's episode

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,440
is not specifically about
jet lag and shift work,

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,760
we are going to cover tools

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,890
that will allow you to shift your schedule

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,140
if you need to for work or travel,

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,300
and we will also cover tools

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,160
that will allow you to fall back asleep

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,200
if you happen to wake up
in the middle of the night

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,610
or if you get a poor night's sleep,

27
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,540
how to actually recover

28
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,760
from that poor night's sleep more quickly,

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,060
and yes, indeed, even replace
sleep that you've lost.

30
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,400
So today's episode is going to be filled

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,540
with practical tools.

32
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,790
We will touch on some of
the underlying science,

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,430
but it's really designed
to be a practical toolkit

34
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,020
for optimizing your sleep

35
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,120
depending on your specific sleep needs.

36
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,070
Various times throughout today's episode,

37
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,100
I will refer to studies that
form the backbone of the tools

38
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,420
that I'll be describing.

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,480
But whereas most of the
podcast episodes here

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,570
tend to be deep scientific
mechanism and then tools,

41
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,860
scientific mechanism, then tools,

42
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,220
today I'm mainly going to
focus on the practical tools

43
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,160
that anyone, indeed, all
people, I believe, should use

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,870
in order to optimize their sleep.

45
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,240
Why should everybody want
to optimize their sleep

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,480
and put considerable effort
into optimizing their sleep?

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,300
Well, put simply, sleep is the foundation

48
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,190
of mental health, physical health,

49
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,450
and performance of all kinds,

50
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,970
cognitive performance, physical
performance, et cetera.

51
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,700
It also controls things
like our immune system,

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,330
wound healing, our skin
health and our appearance,

53
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,790
whether or not we can
think clearly or not,

54
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,740
whether or not we will live as long

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,900
as we possibly can or not,

56
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,220
whether or not we suffer

57
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,880
from dramatic age-related
cognitive decline or not.

58
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,910
In other words, whether or not
we keep our memory as we age.

59
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,780
I could go on and on

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,660
about all the terrible things
that can happen to somebody

61
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,550
if they don't sleep well.

62
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,610
Thanks to the great work
of Professor Matt Walker

63
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,110
at University of California, Berkeley,

64
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,720
and the wonderful book that
he wrote, "Why We Sleep,"

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,000
I think the world is largely onboard now

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,280
that sleep is critical to our health,

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,980
our mental health, our physical
health, and our performance,

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,790
but what's not often discussed
is how great life is,

69
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,040
that is, how much more
focused and energetic

70
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,840
and how positive our mood gets,

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
when we are sleeping for the
appropriate amount of time

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,340
at the appropriate depth

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,260
and when we are doing that regularly.

74
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,940
Basically everything in life gets better

75
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,780
when we're sleeping well.

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,730
So today I'm going to teach you the tools

77
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,280
that will allow you to
optimize your sleep.

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
That is, get to sleep and stay asleep,

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,350
fall back asleep if you wake
up in the middle of the night,

80
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,460
and adjust your sleep

81
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,160
given the various life demands
you may be experiencing.

82
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,050
I'm pleased to announce that
The Huberman Lab Podcast

83
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,360
is now partnered with
Momentous supplements.

84
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,610
We partnered with Momentous
for several important reasons.

85
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,290
First of all, they ship internationally,

86
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,210
because we know that
many of you are located

87
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,980
outside of the United States.

88
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,060
That's valuable.

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,070
Second of all, and perhaps most important,

90
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,620
the quality of their
supplements is second to none,

91
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,670
both in terms of purity

92
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,250
and precision of the
amounts of the ingredients.

93
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,890
Third, we've really emphasized supplements

94
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,930
that are single-ingredient supplements

95
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,150
and that are supplied in dosages

96
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,120
that allow you to build a
supplementation protocol

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,950
that's optimized for cost,

98
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,810
that's optimized for effectiveness,

99
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,340
and that you can add things

100
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,960
and remove things from your protocol

101
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,000
in a way that's really
systematic and scientific.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,350
This is really hard to do

103
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,210
if you're taking blends
of different supplements

104
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,780
or if the dosages are such
that you can't titrate,

105
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,330
or that is, adjust the
dosages of a given supplement.

106
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,970
So by using single-ingredient supplements,

107
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,620
you can really build
out the supplement kit

108
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,740
that's ideal for you
and your specific needs.

109
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,910
If you'd like to see the supplements

110
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,230
that we partner with Momentous on,

111
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,320
you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.

112
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,460
There you'll see those supplements.

113
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,950
And just keep in mind that
we are constantly expanding

114
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,620
the library of supplements
available through Momentous

115
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,580
on a regular basis.

116
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,250
Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.

117
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,110
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

118
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,459
that this podcast is separate

119
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,649
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

120
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,719
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

121
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,550
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

122
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,380
about science and science-related tools

123
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,760
to the general public.

124
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,810
In keeping with that theme,

125
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,600
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

126
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,940
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

127
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,370
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

128
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,010
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

129
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,380
to help you better meet your health goals.

130
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,810
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

131
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,210
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

132
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,250
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

133
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,620
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

134
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,170
And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA test,

135
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,250
you can also get insight

136
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,440
into, for instance, what
your biological age is

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
and compare that to
your chronological age.

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,100
And, of course, your biological age

139
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,350
is really the age that counts.

140
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,460
The problem with a lot of blood tests

141
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,230
and DNA tests out there, however,

142
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,790
is that you get information back

143
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,350
about the levels of metabolic factors,

144
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,940
lipids, hormones, et cetera,

145
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,770
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

146
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,320
InsideTracker makes that
all very easy to navigate.

147
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
They have a personalized platform.

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,520
So this is a web portal where you can go,

149
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,010
you'll see the numbers from
your blood tests and DNA tests,

150
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,420
and then it will tell you, for instance,

151
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,760
how you could adjust various
aspects of your nutrition

152
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,710
or your exercise or supplementation

153
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,180
in order to bring those numbers

154
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,400
into the ranges that are best for you.

155
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,780
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

156
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,630

159
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,340
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.

160
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,190
Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

161
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,370
with cooling, heating, and
sleep tracking capabilities.

162
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,770
It turns out that your body temperature

163
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,720
and your ability to fall and stay asleep

164
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,790
are very closely related.

165
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,670
If your body does not drop
by one to three degrees,

166
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,590
you are simply not going
to get into deep sleep

167
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,150
or stay in deep sleep.

168
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,490
And waking up, it also turns out,

169
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,810
is related to body temperature.

170
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,460
Every time you wake up in the morning,

171
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,010
your body is warming up
in order to wake you up,

172
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,590
and this has an enormous number
of hormonal and metabolic

173
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,420
and other cascades that
are vitally important,

174
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,280
not just to what happens while you sleep,

175
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,627
but your health and your energy

176
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:17,640
and focus throughout the day.

177
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,650
Eight Sleep is an incredible device.

178
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,410
It's one that I've been
using for six months or so,

179
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,847
and it's completely transformed my sleep.

180
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:26,370
And I already thought I
was sleeping pretty well.

181
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,580
The way it works is that you
can cool or heat your mattress

182
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,490
according to different
times throughout the night.

183
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,140
So for instance, you
can cool your mattress

184
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,460
if you tend to run warm

185
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,500
and that will help you
fall and stay deeply asleep

186
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,580
and then toward morning,

187
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,440
you can have the mattress programmed

188
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
or, I should say, the
mattress cover programmed,

189
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,550
so that you warm up your
sleeping environment

190
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,680
and you wake up when you want to wake up.

191
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
If you've been sleeping pretty well

192
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,470
but waking up in the middle of the night,

193
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,460
you might also find

194
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,530
that by cooling your mattress even further

195
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,240
toward the middle of your sleep about,

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,060
well, you'll stay in
deep sleep much longer.

197
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,290

Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.

206
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,210
LMNT is an electrolyte drink
that has everything you need

207
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,000
in order to get your brain and
body to function at its best,

208
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,140
but none of the things you don't,

209
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,820
in particular, sugar.

210
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,410
Electrolytes are vitally important

211
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,660
to the way that your neurons,
your nerve cells, work

212
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,620
and, indeed, to the way

213
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,600
that all the cells of your body work.

214
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,040
But your nervous system and your neurons

215
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,320
particularly depend on electrolytes

216
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,210
because you need the electrolytes,

217
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,160
sodium, magnesium, and potassium,

218
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
in the proper ratios,

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,410
in order for those nerve cells

220
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,270
to fire what are called action potentials,

221
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,920
which are the electrical signals

222
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,180
that allow your neurons to work

223
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,440
and to allow you to do everything

224
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,880
from remembering information

225
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,490
to moving your muscles deliberately.

226
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,950
When you exercise, or even if you don't,

227
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,750
you can get quite low on electrolytes,

228
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,770
especially on a hot day.

229
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,120
You can get dehydrated.

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,650
There are lot of different ways

231
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,810
to replenish your fluids and electrolytes

232
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,643
and there are a lot of different

233
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,090
electrolyte drinks out there,

234
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,100
but many of them contain a lot of sugar.

235
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,740
And some of those that
don't contain a lot of sugar

236
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,090
don't have the proper ratios

237
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,830
of sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

238
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,910
If you'd like to try LMNT,

244
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,573
Let's talk about sleep and
tools to optimize your sleep.

245
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,380
I want you to conceptualize yourself

246
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,350
as contained within a room

247
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,330
that has only very few windows
or very few entry points.

248
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,163
What do I mean by this?

249
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:44,070
Well, your brain and your
nervous system control

250
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,930
whether or not you move or don't move.

251
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,820
They control whether or
not you're digesting food

252
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,890
or you're not digesting food.

253
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,690
They control whether or not
you're stressed or not stressed,

254
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,550
happy or sad, et cetera.

255
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,030
All of that stuff that
controls all that stuff

256
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,780
is housed inside your
skin and skull, et cetera.

257
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,520
That might seem pretty obvious,

258
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,480
but what that means is that
for your brain and body

259
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,660
to feel alert and focused,

260
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,960
ready to move and
exercise or do some work,

261
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,310
or if your brain body are going
to lie down and go to sleep,

262
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,290
well, that brain and body
needs cues, it needs inputs,

263
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,770
to determine when to do
those different things.

264
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,170
And those cues and inputs arrive

265
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,080
through a defined set of
what I'll call stimuli,

266
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,869
but you can also think of
these as levers or tools.

267
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:37,260
The main levers and tools
that are going to allow you

268
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,590
to control when you are
awake and when you are asleep

269
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,530
and to get better sleep every single night

270
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,060
are light, literally
photons, light energy,

271
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,980
could be from sunlight, could
be from artificial light,

272
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,920
we will discuss those
particulars in a moment,

273
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,110
as well as darkness.

274
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,840
That is the absence of light.

275
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,340
So we've got light and dark.

276
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,220
Those are two very powerful tools

277
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,600
to encourage your nervous system

278
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,130
to be in one state or another,

279
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,393
meaning awake or asleep.

280
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,040
Temperature is another tool or lever.

281
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,250
Turns out that when your
body is cooling down,

282
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,090
you have a greater tendency
to fall and stay asleep.

283
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,150
In fact, every night
when you actually sleep,

284
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,520
your body is dropping
by one to three degrees

285
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,580
and that drop in temperature is required.

286
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,130
It's like a gate that your
body has to go through

287
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,740
in order for you to get into sleep.

288
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,690
And in fact, the converse is also true.

289
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,050
If your body heats up by
one to three degrees or so,

290
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,460
you will wake up.

291
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,460
So you've got light,
dark, temperature, food.

292
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,210
And when we say food,

293
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,810
we mean what we eat, when we eat,

294
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,120
and the amount that we eat.

295
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Okay, so light, dark,
temperature, food, exercise.

296
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,700
And of course, exercise
comes in different forms.

297
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,350
We can do cardiovascular exercise

298
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,890
that can be low-intensity,
long-distance exercise.

299
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,450
It can be high intensity,

300
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,460
so-called high intensity
interval training.

301
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,560
It could be weight
training. It could be yoga.

302
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,870
It could be swimming, any
number of different activities.

303
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,270
But exercise, in general, causes

304
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,760
an increase in body temperature

305
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,280
and tends to make us more alert,

306
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,810
not just during the exercise,

307
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,870
but in the immediate
hours after that exercise.

308
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,160
Exercise does some other things

309
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,390
that relate to our sleep as well

310
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,680
and we'll talk about those today

311
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,090
and how you can leverage them.

312
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,680
Another potent lever

313
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
for adjusting your sleepiness
and wakefulness is caffeine.

314
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,360
This, of course, comes
as no surprise to people,

315
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,800
but why and how caffeine works
might come as a surprise.

316
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,830
Very briefly, we have a molecule

317
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,390
in our body called adenosine

318
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,490
and the longer we have been awake,

319
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,800
the more adenosine builds
up in our brain and body

320
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,740
and adenosine is part of the
reason why we get sleepy.

321
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Caffeine effectively operates
as a adenosine antagonist.

322
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,560
It works by basically occupying
the receptor for adenosine.

323
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,840
So it's a little bit of
a convoluted mechanism.

324
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,550
But basically all you need to know

325
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,670
is that caffeine prevents
the actions of adenosine.

326
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,520
That's one of the reasons why
caffeine makes us feel alert.

327
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,900
But how much caffeine we drink

328
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,390
and when we drink caffeine turns
out to be vitally important

329
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,490
for adjusting our wakefulness

330
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,810
and for optimizing our sleep.

331
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,100
So we'll talk about that as well.

332
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,810
The other category of lever or tools

333
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,990
which are immensely powerful
for optimizing sleep

334
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,790
are supplements.

335
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,910
There now exist as many as
eight different supplements

336
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,390
that can powerfully modulate
sleep in healthy ways

337
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,850
and that have huge margins for safety.

338
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,340
So we're going to talk about
what those supplements are.

339
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,170
In previous episodes of this podcast

340
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,450
and as a guest on other podcasts,

341
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,430
I've talked about three
particular supplements,

342
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,540
magnesium threonate,
apigenin, and theanine,

343
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,220
which together can really enhance

344
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,290
the speed at which one falls asleep

345
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,360
and people's ability to stay asleep

346
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,373
and to really get into
those deep stages of sleep

347
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:58,200
that are particularly restorative.

348
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,820
Today we're going to
talk a little bit more

349
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,870
about each of those three

350
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,240
and how they can best
be used in combination,

351
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,880
but we are also going to touch
on some other supplements

352
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,150
that I have not talked about
much before, if at all.

353
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,170
Things like glycine and
GABA, as well as inositol.

354
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,690
Many people are going to
find inositol interesting

355
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,180
and of particular use to them,

356
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,880
especially if they're following
a low-carbohydrate diet

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,480
or if they are fasting before sleep

358
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,430
or just trying to avoid
eating too close to bedtime

359
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,190
and yet they're having a
hard time falling asleep.

360
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,560
Inositol also turns out
to be especially useful

361
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,610
for people who have a tendency

362
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,470
to wake up in the middle of the night

363
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,200
and have a hard time falling back asleep.

364
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,850
It also has some interesting
and potent effects

365
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,200
on anxiety throughout the day.

366
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,590
So we're going to talk about
inositol as a tool as well.

367
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,720
And then last in our list
of general categories

368
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,360
of levers and tools for optimizing sleep

369
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,327
are digital tools.

370
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,270
Now, when we say digital tools,

371
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,710
I don't necessarily mean devices.

372
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,220
What I mean are things like
non-sleep deep rest scripts.

373
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,220
These are zero-cost
scripts that you listen to

374
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,350
that take your body through
some deep relaxation

375
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,010
and that can help people both
fall asleep, stay asleep,

376
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,890
fall back asleep, and
get better at sleeping.

377
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,380
And also going to talk about digital tools

378
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,820
related to self-hypnosis.

379
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,220
This is distinctly different
from stage hypnosis.

380
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,080
So I know some of you hear
hypnosis and you think,

381
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,960
oh, you know, people
clucking like chickens

382
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,030
and doing things that are
outside their control.

383
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,650
That's not at all what
I'm referring to here.

384
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,670
I'm talking about clinically
and research-supported tools

385
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,550
that have been shown to
enhance people's ability

386
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,780
to fall and stay asleep

387
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,170
and that can get you
far better at sleeping.

388
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,930
So again, to recap the
list of levers and tools,

389
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,787
we've got light and dark,

390
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,530
and that includes the intensity of light,

391
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,700
the timing of light, et cetera.

392
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
We've got temperature.

393
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,010
We have food.

394
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:49,010
We have exercise, caffeine,
supplements, and digital tools,

395
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,700
not just limited to devices,

396
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,210
but zero-cost tools that
you can access on YouTube

397
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,830
and elsewhere in various apps

398
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,630
that can really help
you optimize your sleep.

399
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,250
So today we're going to
talk about all of these.

400
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,710
I really want to provide you
as many tools as possible,

401
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,450
give you the logic behind
each of those tools

402
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,640
and when and how best to apply them

403
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,520
so that you can develop the sleep toolkit

404
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,650
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

405
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,240
As we head into our description

406
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,550
of tools for optimizing sleep,

407
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,390
let's consider what the
perfect 24-hour cycle

408
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,920
would look like.

409
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,570
Let's start this 24-hour cycle

410
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,340
with when you wake up in the morning.

411
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,350
So for some of you, that will be 5:00 a.m.

412
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,360
For others of you, that will be 10:00 a.m.

413
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,620
Most people, I believe, wake up

414
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,700
sometime between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m.

415
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,310
But regardless of when you
wake up in the morning,

416
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,930
one of the first things that happens

417
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,780
is that your body
temperature is increasing

418
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,790
and that's just going to happen naturally.

419
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,410
Some of it is going to be the consequence

420
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,000
of your moving around a bit,

421
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,460
but really the increase
in body temperature

422
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,050
is one of the main triggers

423
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,183
for why you woke up in the first place.

424
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,250
That increase in body temperature
in turn causes an increase

425
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,980
in the release of a
hormone called cortisol.

426
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,890
Cortisol is often discussed
as a stress hormone,

427
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,900
but it's not just associated with stress.

428
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,510
It also enhances your immune system

429
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,780
provided cortisol is
elevated at the right times,

430
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,700
and the right time for
cortisol to be elevated

431
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,953
is when you first wake up in the morning.

432
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,960
That increase in cortisol

433
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,930
is also going to increase metabolism.

434
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,500
It's also going to increase
your ability to focus mentally

435
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,750
and for you to move your body.

436
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,870
So again, cortisol is often demonized

437
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,130
and consider this bad thing.

438
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,750
And indeed, you don't want cortisol

439
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,210
to be chronically or consistently elevated

440
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,710
throughout the day or night.

441
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,400
But you do want cortisol to
reach its peak early in the day

442
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,860
right about the time you wake up.

443
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,510
One way that you can ensure

444
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,030
that that cortisol peak
occurs early in the day

445
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,100
right about the time that you wake up

446
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,790
is to view bright light,
ideally from sunlight,

447
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,303
within the first 30 to
60 minutes after waking.

448
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,810
That's right, view bright sunlight

449
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,860
within the first 30 to
60 minutes after waking.

450
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,270
I'll get into all the caveats

451
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,520
about what happens if you
wake up before the sun is out,

452
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,440
what if you live in the
UK where there is no sun,

453
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,609
or people claim there is no sun.

454
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,781
Hate to tell you this, folks,
but there is sun in the UK.

455
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,289
We'll talk about all that.

456
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,280
But everybody, whether or not
you live in a cloudy place

457
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,390
or a sunny place,

458
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,970
whether or not there's
cloud cover or not that day,

459
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,089
should really strive to get
bright light in your eyes,

460
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,499
ideally from sunlight,

461
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,160
within the first 30 to
60 minutes after waking.

462
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,590
The reason for that is very simple.

463
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,660
You want to trigger that cortisol increase

464
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,050
to occur very early in your day,

465
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,540
and you don't want that
cortisol peak to happen later,

466
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,740
which is what will happen

467
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,623
if you wait to get
outside and see sunlight.

468
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,990
The reason for this

469
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,350
is that you have a set of
neurons, nerve cells, in your eye.

470
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,910
They're called
intrinsically photosensitive

471
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,743
melanopsin cells,

472
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,550
but you do not need to know that name.

473
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,430
Those neurons respond
best to bright light,

474
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,730
and especially right after
waking early in the day,

475
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,760
they are best able to
signal to a set of neurons

476
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,710
that reside over the roof of your mouth

477
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,180
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

478
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,170
which is a cluster of neurons

479
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,050
that then sends a huge
number of other signals,

480
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,040
electrical and chemical,

481
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,540
out to your entire body

482
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,970
that triggers that cortisol increase,

483
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,980
provides a wake-up signal
for your brain and body,

484
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,320
and sets in motion a timer

485
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,450
for you to fall asleep later that night.

486
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,920
So again, we're not trying to go into

487
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,000
too much mechanism today.

488
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,830
We are trying to really hammer on tools

489
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,690
and I'll substantiate those tools

490
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,550
just a bit with some mechanism.

491
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,890
But here's what you do, or
at least here's what I do.

492
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,896
I wake up in the morning and
I want to reach for my phone,

493
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,590
but I know that even if I were
to crank up the brightness

494
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,820
on that phone screen,

495
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,120
it's not bright enough to
trigger that cortisol spike

496
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,930
and for me to be at my
most alert and focused

497
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,763
throughout the day

498
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:48,000
and to optimize my sleep at night.

499
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,870
So what I do is I get out
of bed and I go outside.

500
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,200
And if it's a bright, clear day

501
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,030
and the sun is low in the sky

502
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,040
or the sun is, you know,
starting to get overhead,

503
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,570
what we call low solar angle,

504
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,633
then I know I'm getting
outside at the right time.

505
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,160
If there's cloud cover
and I can't see the sun,

506
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,750
I also know I'm doing a good thing

507
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,940
because it turns out,
especially on cloudy days,

508
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,780
you want to get outside

509
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,780
and get as much light energy
or photons in your eyes.

510
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,670
But let's say it's a very clear day

511
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,830
and I can see where the sun is.

512
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,590
I do not need to stare
directly into the sun.

513
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,590
If it's very low in the
sky, I might do that

514
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,900
because it's not going to
be very painful to my eyes.

515
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,043
However, if the sun is
a little bit brighter

516
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,890
and a little bit higher in the sky,

517
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,570
sometimes it could be painful to look at.

518
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,290
So the way to get this sunlight
viewing early in the day

519
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,990
is to look toward the sun.

520
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,330
If it's too bright to look at directly,

521
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,290
well, then don't do that.

522
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,570
You just look toward it,
but not directly at it.

523
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,730
It's absolutely fine to blink.

524
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,020
In fact, I encourage you to blink

525
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,450
whenever you feel the impulse to blink.

526
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,240
Never look at any light,
sunlight or otherwise,

527
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,860
that's so bright that
it's painful to look at

528
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,510
'cause you can damage your eyes.

529
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,850
But for this morning sunlight viewing,

530
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,890
it's best to not wear sunglasses,

531
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,260
that's right, to not wear sunglasses,

532
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,990
at least for this
morning sunlight viewing.

533
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,640
It is absolutely fine to wear
eyeglasses or contact lenses,

534
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,750
so-called corrective lenses.

535
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,850
In fact, those will serve you well

536
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,440
in this practice or this tool

537
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,600
because they will focus the
light onto your neural retina

538
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,590
and onto those melanopsin

539
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,750
intrinsically photosensitive
ganglion cells.

540
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,000
If your eyeglasses or contact lenses

541
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,300
have UV protection, that's okay.

542
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,740
There's so many different
wavelengths of light

543
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,330
coming from the sun

544
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,410
and they are bright enough

545
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,120
that they will trigger the mechanisms

546
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,900
that you want triggered
at this early time of day.

547
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,580
So try and get outside,

548
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,440
ideally within the first
five minutes of waking

549
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,240
or maybe it's 15 minutes,

550
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,790
but certainly within the
first hour after waking.

551
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,950
I want to share with you
three critical things

552
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,260
about this tool of
morning sunlight viewing.

553
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,040
First of all, this is not
some woo biology thing.

554
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,980
This is grounded in the
core of our physiology.

555
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,110
There are literally
hundreds, if not thousands,

556
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,550
of quality peer-reviewed papers

557
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,030
showing that light
viewing early in the day

558
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,740
is the most powerful stimulus

559
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,240
for wakefulness throughout the day

560
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,850
and it has a powerful, positive impact

561
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,950
on your ability to fall
and stay asleep at night.

562
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,920
So this is really the
foundational power tool

563
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,530
for ensuring a great night's sleep

564
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,080
and for feeling more awake during the day.

565
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,613
Second of all, if you wake
up before the sun is out,

566
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,350
you can, and probably should,
flip on artificial lights

567
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,750
in your internal home
environment or apartment

568
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,130
or wherever you happen to live

569
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,020
if your goal is to be awake, right?

570
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,100
If you wake up at four in the morning

571
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,000
and you need to be awake,

572
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,490
well, then turn on artificial lights.

573
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,410
Once the sun is out, however,

574
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,600
once the sun has risen,

575
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,333
then you still want to get
outside and view sunlight.

576
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Some of you will wake up
before the sun comes out.

577
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,540
And if you're asking whether or not

578
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,710
turning on artificial lights

579
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,780
can replace sunlight at those hours,

580
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,870
unfortunately, the answer is no.

581
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,217
Unless you have a very special light,

582
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,290
and we'll talk about what kind of light,

583
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,320
the bright artificial lights
in your home environment

584
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,190
are not, I repeat, are not
going to be sufficiently bright

585
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,190
to turn on the cortisol mechanism

586
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,720
and the other wake-up mechanisms

587
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,030
that you need early in the day.

588
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,650
The diabolical twist, however,

589
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,410
is that those lights in
your home or apartment

590
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,030
or even on your phone

591
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,580
are bright enough to disrupt your sleep

592
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,310
if you look at them too late at night

593
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,700
or in the middle of the night.

594
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,900
So there's this asymmetry in
our retinal, our eye biology,

595
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,580
and in our brain's biology,

596
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,590
whereby early in the
day, right around waking,

597
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,050
you need a lot of light, a lot of photons,

598
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,190
a lot of light energy,

599
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,400
and artificial lights
generally just won't accomplish

600
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,930
what you need them to accomplish.

601
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,990
But at night, even a little
bit of artificial light

602
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,450
can really mess up your
so-called circadian,

603
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,830
your 24-hour clocks,

604
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,900
and all these mechanisms
that we're talking about.

605
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,020
So if you wake up before the
sun is out and it's still dark,

606
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,660
please turn on as many
bright artificial lights

607
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,760
as you possibly can or need,

608
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,073
but then get outside once the sun is out.

609
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,450
On cloudy days, you especially
need to get outside.

610
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,700
I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,

611
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,770
you especially need to get
outside and get sunlight.

612
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,210
You just need to get more of it.

613
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,480
Now, how much light and how
much light viewing do you need?

614
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,690
This is going to vary
depending on person and place,

615
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,340
literally where you live on earth,

616
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,410
whether or not there's
a lot of tree cover,

617
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,210
whether or not you're somebody
who has sensitive eyes

618
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,470
or less sensitive eyes.

619
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,700
It's really impossible for me

620
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,530
to give an absolute prescriptive,

621
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,240
but we can give some general guidelines.

622
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,220
In general, on a clear day,

623
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,070
meaning no cloud cover
or minimal cloud cover,

624
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,000
you want to get this sunlight
exposure to your eyes

625
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,640
for about five minutes or so.

626
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,720
Could be three minutes one day,

627
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,610
could be seven minutes the next day,

628
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,290
about five minutes.

629
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,600
On a day where there's cloud cover,

630
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
so the sun is just
peeking through the clouds

631
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,680
or it's more dense cloud cover,

632
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,220
you want to get about 10
minutes of sunlight exposure

633
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,660
to your eyes early in the day.

634
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,150
And on days that are
really densely overcast

635
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,440
or maybe even are rainy,

636
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,620
you're going to want to get
as much as 20 or 30 minutes

637
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,660
of sunlight exposure.

638
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,260
Another key thing is do not, forget about,

639
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,020
just don't try and get
this sunlight exposure

640
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,990
through a windshield of a car or a window,

641
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,400
whether or not it's tinted or otherwise.

642
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,990
It takes far too long.

643
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,080
It's simply not going to
trigger the relevant mechanisms.

644
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,400
You would be standing there all day

645
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,140
trying to get enough light into your eyes

646
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,070
from the morning sunlight

647
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,260
and by then the sun
will have already moved

648
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,270
from low solar angle to overhead

649
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,400
and it simply won't work
for all sorts of mechanisms

650
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,530
related to your circadian
rhythm functions.

651
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,580
So just don't try and do it

652
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,050
through a windshield,
sunglasses, or a window.

653
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:40,980
It's just not going to work.

654
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,000
Get outside.

655
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,380
If the weather is really bad

656
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,910
or for whatever reason, safety reasons,

657
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,020
you cannot get outside,

658
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,850
well, then I suppose try
and get near a window.

659
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,890
That would be the last, last resort.

660
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,840
But you really want to get outside

661
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,730
to get this sunlight exposure.

662
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,830
Now, if you live in a part of the world

663
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,930
where it's extremely dark and overcast

664
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,400
or the weather won't let you outside

665
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,670
or you live in a cave
or some other small box

666
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,070
that does not allow any
natural light into it

667
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,390
for whatever reason,

668
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,030
well, then you're going
to need a replacement

669
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,680
for that sunlight.

670
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,040
And there are sunlight
simulators or daylight simulators

671
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,090
that you can purchase.

672
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,940
Those are quite expensive in general

673
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,060
and therefore I suggest cheaper options

674
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,560
that work just as well

675
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,060
because they get just as bright.

676
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,580
Things like ring lights that are sold

677
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,390
in order for people to take
selfies and this kind of thing.

678
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,300
A drawing LED tablet
will work pretty well.

679
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,133
I actually have one of those

680
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,550
and I put it on my desk all morning

681
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,610
even though I still get
outside and look at sunlight

682
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,570
first thing in the morning,

683
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,590
again, also, especially, I
should say, on cloudy days.

684
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,240
We do not have any affiliation

685
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,020
to any ring lights or LED
lights or these panels.

686
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,690
So we will provide a link to
a couple of different options

687
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,220
if you want to explore
the various options.

688
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,750
I don't know what people's
different budgets are.

689
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,400
I don't know where people live.

690
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,110
I just know that many
of our listeners live

691
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,250
in locations throughout the world

692
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,450
where, for instance, during the winter,

693
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,470
it gets very, very dark,

694
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,270
so they can't get sufficient sunlight.

695
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,230
But get that morning light,
ideally from sunlight,

696
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,050
and take into account
all the specific points

697
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,430
that I've given you here.

698
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,130
And, I should say, enjoy this practice.

699
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,560
It's really nice to get outside
first thing in the morning

700
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,393
and get this sunlight.

701
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:19,710
In fact, when you start doing this,

702
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,570
you'll notice that your body

703
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,060
will start to feel more energized

704
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,550
and it will feel more
energized more quickly.

705
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,690
You'll actually start

706
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,060
to notice this mechanism
kicking in each day,

707
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,309
especially if you're paying
attention to your physiology.

708
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,950
So enjoy this practice of getting outside.

709
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,650
Yes, you can take your
morning beverage outside.

710
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,570
Yes, you can take your dog with you.

711
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,580
In fact, animals intuitively know

712
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,750
to get this morning sunlight.

713
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,850
They actually seek it out
at the right times of days.

714
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,530
We human beings need to be told

715
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,940
by podcasters and other people

716
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,610
about the science that supports
these kinds of practices.

717
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,140
Our pets apparently do not.

718
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,930
But get outside alone or with somebody,

719
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,550
with your kids, with your dog.

720
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,080
However you go about this practice,

721
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,970
make sure you do this practice

722
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,120
at least 80% of the days of your life.

723
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,960
That's right.

724
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,340
If you miss a day,

725
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,070
for instance, you're bedridden for a day,

726
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,774
try and get next to a window.

727
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:11,940
Let's say you are traveling,

728
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,440
or for whatever reason,

729
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,140
you are not able to get outside
first thing in the morning,

730
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,810
well, then try to get twice
as much sunlight in your eyes,

731
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,460
or I should say extend the duration

732
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,050
of sunlight viewing in the morning

733
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,210
for twice as long the following day.

734
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,060
This is a slow, integrative mechanism

735
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,530
that underlies this whole thing

736
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,363
of wakefulness during the day

737
00:27:29,363 --> 00:27:31,680
and sleep at night due to sunlight viewing

738
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,900
and if you miss a day, you can
make up for it the next day,

739
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,240
but you have to get twice as much light

740
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,450
or twice as much duration of light.

741
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,860
If you really want to get technical

742
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,820
and you really want to measure

743
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,200
how much light is in your environment,

744
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,530
you can download a free app,
something like Light Meter,

745
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,940
and that will allow your phone

746
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,650
to act as a bit of a light meter.

747
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,870
It'll give you a pretty
accurate measurement

748
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,600
of how many lux, which is
a measure of brightness,

749
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,520
are in your environment in the morning.

750
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,160
And in general, that's just
going to be a good tool

751
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,730
for evaluating your environments.

752
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,170
Here's what I suggest you do.

753
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,450
Wake up in the morning, take Light Meter,

754
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,310
point it at the brightest
light in your home,

755
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,180
and take a measurement,

756
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,400
and what you'll probably find
is it's about a thousand lux.

757
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,460
Now go outside and if
there's some sunlight out

758
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,480
and there's cloud cover,

759
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,640
point it at the sky and press that button.

760
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,660
You can actually hold it down

761
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,200
and it'll give you a dynamically
updated lux measurement.

762
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,450
And what you'll find
is like 5,000, 10,000,

763
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,460
sometimes even 90,000 lux,

764
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,620
even though you don't experience
it as so much brighter,

765
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,540
and that's because an
indoor artificial light

766
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,810
is very concentrated
over a small spatial area

767
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,670
whereas the sunlight is very diffuse.

768
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,680
But it's that diffuse,
very bright sunlight,

769
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,580
that photon energy,

770
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,413
that you really want

771
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,490
that's going to set all the
rhythms of your brain and body

772
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,530
in the proper way.

773
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,880
Not just that cortisol peak,

774
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,160
but it's going to trigger
proper metabolism,

775
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
it's going to set a timer for you

776
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,270
to be able to fall asleep
about 16 hours later,

777
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,770
and on and on and on.

778
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,810
And I should mention within
the on and on and on,

779
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,660
it's also going to suppress any melatonin,

780
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,740
a hormone that makes you sleepy

781
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,930
that happens to be swimming
around in your bloodstream

782
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,460
at the time you wake up.

783
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,930
It does a number of other things too,

784
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,030
including interact with
the adenosine system

785
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,890
and kind of wash out some of the adenosine

786
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,690
that might still be residual
if you didn't sleep enough.

787
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,901
Fundamentally speaking, get
that morning sunlight viewing.

788
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:18,270
I promise you will be
grateful that you did.

789
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,180
It makes everybody feel
better, feel more alert,

790
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,580
and it will greatly
assist with your ability

791
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,830
to fall and stay asleep later that night.

792
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,570
Before we continue with
today's discussion,

793
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,160
we're going to take a brief pause

794
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,780
to acknowledge our sponsor,

795
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,420
Athletic Greens, also called AG1.

796
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,750
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

797
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,710
So I'm delighted

798
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,140
that they've been a
sponsor of this podcast.

799
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,990
Athletic Greens contains
vitamins, minerals, probiotics,

800
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,690
digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.

801
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,010
So it's got a lot of things in there.

802
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,357
That's actually the
reason I started taking it

803
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:51,330
and the reason I still take
it once or twice a day.

804
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,610
It essentially covers all
of my nutritional bases.

805
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,680
And the probiotics in
particular are important to me

806
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,030
because of the critical importance

807
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,620
of what's called the gut-brain axis,

808
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,860
that is neurons and other
cell types in the gut,

809
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,940
in the digestive tract,

810
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,410
that communicate with the brain

811
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,660
and the brain back to the digestive tract

812
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,000
in order to control things like mood,

813
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,030
immune function, hormone
function, and on and on.

814
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,470
Whenever somebody has asked me

815
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,630
what's the one supplement
they should take,

816
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,280
I always answer Athletic Greens.

817
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,650
I gave that answer long
before I ever had this podcast

818
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,420
and it's the answer I still give now

819
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,210
for all the reasons that I
detailed just a moment ago.

820
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,590
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

821
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,440
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

822
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,580
to claim a special offer.

823
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,990
They'll give you five free travel packs

824
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,730
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

825
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,750
while you're on the road,

826
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,570
plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2,

827
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,590
which are also very important

828
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,890
for a huge number of bodily
factors and brain factors

829
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,810
that impact your immediate
and long-term health.

830
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,420
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

831
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,800
to claim that special offer.

832
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,150
Okay, so now we're still focusing

833
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,190
on this early part of the
day when you've woken up,

834
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,130
the first hour or so after waking.

835
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,880
And we can go to our list of
other levers and tools, right?

836
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,230
We have light and dark.

837
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,560
We already talked about light
and sunlight in particular.

838
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,540
We've got temperature, food, exercise,

839
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,180
caffeine, supplements, and digital tools.

840
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,480
Now, once you've woken up and
you want to be awake, okay?

841
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,700
So this is likely to be early in the day

842
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,220
if you're following a
more standard schedule.

843
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,430
You will also want to
leverage not just light,

844
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,883
but temperature as a tool.

845
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,660
If you are inclined, it would be wise

846
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,510
to try and increase your
core body temperature

847
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,480
a bit more quickly than it would otherwise

848
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,880
if you were to just, you
know, shuffle around outside,

849
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,713
get your sunlight,

850
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:34,980
maybe read a little bit, et cetera,

851
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,720
and there are two main
ways you can do that.

852
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,920
The first way is to get into
cold water of some sort.

853
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,090
So this could be a cold shower

854
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,610
of anywhere from one to three minutes.

855
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,740
This could be an ice bath
if that's your thing.

856
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,210
It could be a cold tub,

857
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,550
or if you own a cold tub

858
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,340
that's specifically designed
for deliberate cold exposure.

859
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,350
Get under some cold water.

860
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,600
That will certainly wake you up.

861
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,490
And if you've ever jumped into cold water

862
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,360
or had a cold shower,

863
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,710
you know it really wakes you up

864
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,950
because you release
adrenaline, epinephrine,

865
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,440
from both your brain and body,

866
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,307
the body from your adrenals

867
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:10,110
and your brain from a
little cluster of neurons

868
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,370
called locus coeruleus.

869
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,870
Again, the names don't matter.

870
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,180
One to three minutes of cold
water exposure will wake you up

871
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,920
because of that adrenaline release

872
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,710
and, and I want to highlight the and,

873
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,490
it will serve to increase
your core body temperature.

874
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,040
That's right, your body and brain interact

875
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,600
as a bit of a thermostat system

876
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,910
where if you put something cold
on the surface of your body,

877
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,710
your brain, a little cluster of neurons

878
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,900
in the so-called medial preoptic area,

879
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,587
act as a thermostat and say,

880
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,640
"Ah, the external of my body is cold

881
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,350
and therefore I'm going to heat up

882
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,460
my core body temperature."

883
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,750
So it's a little bit paradoxical.

884
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,210
People think, oh, if you get
into cold water or an ice bath,

885
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,530
your body temperature is going to drop.

886
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,360
And indeed, that's true if
you stay in for a while,

887
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,340
but if you just get in for
about one to three minutes,

888
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,470
or under the cold shower
for one to three minutes,

889
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,140
your core body temperature will increase.

890
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,420
So then when you get
out of that cold water,

891
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,020
your body temperature is
increasing at a rate, at a slope,

892
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,180
that's steeper than it would otherwise

893
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,380
and you're going to feel more alert.

894
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,340
It also has the advantage

895
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,080
of increasing not just adrenaline,

896
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,910
but dopamine, which is a molecule involved

897
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,380
in motivation, focus, et cetera.

898
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,180
So this is great for waking up.

899
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,290
So we've got sunlight,

900
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,420
we've got temperature
triggered by cold water,

901
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,760
and we have exercise.

902
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,630
One of the best ways

903
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,720
to increase your core body
temperature early in the day

904
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,040
is to do exercise.

905
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,900
Now, some of you might choose

906
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,810
to do your full-blown workout for the day

907
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,250
first thing when you
wake up in the morning,

908
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,930
I would say the best time to exercise,

909
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,700
at least what the research points to,

910
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,130
is immediately when you
wake up in the morning

911
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,910
or three hours after waking
or 11 hours after waking.

912
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,580
But that's really getting
down into optimization

913
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,830
for sake of muscular
strength and grip strength

914
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,370
and it's very hard to give
a strict prescriptive.

915
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,390
Here's what I suggest.

916
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,460
If you want to be alert early in the day

917
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,710
and you want to sleep great at night,

918
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,530
get that bright sunlight,
get into some cold water,

919
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,810
and if you don't want to
get into some cold water,

920
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,190
try and get some movement.

921
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,390
It could be a walk.

922
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,620
So you can get your sunlight exposure

923
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,260
while you're taking a walk
first thing in the morning.

924
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,400
It could be a light jog.

925
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,020
It could be skipping rope.

926
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,540
These days, I skip rope for
about 10 minutes or 20 minutes

927
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,770
while looking at the sun.

928
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,449
So I'm trying to layer
in these different things

929
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,282
for waking up.

930
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:14,940
And then I take a cold shower afterwards.

931
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,080
This is what I've been doing as of lately,

932
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,139
but I don't do that all
year long necessarily.

933
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,259
Or some of you are going to
be working out mid-morning.

934
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,730
I sometimes do that.

935
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,969
But try and get your core
body temperature increased

936
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,169
first thing in the morning,

937
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,139
and a great way to do that
is with the cold water

938
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,359
and/or with exercise.

939
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,730
And again, it doesn't have
to be your full-blown workout

940
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,563
for the day

941
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:37,920
if you're doing workouts consistently,

942
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,000
which I hope everybody is

943
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,159
because everybody really should exercise

944
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,499
at least, I believe, five or six,

945
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,580
or maybe even seven days a week.

946
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,560
For me, it's six days
a week, sometimes five,

947
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,120
rarely is it seven.

948
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,500
So get that exercise

949
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,659
or even just a modest amount of movement,

950
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,729
walking, jogging, skipping rope,

951
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,350
some light calisthenics.

952
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,300
That will further increase
your core body temperature

953
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,890
and help you feel more awake.

954
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,600
Then we have the category of caffeine.

955
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,470
And again, we're just talking

956
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,730
about this early part of the day,

957
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,050
and you might be saying, "Wait a second,

958
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,390
I thought this was an episode
about tools for sleep."

959
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,950
Well, everything that
we're talking about doing

960
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,280
in these first 60 to 90 minutes of the day

961
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,630
really set in motion a
wave of biological cascades

962
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,460
that carry through the entire day

963
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,780
and into the evening and into the night

964
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,820
and really do serve to optimize sleep.

965
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,590
So just hang in there with me.

966
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,670
And for those of you that are interested

967
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,860
in focus and attention,
your ability to learn,

968
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,450
all of these tools and practices

969
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,630
are going to greatly
enhance those as well.

970
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,340
So the next category of tool

971
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,380
for use early in the day is caffeine.

972
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,200
Caffeine is a very important
compound to think about.

973
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,900
I do realize that some people
who are prone to anxiety,

974
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,730
especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks,

975
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,263
might avoid caffeine entirely.

976
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,120
That's absolutely fine.

977
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,800
You do not have to drink caffeine.

978
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,270
So what I'm about to describe

979
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,610
are ways to leverage caffeine use

980
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,920
to optimize sleep and wakefulness

981
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,280
if you are comfortable with
caffeine, if you like caffeine,

982
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,360
I happen to love caffeine.

983
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,030
I like it in the form
of coffee or espresso

984
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,530
or yerba mate tea,

985
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,860
in particular non-smoked
varieties of yerba mate tea.

986
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,440
Non-smoked because the smoked
varieties seem to carry

987
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,690
some carcinogenics, some
cancer causing risk.

988
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,980
There's increasing data on that.

989
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,640
So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate.

990
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
So caffeine is something

991
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,510
that a lot of people
consume early in the day.

992
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,790
How much depends on your tolerance,

993
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,890
and there's a lot of
individual variability here.

994
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,350
Again, caffeine is an
adenosine antagonist,

995
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,720
or effectively works as
an adenosine antagonist

996
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,890
and limits sleepiness.

997
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,210
I highly recommend

998
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,130
that everybody delay their caffeine intake

999
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,770
for 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

1000
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,050
However painful it may
be to eventually arrive

1001
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,870
at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking,

1002
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,270
you want, and I encourage you,

1003
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,580
to clear out whatever residual adenosine

1004
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,050
is circulating in your system

1005
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,270
in that first 90 to
120 minutes of the day.

1006
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,290
Get that sunlight exposure,

1007
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,880
get some movement to wake up,

1008
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,200
and then, and only then,
start to ingest caffeine

1009
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,410
because what you'll do if
you delay caffeine intake

1010
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,020
until 90 to 120 minutes after waking

1011
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,530
is you will avoid the
so-called afternoon crash.

1012
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,840
And you may still get a
little bit of dip in energy

1013
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,673
in the afternoon,

1014
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,540
but it's not going to
be that massive crash.

1015
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,940
I've talked about the
reasons for that crash

1016
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,230
on previous episodes.

1017
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,330
But if you delay your caffeine intake

1018
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,040
90 to 120 minutes after waking,

1019
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,040
you are doing yourself a great
service towards wakefulness

1020
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,390
and to avoid the crash.

1021
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,490
And the afternoon crash has
another liability to it,

1022
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,810
which is typically people will emerge

1023
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,540
from that afternoon crash
either grumpy or groggy

1024
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,420
and then they'll lean into
drinking more caffeine,

1025
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,760
which can then disrupt their sleep.

1026
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,580
So wait 90 to 120 minutes
after waking in the morning

1027
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,810
to drink caffeine.

1028
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,808
And if you drink caffeine at
any point throughout the day,

1029
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:43,230
really try and avoid any caffeine,

1030
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,940
certainly avoid drinking

1031
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,630
more than a hundred milligrams
of caffeine after 4:00 p.m.

1032
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,450
and probably even better to
limit your last caffeine intake

1033
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,610
to 3:00 p.m. or even 2:00 p.m.

1034
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,400
And for many people,
shifting that caffeine intake

1035
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,560
from immediately after
waking in the morning

1036
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,060
to 90 to 120 minutes

1037
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,850
gives them a much longer arc
of energy throughout the day

1038
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,860
and they don't feel the need

1039
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,590
to drink more caffeine
later in the afternoon.

1040
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,840
If you do drink caffeine
later in the afternoon,

1041
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,750
really try and limit the
total amount or drink decaf.

1042
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,910
Certainly keep the total amount

1043
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,260
to less than a hundred milligrams

1044
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,100
if you are interested

1045
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,810
in getting into the best possible sleep.

1046
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,750
And I say this knowing that
many people, including myself,

1047
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,490
can drink a double espresso

1048
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,410
with 200 milligrams of caffeine or more

1049
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,410
at 5:00 p.m. or even
6:00 p.m. or after dinner

1050
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,780
and still, quote,
unquote, fall asleep fine

1051
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,890
or still sleep fine.

1052
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,530
However, there are terrific data,

1053
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,660
Matt Walker and I talked about this,

1054
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,880
and there are more and
more papers all the time

1055
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,930
that point to the fact that
caffeine intake late in the day,

1056
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,310
after 4:00 p.m. that is,

1057
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,650
can really disrupt the
architecture of your sleep.

1058
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,060
So you might think you're sleeping well,

1059
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,920
but you're not sleeping
nearly as well as you could

1060
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,040
if you avoided caffeine
in those afternoon hours.

1061
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,010
Now, some of you might be doing
your main about of exercise

1062
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,000
first thing in the morning

1063
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,730
and you want your caffeine
before that about of exercise.

1064
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,190
In that case, I say, go for it.

1065
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,023
Drink your caffeine,

1066
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:04,800
do your workout right after waking up.

1067
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,660
I don't have a problem with that.

1068
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,650
You will find, however,

1069
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,167
that you're going to get an
early afternoon dip in energy

1070
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:12,840
and that dip in energy is
going to be substantial

1071
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,910
because it's going to be a dip in energy

1072
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,870
that naturally follows that
workout from the morning.

1073
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,270
So it's dependent on temperature,

1074
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,250
and it's going to be related

1075
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,780
to the elimination of that
adenosine blockade by caffeine.

1076
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,900
So you're getting a
kind of a one-two punch

1077
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,890
on your energy levels

1078
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,600
by taking a lot of caffeine and
exercising early in the day.

1079
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,710
You can sort of expect

1080
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,840
that you're going to get a drop in energy

1081
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,160
in the early afternoon.

1082
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,900
That's okay if that works for you,

1083
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,090
but just know that delaying that caffeine

1084
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,550
90 to 120 minutes after waking

1085
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,753
would be the ideal scenario
most days and most scenarios.

1086
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,680
All that said, I
absolutely respect the fact

1087
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,990
that people have different work schedules,

1088
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,000
kid schedules, et cetera.

1089
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,760
So if you want to do some
or none or all these tools,

1090
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,593
that's really up to you.

1091
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:05,040
I'm just providing them to you

1092
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,610
in the simplest form that I
can possibly provide them.

1093
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,350
Now, the other lever or tool

1094
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,570
that you have available to you is food.

1095
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,640
Not just what you eat, but when you eat.

1096
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,700
And it turns out that if
you eat early in the day,

1097
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,120
you support a biological clock mechanism

1098
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,240
that will make you more
alert early in the day.

1099
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
That said, many people choose to fast

1100
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,870
in the early morning hours of the day

1101
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,040
or in the first part of the day.

1102
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,910
I'm one such person.

1103
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,640
I generally don't ingest any food

1104
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,190
until about 11:00 a.m. or 12 noon.

1105
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,750
Sometimes I'll have a protein shake.

1106
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,100
Sometimes I'll have some almonds.

1107
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,240
Sometimes I'll have breakfast.

1108
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,860
If people are meeting
for brunch or breakfast,

1109
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,886
I will have breakfast for social reasons

1110
00:40:42,886 --> 00:40:43,890
every once in a while.

1111
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,206
But most of the time I don't
eat until about lunch time.

1112
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,050
However, some people are really hungry

1113
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,160
when they wake up in the morning.

1114
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Just know that if you
eat early in the day,

1115
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,640
you are further triggering
an increase in metabolism

1116
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,970
and in temperature that
will make you more alert.

1117
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,130
So you don't have to eat early in the day,

1118
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,300
but you can start to see

1119
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,980
how these different tools layer together.

1120
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,430
Sunlight viewing, exercise,
cold water, eating.

1121
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,860
Many of them are converging
on the same mechanisms.

1122
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,940
In fact, when you drink caffeine,

1123
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,130
there's also a small
increase in body temperature

1124
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,217
due to the adrenaline
increase that it stimulates.

1125
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:19,500
So all of these things can be
layered on top of one another

1126
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,970
or you can use them individually

1127
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,350
or think about them individually.

1128
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,230
Now, food is an interesting lever or tool

1129
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,760
because it's not just about when you eat,

1130
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,740
but it's also about what you eat.

1131
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,620
And I've talked a lot
about eating for energy

1132
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,600
and what that means in
terms of caloric energy

1133
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,490
versus neural energy, et cetera,

1134
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,080
in previous podcast episodes.

1135
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,370
We're not going to focus on that now

1136
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,380
because, frankly, to
get into a description

1137
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,450
of whether or not somebody
should eat fruits or vegetables

1138
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,270
or animal proteins or dairy,
et cetera, early in the day,

1139
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,350
that's very nuanced.

1140
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,640
What you eat for your breakfast,

1141
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,930
or if you choose to not eat breakfast,

1142
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,310
is really up to you.

1143
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:53,550
All that said, if you
eat a very large meal,

1144
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,790
it doesn't matter if you
slept terrifically well

1145
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,260
10 hours the night before

1146
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,180
or if you are about to go to sleep

1147
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,010
or if it's the middle of the afternoon,

1148
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,110
if your gut is full of food,

1149
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,150
there's just a large
volume of food in your gut,

1150
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,030
it's going to divert a lot of blood

1151
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,430
and other critical resources

1152
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,110
away from other organs of your body,

1153
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,550
in particular, your brain,

1154
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,890
and you're going to be sleepy
after eating a big meal.

1155
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,240
So this is sort of a duh,

1156
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,730
but I think oftentimes in the discussions

1157
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,440
about what to eat for energy,

1158
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,050
people neglect to consider food volume

1159
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,350
as a strong parameter or
variable in that discussion.

1160
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,700
So if you eat a huge breakfast,

1161
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,830
it's likely that you are going to be tired

1162
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,480
immediately after eating that breakfast

1163
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,700
unless of course you exercise
very hard prior to that

1164
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,640
and you metabolize all
that food very quickly.

1165
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,470
So it's up to you whether or not to eat

1166
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,300
first thing in the morning or not.

1167
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,360
But if you do eat in the first
few hours of the morning,

1168
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,250
just understand that you are setting

1169
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,870
or you are helping to set

1170
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,620
a food entrained, as it's
called, circadian clock.

1171
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,300
Light, temperature, timing of food intake,

1172
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,140
movement and exercise,

1173
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,430
all of these things literally
funnel in in a neural sense,

1174
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,550
they funnel into this thing
that we call the circadian clock

1175
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,430
and they let that clock,
that set of neurons,

1176
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,670
predict when you are likely
to be eating and active

1177
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,680
and viewing sunlight

1178
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,450
the next day and the next
day and the next day.

1179
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,120
I say all this because there
are some beautiful studies,

1180
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,460
and I'll highlight one, again,
in the show note captions,

1181
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,770
that show that if people
are having a hard time

1182
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,180
waking up in the morning,

1183
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,590
one of the things they can do

1184
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,280
is maximize sunlight viewing,
exercise in the morning,

1185
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,150
drink caffeine.

1186
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,730
Although, again, I support the idea

1187
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,960
that that would best be done

1188
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,543
about 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

1189
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,500
Eating some food in those
early morning hours,

1190
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,333
et cetera, et cetera.

1191
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:45,030
You can layer in multiple levers or tools

1192
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,680
in order to be more alert.

1193
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,580
And that's what these levers
and tools are really there for

1194
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,680
in this sense of what
we're talking about today,

1195
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,300
which is optimizing sleep.

1196
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,650
Yes, they will make you more alert.

1197
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,990
Yes, they will provide some
adrenaline and dopamine,

1198
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,390
for instance, the cold
water, et cetera, et cetera.

1199
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,700
But the reason we're
talking about these things

1200
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,410
in the context of sleep

1201
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,630
is that they start to give your body

1202
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,630
some predictable autonomic timing.

1203
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,640
What is predictable autonomic timing?

1204
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,870
Well, your autonomic nervous system

1205
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:15,210
is the components of your brain and body

1206
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,180
that cause wakefulness and sleepiness

1207
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,180
and you can start to
create some predictability

1208
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,620
in that autonomic timing.

1209
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,990
You can start to do things
that really make it such

1210
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,200
that you naturally wake
up at six in the morning

1211
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,130
or five in the morning.

1212
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,120
That's right, if you're somebody

1213
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,220
who naturally is a night owl,

1214
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,950
who likes to stay up
until two in the morning

1215
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,480
and sleep until 10:00 a.m.,

1216
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,610
and you now have a job or
you have to go to school

1217
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,170
or you have a partner
that likes to get up early

1218
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,700
and go to sleep early,

1219
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,080
well, you can make that happen

1220
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,300
and you can make that
happen pretty painlessly

1221
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,040
if you take a week or so

1222
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,910
and go to sleep 30 minutes or
an hour earlier each night,

1223
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,743
set an alarm

1224
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:56,070
and wake up 30 minutes or
an hour earlier each morning

1225
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,150
until, of course, you're waking up

1226
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,140
at the time you want to wake up,

1227
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,333
and then even in that groggy state,

1228
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,330
get some exercise, get
some sunlight viewing.

1229
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,200
If the sun's not out,

1230
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,120
turn on those bright artificial lights.

1231
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,220
Have some breakfast, even
if you're not hungry.

1232
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,160
In fact, for those of you
that engage in shift work

1233
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,000
because you have to,

1234
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,010
or travel and you're jet lagged,

1235
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:17,190
one of the quickest ways to
shift your circadian clock

1236
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,510
and get onto the local schedule

1237
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,640
is to eat on the local schedule.

1238
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,690
So what all these tools do is
they really set up a cascade.

1239
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,360
Think of it as kind of a
wavefront of wakefulness and focus

1240
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,320
throughout the day.

1241
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,427
It'll take you through
the middle of the day

1242
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,460
and the afternoon stage we'll
talk about in a few minutes,

1243
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,160
but really they take you to this period

1244
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,670
that is about 5:00 p.m.
until your bedtime.

1245
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,500
I realize some people are
going to bed very early,

1246
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,470
like 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m.,
which to me seems very early,

1247
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,870
but very few people go to
sleep at 5:00 p.m. right?

1248
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,480
Unless you're doing that for
shift work or other reasons.

1249
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,650
But from 5:00 p.m. until bedtime
is really a critical period

1250
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,020
in which you need to
leverage particular tools

1251
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,260
in order to get and stay asleep optimally

1252
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,850
and to be able to sleep through the night.

1253
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,710
So really there are three critical periods

1254
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,480
throughout each 24-hour cycle.

1255
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,220
And during each of those critical periods,

1256
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,720
you're going to want to do

1257
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,150
as many specific things as you can

1258
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,710
to optimize your wakefulness

1259
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,480
and focus and mood throughout the day

1260
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,090
and your sleep at night.

1261
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:15,990
The first critical period

1262
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,880
is the one that we've been
talking about up until now.

1263
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,230
Things like morning sunlight viewing,

1264
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,480
caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking,

1265
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,920
exercise, and so on.

1266
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,570
We can call that critical period one

1267
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,630
and it really encompasses the
time from which you wake up

1268
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,150
until about three hours after waking.

1269
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,440
Although, I should just mention

1270
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,347
'cause there are always
those people that say,

1271
00:46:32,347 --> 00:46:33,750
"Wait, I wake up at 4:00 a.m.

1272
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,330
and the sun isn't out until 8:00 a.m.,"

1273
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,170
okay, so it might be four hours.

1274
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,100
But really it's those early
morning hours of your day

1275
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,450
once you're awake.

1276
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,160
The second critical period

1277
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,070
is the time throughout
the day and afternoon

1278
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,360
leading into evening.

1279
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,980
So you may ask what are
the things that you can do

1280
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,970
throughout the day,

1281
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,810
the middle of your day

1282
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,520
and into the afternoon and evening hours,

1283
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,630
that are really going to set you up

1284
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,210
for the best possible
sleep later that night.

1285
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,330
Well, there are a few dos
and there are a few don'ts.

1286
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,320
First of all,

1287
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,690
be careful about ingesting
too much caffeine

1288
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,680
throughout the middle of the day.

1289
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,760
That's kind of an obvious one

1290
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,040
for the reasons that we
talked about earlier.

1291
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,950
Second of all, if you are a napper,

1292
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,150
and I raise my hand now,

1293
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,983
for those of you listening,

1294
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:15,180
I'm raising my right
hand because I love naps.

1295
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,470
I've always loved naps.

1296
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,730
Nowadays I do NSDR or
a Reveri sleep hypnosis

1297
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,260
almost every day.

1298
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,910
And I tend to do that, as I mentioned,

1299
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,410
in the early afternoon hours

1300
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,910
if I'm feeling kind of sleepy,

1301
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,080
because even though I optimize

1302
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,360
my caffeine intake timing, et cetera,

1303
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,310
I tend to get a little
sleepy in the afternoon.

1304
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,140
Most people get a little
sleepy in the afternoon.

1305
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,100
Some of that is related

1306
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,080
to hitting that peak of body temperature.

1307
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,660
And you might think, wait, I
thought high body temperature

1308
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,400
is associated with alertness,

1309
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,233
and it is,

1310
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,490
but right as you crest
that high body temperature

1311
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,230
and your body temperature starts to drop,

1312
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,970
there's a tendency to
be a little bit sleepy.

1313
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,120
So some of you might opt to
take a nap in the afternoon.

1314
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,920
Should you nap, should you not nap?

1315
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,480
That's a question that I get asked a lot

1316
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,070
and that I asked Dr. Matthew Walker

1317
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,630
when he was a guest on this podcast.

1318
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,480
Here was his answer and
here's what the data support.

1319
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,120
It is fine to nap in the afternoon,

1320
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,570
but don't nap so late in
the day or for so long

1321
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,980
that it disrupts your ability

1322
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,110
to fall and stay asleep at night

1323
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,940
for your major sleep about, okay?

1324
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,260
So naps are fine,

1325
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,360
but don't sleep so long during the day

1326
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,920
or too late in the day

1327
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,040
that it disrupts your ability
to fall and stay asleep.

1328
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,043
I should also say you do not have to nap.

1329
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:24,600
It's kind of an interesting phenomenon

1330
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,910
that happens on these
podcasts and on social media

1331
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,020
where we'll talk about naps

1332
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,940
and the fact that naps are great,

1333
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,950
but don't make them
longer than 90 minutes,

1334
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,290
but then all the non-nappers
get really worried.

1335
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,490
Like, wait, am I supposed to nap?

1336
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,170
I don't like naps. I wake up groggy.

1337
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:38,490
You do not have to nap.

1338
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,330
In fact, if you can make it

1339
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,980
through your whole day without napping,

1340
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,150
great, more power to you.

1341
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:45,750
But if you do nap and you
find that naps serve you well,

1342
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,550
keep those naps shorter than 90 minutes

1343
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,400
for reasons related to
ultradian cycles and so forth,

1344
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,460
and make sure that you don't
nap too late in the day

1345
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,260
that you are then staying
up too late at night

1346
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,660
and having a hard time
waking up the next morning.

1347
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,780
I will say that for a lot of
people who do not like naps

1348
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,050
or that find they wake up
really grumpy from naps

1349
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,000
or groggy from naps,

1350
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,660
I encourage you to try the Reveri app,

1351
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,930
try an NSDR script, try yoga nidra.

1352
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,130
Try something of that sort

1353
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,980
for anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30 minutes.

1354
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,350
I tend to do this every day now.

1355
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,480
I'll just lie down, and I love yoga nidra,

1356
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,740
I love NSDR scripts,

1357
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,330
I love using the Reveri app.

1358
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,000
In particular, the
portion of the Reveri app

1359
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,590
that gets you better at sleeping.

1360
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,900
It really is beneficial for me

1361
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,660
because it serves as very replenishing

1362
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,160
while I'm doing that hypnosis,

1363
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,570
but it's also gotten me much better

1364
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,890
at falling and staying asleep

1365
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,080
and falling back asleep in
the middle of the night.

1366
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,210
So this critical period throughout the day

1367
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,070
is one in which most people
are doing a lot of stuff.

1368
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,630
They're emailing and picking up kids

1369
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,910
and they're exercising
and they're commuting

1370
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:48,750
and doing all sorts of things,

1371
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,700
taking phone calls and Zooms, et cetera.

1372
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,340
But if you can get that
period of deep relaxation

1373
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,410
through a nap or NSDR,

1374
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,670
that's going to serve you well.

1375
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,230
Try not to drink too much caffeine,

1376
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,320
certainly no more than a
hundred milligrams of caffeine,

1377
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,310
after 4:00 p.m

1378
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,310
if your goal is to fall asleep
at a reasonably normal time.

1379
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,820
And for those of you that
exercise in the afternoon,

1380
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,180
understand that if you
exercise very intensely,

1381
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,740
so this might be weight
training or running

1382
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,870
or some other very intense exercise,

1383
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,940
typically that's going to further increase

1384
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,350
your body temperature.

1385
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,183
Makes sense, right?

1386
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,016
Based on everything we know

1387
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,527
about metabolism and body temperature.

1388
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:26,220
And it's going to so-called
delay your circadian clock.

1389
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,360
It's going to make it such

1390
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,630
that you want to fall
asleep a little bit later,

1391
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,980
maybe even a lot later.

1392
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,740
So if you're exercising in
the afternoon or evening

1393
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,180
and that's the only time you can exercise

1394
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,220
or that's the time that
you prefer to exercise,

1395
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,460
great, but be careful about
ingesting too much caffeine

1396
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,350
in order to get the
energy to do that exercise

1397
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,720
'cause that caffeine
will disrupt your sleep

1398
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,680
and just know that you are
delaying your circadian clock.

1399
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,640
You are making it such

1400
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,130
that you will naturally
want to go to sleep later

1401
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,780
and wake up later.

1402
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,780
Contrast that with if you
exercise early in the day,

1403
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,580
say, immediately after waking up

1404
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,930
or in the first zero to
four hours after waking,

1405
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,880
in most cases, that's not going to shift

1406
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,560
your circadian clock much.

1407
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,120
And toward the end of the episode,

1408
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,060
we'll talk a little bit
about forced exercise

1409
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,470
prior to wake-up times.

1410
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,970
That doesn't mean doing
exercise in your sleep.

1411
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,440
That means deliberately setting an alarm

1412
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,700
and getting out of bed much earlier

1413
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,900
than you naturally would.

1414
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,150
That turns out to be a very potent tool

1415
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,800
to so-called advance your circadian clock.

1416
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,260
So we can talk about that a
little bit later in the episode.

1417
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,500
But this critical period,
too, in the middle of the day

1418
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,960
is when you're going to want
to leverage specific tools,

1419
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,820
and we've talked about those:

1420
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,470
limiting caffeine intake;

1421
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,950
being mindful of the
clock-delaying effects of exercise;

1422
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,410
the fact that, also,
if you're going to nap,

1423
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,610
you don't want to nap too
long or too late into the day

1424
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,590
otherwise you'll disrupt
your nighttime sleep.

1425
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,350
So this critical period two,

1426
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,820
or second critical period, I should say,

1427
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,960
during the middle of the day

1428
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,910
is a time in which you should
be doing certain things

1429
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,380
and avoiding doing certain things.

1430
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,730
So that raises the
question of whether or not

1431
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,770
you should also be getting a lot of light,

1432
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,720
in particular, sunlight,
throughout the day.

1433
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,340
Now, that's something that
hasn't been explored too much

1434
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,173
in the literature

1435
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:08,340
until recently when Dr. Samer Hattar

1436
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,710
who's the director of
the chronobiology unit

1437
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,420
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

1438
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,680
decided to do a number of experiments

1439
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,750
exploring the effects of light on mood

1440
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,570
and other aspects of brain
function and body function

1441
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,340
when that light is delivered
not just in the morning,

1442
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,390
which is great for us,

1443
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,860
but also throughout the day.

1444
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,900
So should you be looking at sunlight

1445
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,219
or bright artificial
lights throughout the day?

1446
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,260
Now, on the face of it,

1447
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,480
you might just think, yes,
you know, sunlight's great.

1448
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,280
Provided we're not getting a sunburn

1449
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,770
and we're not staring at the
sun and damaging our eyes,

1450
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,110
we should get as much
sunlight as we possibly can.

1451
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,630
In fact, we talked about this
in the episode on hormones

1452
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,394
about how getting light
onto as much of our skin

1453
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:44,190
as we can throughout the day

1454
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,510
can really help in the production

1455
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,550
of testosterone and estrogen
in both men and women

1456
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,770
in healthy ways that
improves mood and libido

1457
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,760
and all sorts of things that
are associated with wellbeing.

1458
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,310
However, because light is
such a powerful stimulus

1459
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,570
for controlling the timing

1460
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,420
of your sleepfulness, or
sleepiness, I should say,

1461
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,370
and wakefulness,

1462
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,510
we might want to be cautious

1463
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,150
about how much light we are
viewing in the afternoon,

1464
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,090
in particular, in the
early evening hours, right?

1465
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,000
Well, turns out it's
not so straightforward.

1466
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,940
Viewing, so sunlight to the eyes, sunlight

1467
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,220
in the late afternoon and evening hours,

1468
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,810
so again, depends on time of year,

1469
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,120
depends on location that
you happen to be in,

1470
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,530
but getting some sunlight in your eyes

1471
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,520
for, again, maybe five
or 10, maybe 30 minutes,

1472
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,470
depending on how much
cloud cover there is,

1473
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,330
doing that in the afternoon

1474
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:33,210
serves an additional beneficial purpose,

1475
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,860
which is you protect or you
inoculate your nervous system

1476
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,930
against some of the negative effects

1477
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,550
of bright artificial light

1478
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:46,050
or even dim artificial
light in the nighttime hours

1479
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,370
between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.,

1480
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,320
which is really critical period three.

1481
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,780
And we'll talk about what
to do and what to not do

1482
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,810
during critical period three
of every 24-hour cycle.

1483
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,360
But to make it very clear
what I'm saying here,

1484
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,400
get that morning sunlight in your eyes,

1485
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,470
but also get some sunlight in your eyes

1486
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,690
in the late afternoon and evening hours

1487
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,760
when the sun is at
so-called low solar angle,

1488
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,890
when it starts to descend in the sky.

1489
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,720
Again, you don't have to
stare directly at the sun,

1490
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,580
although if you can catch
a nice, beautiful sunset,

1491
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,420
go for it.

1492
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,052
But as the sun starts to descend,

1493
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,889
it triggers those same neurons in your eye

1494
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,090
that communicate with
your circadian clock,

1495
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,150
but it communicates with
a different component

1496
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,340
or different compartment
within the circadian clock.

1497
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,560
That circadian clock
is not just one thing.

1498
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,393
It's multiple things.

1499
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:30,990
And you have what are
called morning oscillators

1500
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,070
and evening oscillators.

1501
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,810
And to make a long story short,

1502
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,530
the tool that I'm describing
of looking at the sun

1503
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,510
in the late afternoon and evening,

1504
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,760
again, blinking is fine,

1505
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,690
don't stare at the sun,

1506
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,980
but getting that sunlight in your eyes

1507
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,780
in the late afternoon and evening

1508
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,130
signals to that clock
that it's evening time

1509
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,960
and that sleep is coming.

1510
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,460
It also serves as a second
anchor or reference point

1511
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,880
for your body and your brain
to know where it is in time.

1512
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,500
Remember back to the
beginning of the episode

1513
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,840
when I said your brain and
your body and all your organs

1514
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,060
are locked inside this skin and this skull

1515
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,340
and they don't know what's
going on in the outside world.

1516
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,777
Well, that morning sunlight viewing

1517
00:55:09,777 --> 00:55:12,870
and the other things you do
during critical period one,

1518
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,420
those provide one strong set of signals

1519
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,827
that it's wake-up time
and time to be alert

1520
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:18,330
and time to be focused.

1521
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,190
And then in the evening,

1522
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,610
by getting sunlight in your eyes again,

1523
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,260
in particular, sunlight that comes

1524
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,810
from low solar angle sunlight,

1525
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,850
well, that provides a second stimulus

1526
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,440
or a second reference point

1527
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,990
that tells your brain and
body, "Hey, it's evening.

1528
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,700
The sun is descending."

1529
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,533
Now, you might say,

1530
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,610
"Wait, how does the brain
and these neurons know

1531
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,560
the difference between morning
light and evening light?"

1532
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,670
It turns out has to do

1533
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,890
with the particular wavelengths of light

1534
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,170
that are present in
morning versus evening.

1535
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,820
It's an incredible mechanism.

1536
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,760
And you are probably
familiar with the fact

1537
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,770
that when the sun is directly overhead,

1538
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,500
it's really bright white and yellow

1539
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,760
and the sky's often blue,

1540
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,690
and if there's cloud cover,

1541
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,580
it just comes through as
a bunch of bright light,

1542
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,990
well, next time you're out in the morning,

1543
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,670
take a look at what a sunrise looks like.

1544
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,860
There's a lot of yellow-blue contrast,

1545
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,570
and those yellow blues signal

1546
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,630
important specific sets of
cells in your eye and brain

1547
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:10,620
that it's morning.

1548
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,110
In the evening, you're also
going to see yellow and blue,

1549
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,440
but the ratio of yellows
and blues has now changed

1550
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,760
and you also see some oranges,

1551
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,339
and in a really brilliant
sunset, you'll see some reds.

1552
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:22,320
If you haven't noticed this already,

1553
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,430
you'll really want to look for this.

1554
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,890
It's really kind of fun
and cool to look at.

1555
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,830
Well, those yellows and blues and oranges

1556
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:30,330
that you see in the evening sunsets,

1557
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:33,330
those signal to your brain
and body that evening is there

1558
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,770
and that nighttime is coming

1559
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,120
and they're really establishing

1560
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,960
a second reference point or
wavefront of biological signals

1561
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,237
that are going to optimize
your nighttime hours

1562
00:56:42,237 --> 00:56:45,120
and your transition into
really terrific sleep.

1563
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,170
So now let's talk

1564
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,780
about what I'm calling
critical period three

1565
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,160
of each 24-hour cycle.

1566
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,010
So this would be the period
of time of late evening,

1567
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,560
So it might be 6:00 p.m. for some,

1568
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,610
depending on when you go to sleep,

1569
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,600
or 7:00 p.m.

1570
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,970
extending into the hours

1571
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:02,280
in which you decide to get
into bed and go to sleep

1572
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,870
and then throughout the night.

1573
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,703
There are a number of things

1574
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:05,760
that you're going to want to do

1575
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,200
and there are a number of things

1576
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,390
that you are going to want to avoid doing

1577
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,220
in order to optimize your sleep.

1578
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,890
First of all, you're
going to want to avoid

1579
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,060
bright artificial lights of any color.

1580
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,040
Yes, of any color.

1581
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,720
We haven't talked a lot
about blue blockers,

1582
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,820
you know, lenses that
block blue wavelengths

1583
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,190
or short wavelengths of light.

1584
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,840
I don't have anything
against blue blockers.

1585
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,570
In fact, many people find that
blue blockers provide them

1586
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,050
some relief from headache
and some eye strain

1587
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,010
if they wear blue blockers

1588
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,450
throughout the day and certainly at night.

1589
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,890
But you don't need them,

1590
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,050
and even if you do wear them,

1591
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,390
you will find that if
lights are very bright,

1592
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,560
doesn't matter if it's a blue light,

1593
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,330
a yellow light, or a red light,

1594
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,660
those bright lights will
wake up your brain and body.

1595
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,060
They will activate the same mechanisms

1596
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,490
that were activated early
in the day by sunlight.

1597
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,520
However, and here's the
really diabolical twist,

1598
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,353
I mentioned this earlier,

1599
00:57:57,353 --> 00:57:58,680
but the diabolical twist

1600
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,260
in the way that your brain
and body respond to light

1601
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,240
is that early in the day,

1602
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,980
in the morning hours, you
need a lot of bright light,

1603
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,090
ideally from sunlight,

1604
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,550
to be very alert and to wake up,

1605
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,950
but in the evening hours
and nighttime hours,

1606
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,550
it takes very little
light, very few photons,

1607
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:17,070
in order to wake up your brain and body

1608
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,370
and to disrupt your circadian
clock and disrupt your sleep.

1609
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,433
So what that means is that
once the sun goes down,

1610
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,370
which, of course, is going to happen

1611
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,920
at different times of year
in different places on earth,

1612
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,600
but once the sun goes down,

1613
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,940
you would be wise to
try and dim the lights

1614
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,490
in your indoor environment
most days, right?

1615
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:36,900
I realize some nights you're
going to throw a party

1616
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,950
and have people over.

1617
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:38,970
You might not want to dim the lights.

1618
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,320
Some nights you're going to go out,

1619
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,550
you might view a lot of bright lights.

1620
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,530
But most nights of your life,

1621
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,150
you're going to want to dim the lights

1622
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,173
in your internal environment.

1623
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:50,610
And ideally, the lights that you do use

1624
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,830
you would place low in
that physical environment.

1625
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,020
So you would try and
not use overhead lights,

1626
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,510
but rather rely on desk lamps or lights

1627
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:00,003
even placed low to the
floor, even on the floor.

1628
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,360
If you are going to use light at night,

1629
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,920
and most people do,

1630
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,530
I would encourage you to use
as little artificial light

1631
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:10,290
as is required to carry
out the activities you need

1632
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,820
to require safely.

1633
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,653
That could be studying,

1634
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:14,430
in which case you might
need a little bit more light

1635
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,050
in order to read or study.

1636
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,150
If you're watching a television show

1637
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,920
or you're watching
something on your computer,

1638
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,510
dim that screen way, way down,

1639
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,180
as dim as possible while
still, of course, being able

1640
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,560
to view what you need to view.

1641
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,810
Even better, I should say, ideally,

1642
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,150
you would use candlelight
and/or moonlight.

1643
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,890
Now, some nights the moon is really bright

1644
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,660
and you actually can use moonlight

1645
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,370
to go about your usual activities.

1646
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,920
Moonlight might seem very, very bright,

1647
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,750
but, actually, moonlight is
fairly low light intensity,

1648
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,390
and candlelight, which
can also seem very bright,

1649
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,850
actually is very low light intensity.

1650
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,950
If you're sitting across a table

1651
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:50,880
with some candlelight there

1652
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,710
and it's a really bright candle,

1653
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,950
chances are it's only
about three to 10 lux,

1654
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:58,590
which is very, very little light energy

1655
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:00,780
compared to, say, an artificial desk lamp

1656
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,613
or an overhead light,

1657
01:00:01,613 --> 01:00:02,670
which is going to be in the area

1658
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,640
of anywhere from a
hundred to a thousand lux.

1659
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,410
So candlelight is fine.

1660
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,930
Of course, be cautious with open flame,

1661
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,190
but candlelight is fine.

1662
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,210
Moonlight is fine.

1663
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,310
Dimming artificial lights is fine

1664
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,230
provided they're dimmed way, way down.

1665
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:20,400
And again, try and avoid using
overhead artificial lights.

1666
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,570
The absolute worst lights

1667
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:23,120
are going to be overhead
fluorescent lights

1668
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,040
of the sort that you would
have in the supermarket

1669
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,470
or that you would see at a gas station

1670
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:29,550
or something of that sort.

1671
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,570
And I confess, there are times
in which I'm driving home

1672
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,760
and it's late at night and I
want to be able to get to sleep

1673
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,740
and I'll need to stop at the grocery store

1674
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,060
or a gas station or something like that,

1675
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,950
I've actually put on sunglasses at night

1676
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,420
in order to avoid getting

1677
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,090
that bright light exposure at night.

1678
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,800
Although that's a little bit extreme,

1679
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,390
I have done that from time to time

1680
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:50,040
because that bright light exposure

1681
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,860
will absolutely quash, it will eliminate,

1682
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,530
any melatonin that
happens to be circulating

1683
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,363
in your brain and body.

1684
01:00:56,363 --> 01:00:58,560
Now, melatonin, a lot of people
think of it as a supplement,

1685
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,810
but melatonin is naturally released

1686
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,750
as the evening comes about
and into the nighttime hours.

1687
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,760
It's the hormone that
makes you feel sleepy

1688
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,440
and allows you to fall asleep.

1689
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,150
So viewing bright light

1690
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:11,010
in the late evening
hours and nighttime hours

1691
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:14,490
is really not good for your sleep quality

1692
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,010
and your ability to fall and stay asleep.

1693
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,200
So for most people, a simple rule of thumb

1694
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,100
is going to be avoid bright
artificial lights of all colors,

1695
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,200
and in particular, overhead
bright artificial lights,

1696
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,630
between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.

1697
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,130
That's right, between
10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.,

1698
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,280
avoid those bright artificial
lights as much as possible.

1699
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,550
Use only as much light as
is absolutely necessary

1700
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,950
in order to carry out the
routines and activities

1701
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,840
you need to carry out safely.

1702
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,673
I should mention

1703
01:01:40,673 --> 01:01:42,930
that the reason overhead
lights are problematic

1704
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:45,660
is the same reason why
sunlight is so great

1705
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,493
early in the day,

1706
01:01:46,493 --> 01:01:49,050
which is that the cells,
that is, the neurons,

1707
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,480
that can wake up your brain and body

1708
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,430
through activation of the circadian clock

1709
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,220
reside mainly in the bottom half or 2/3

1710
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,180
of your neural retina

1711
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,220
and the way the optics of your eyes work

1712
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,530
is that the cells on the
bottom half of your eye

1713
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,940
view the upper visual field.

1714
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,850
So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism

1715
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,080
that allows these cells

1716
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,400
to respond to overhead light from sunlight

1717
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,170
in the early part of the
day and throughout the day.

1718
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,717
But in the evening, if you have
bright artificial lights on

1719
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:18,300
and those bright artificial
lights are overhead lights,

1720
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,790
it's going to more closely mimic

1721
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,400
what sunlight does in the evening time,

1722
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,690
and that turns out to be a bad thing

1723
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,640
if your goal is to eventually go to sleep.

1724
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,064
So again, do like the Scandinavians do.

1725
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:32,100
Use lights that are set
low in the room at night,

1726
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,100
and if you really want to
optimize your sleep-wake cycles,

1727
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,470
I suppose you could also do the
opposite throughout the day.

1728
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,820
You could really emphasize the use

1729
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,220
of bright artificial lights and sunlight

1730
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,053
that comes from above.

1731
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:43,860
And of course, sunlight
always comes from above.

1732
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,600
But if you're working in
a given office environment

1733
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,220
and, you know, it's 2:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m.

1734
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,080
and you want to be as awake as possible,

1735
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:52,913
really crank up the overhead lights.

1736
01:02:52,913 --> 01:02:54,810
And then in the evening,

1737
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,090
which is this critical period
three that we're referring to,

1738
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,090
really try and dim those
lights or have them off

1739
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,830
or just rely on candlelight or moonlight

1740
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,280
from the hours of about
10:00 p.m. until 4:00 a.m.

1741
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,570
Our good friend Samer Hattar,

1742
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,100
who's been on this podcast before,

1743
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,170
Samer is director of
the chronobiology unit

1744
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,210
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

1745
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:15,180
well, he's absolutely obsessive
about this light stuff

1746
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,110
and avoiding light at night.

1747
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,290
In fact, he lives in what I sort of joke

1748
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,460
is like a cave at night.

1749
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,350
From 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m.,

1750
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,380
which is really his kind of sleep cycle,

1751
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,330
he has his house so dark

1752
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,320
that you'd be lucky to be able

1753
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,940
to find a spoon in the kitchen.

1754
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,773
In fact, you'd be lucky

1755
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,550
to find your way down
the hallway if you're me.

1756
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,350
But in any case, dim the lights.

1757
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,610
Turn them way, way down.

1758
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,540
It will serve you well.

1759
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,760
It will make it much easier for you

1760
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,790
to get sleepy and stay
sleepy and fall asleep

1761
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,560
and stay asleep throughout the night.

1762
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,440
Now, not to depart from
this critical period three,

1763
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,433
but if you recall, viewing
that afternoon light,

1764
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,860
the low solar angle light

1765
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,750
as the sun is heading down in the sky,

1766
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:55,830
so it could be sunset

1767
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:59,490
or what I call circa
sunset, around sunset,

1768
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,680
well, doing that is going to slightly,

1769
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,500
but not completely, offset
any of the negative effects

1770
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,810
of viewing artificial light at night.

1771
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,490
So I don't want to give
people a pass here,

1772
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,840
but let's say you know

1773
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,020
that you're going to watch
some Netflix at night

1774
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,910
or you're going to be up late studying

1775
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,550
and yet you still want to be
able to fall and stay asleep.

1776
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:20,070
Definitely make sure you
see that evening light.

1777
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:21,300
There's a great study.

1778
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,530
We'll provide a link to this study,

1779
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,850
which showed that if people
view evening sunset light

1780
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:27,870
or evening sunsets

1781
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,030
or sunlight right around
the time of sunset,

1782
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:33,750
it really serves to
inoculate or offset some,

1783
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,730
again, some, not all,
of the negative effects

1784
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,563
of artificial light

1785
01:04:36,563 --> 01:04:38,700
between the hours of
10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.

1786
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,533
Now, that's light.

1787
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:40,410
But as you recall,

1788
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,170
we also have this tool
related to temperature,

1789
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,140
and you're probably not
going to be surprised

1790
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,690
that the way to leverage
temperature in the evening

1791
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:49,770
is the exact opposite

1792
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,690
of the way that you want
to leverage temperature

1793
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:52,523
early in the day.

1794
01:04:52,523 --> 01:04:54,300
Early in the day, temperature increases

1795
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:57,240
from cold showers or exercise,
et cetera, wake you up.

1796
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,970
What that means is that taking
a cold shower late at night

1797
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,890
is probably a bad idea.

1798
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:05,043
Rather, taking a nice hot bath or a sauna,

1799
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:07,680
you might think would heat up your body,

1800
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,700
and indeed, that's what happens

1801
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,320
if you stay in a very long time,

1802
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,690
but if you do hot tub or a hot bath

1803
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:13,740
or a sauna in the evening,

1804
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,930
and you don't stay in for
more than 20 or 30 minutes

1805
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,763
and you get out,

1806
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:20,340
you take maybe a cool-ish
shower or a warm shower,

1807
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:23,370
then what happens is there's
a compensatory cooling off

1808
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:24,630
of your core body temperature

1809
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,070
for the reasons we discussed earlier,

1810
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,100
and your body temperature will
drop by one to three degrees

1811
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,530
and it will make it much
easier to get into sleep.

1812
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:32,363
So if you're somebody

1813
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:35,730
that enjoys hot baths,
hot showers, or hot tubs,

1814
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:36,780
evening and nighttime

1815
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,100
is going to be the best time to do that

1816
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,410
if your goal is to facilitate sleep.

1817
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,940
Similarly, you should try

1818
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,480
and make your sleeping environment
pretty cool, if not cold.

1819
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,830
Now, that doesn't mean you need to be cold

1820
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,970
while you're asleep.

1821
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,830
You can get under as many
blankets as you need,

1822
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:52,740
but it's a good idea to make
your sleeping environment cool.

1823
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,020
In fact, drop the temperature
in that sleeping environment

1824
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,970
by at least three degrees

1825
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,740
and you'll be happy that you did.

1826
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,140
Now, some people rely on
things like Eight Sleep.

1827
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,973
I use that.

1828
01:06:01,973 --> 01:06:05,070
One of these controllable
temperature mattress covers.

1829
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,480
Other people would simply do this

1830
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,270
by putting a fan in the
room or opening a window.

1831
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:10,410
Again, depends on time of year,

1832
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,660
depends on technology,
depends on budgets, et cetera.

1833
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,890
But you're going to want to sleep

1834
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:16,650
in a relatively cool or
cold sleeping environment

1835
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,880
and then layer on the blankets
as needed to stay asleep.

1836
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,040
And I say as needed
because one of the things

1837
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,590
that you're going to do in your sleep,

1838
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,120
or if you happen to wake up,

1839
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,210
is if you're too warm, you're
going to put a foot or a hand

1840
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:32,250
out from under those blankets.

1841
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,470
And the reason for doing
that is very logical

1842
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,970
once you understand the mechanism.

1843
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:37,680
You have special portals,

1844
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,560
you essentially have ways of passing heat,

1845
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,110
excuse me, in and out of your body

1846
01:06:43,110 --> 01:06:44,880
primarily through the palms of your hands,

1847
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,900
the upper half of your face,

1848
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,220
and the bottoms of your feet

1849
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,540
through so-called glabrous skin.

1850
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,880
This was covered in the
episode with Dr. Craig Heller

1851
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
from the biology department at Stanford.

1852
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,890
If you lower the temperature
in your sleeping environment,

1853
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,510
so lower the temperature in that room

1854
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:00,480
or use a controllable mattress
cover that can cool down

1855
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,310
like Eight Sleep or
something of that sort,

1856
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,670
it's naturally going to make
your sleep environment cooler,

1857
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,770
and if you're too warm under the blankets,

1858
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,660
all you have to do is
extend a hand or a foot

1859
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,040
out from under those blankets.

1860
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,840
Whereas if the sleeping
environment that you're in

1861
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,040
is too warm,

1862
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,050
there's very little you can do to cool off

1863
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,790
besides push off those blankets.

1864
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,020
So for instance, if you're too warm

1865
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,340
and you're waking up in
the middle of the night,

1866
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,140
which is what happens if you get too warm,

1867
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,250
you'll push off those blankets.

1868
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,900
But if the room is too warm,

1869
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,733
well, what are you going to do?

1870
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:27,720
You'd probably have to put
your hands into some cool water

1871
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,820
or take a coolish shower or something

1872
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:30,960
for a couple of seconds.

1873
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,340
That's not very practical.

1874
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,190
Better to just keep the
sleeping environment cool.

1875
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,800
I'm not a big fan of
people putting socks on

1876
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,633
while they sleep,

1877
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:40,290
or I should say, I'm not
a fan of putting socks on

1878
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,123
while I sleep,

1879
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,350
because that eliminates
this glabrous skin portal

1880
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,850
on the bottoms of one's feet.

1881
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:45,960
So for those of you that have heard,

1882
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,220
you know, wear socks while you sleep,

1883
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,660
that works great for people

1884
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,910
that tend to run too cold while they sleep

1885
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:52,680
and wake up because their feet get cold,

1886
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,850
but if you're somebody who wakes up

1887
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:54,683
in the middle of the night,

1888
01:07:54,683 --> 01:07:55,516
chances are you're waking up

1889
01:07:55,516 --> 01:07:57,930
because you're getting too warm

1890
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:59,070
and the best thing that you could do

1891
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,050
is to cool or lower the temperature

1892
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:01,920
in the room that you're sleeping

1893
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,030
and not wear socks,

1894
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:05,700
get under as many blankets
as you need to fall asleep,

1895
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,870
and then across the night,

1896
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,640
you'll naturally just
move a hand or a foot

1897
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,770
or all hands and feet out
from under those blankets

1898
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,910
to cool off

1899
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,400
because of the relationship
between temperature and sleep.

1900
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,590
That is, dropping your
core body temperature

1901
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,819
one to three degrees

1902
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:19,949
gets you into sleep and
helps you stay asleep.

1903
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,870
So let's say you do
exercise late in the day

1904
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,760
and you're finding yourself
very alert in the evening

1905
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,350
and you need to fall asleep,

1906
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,729
or let's say you've exercised

1907
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:29,309
and you needed four cups of espresso

1908
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,990
in order to do that exercise.

1909
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,069
Well, there are a few
things that you can do

1910
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:34,169
to try and bring your nervous system down

1911
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:35,819
into more state of calmness,

1912
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:36,652
and you can do that

1913
01:08:36,653 --> 01:08:39,180
also by lowering your
core body temperature.

1914
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:40,740
One of those I already
talked about before,

1915
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,200
taking a nice hot shower or a hot bath

1916
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,490
and then getting out and cooling off

1917
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,319
will decrease your body temperature.

1918
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,539
Maybe not enough to get you into sleep

1919
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,000
if you have a ton of
caffeine in your system.

1920
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,899
But again, you can use this
mechanism of temperature shifts

1921
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,129
to wake up

1922
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,630
or temperature shifts to fall asleep

1923
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:59,729
in ways that really can help you overcome

1924
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:03,569
some of the irregularities
in your sleep-wake cycle

1925
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,459
and exercise cycle, et cetera.

1926
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,319
Because, of course, nobody's perfect.

1927
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:09,539
Some days we end up having
to workout in the afternoon

1928
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,340
or we'll miss the workout entirely.

1929
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,229
Other days, we end up
having that cup of coffee

1930
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:14,159
in the afternoon with a friend

1931
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,960
and then we have a hard
time falling asleep.

1932
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,220
So you can use these tools

1933
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,794
not just in their optimized form,

1934
01:09:18,794 --> 01:09:21,450
you know, being absolutely
obsessive and compulsive

1935
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,640
about exactly when you
do each of those tools.

1936
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,090
That would be wonderful,
but life happens as they say

1937
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,361
and some days you're going
to feel too alert at night

1938
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,420
and you want to fall asleep,

1939
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,420
or you've got to get up
especially early the next morning

1940
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,252
and you're not somebody

1941
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:35,789
who normally goes to bed at 10:00 p.m.

1942
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,950
Well, that's when a something
like a hot bath or a sauna

1943
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:38,783
can really benefit you

1944
01:09:38,783 --> 01:09:41,100
because it can adjust your
temperature rhythm accordingly.

1945
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:44,040
I would be remiss if I
didn't touch on alcohol

1946
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,080
and CBD and THC.

1947
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,000
I always get questions about these.

1948
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,890
And I should say, of course,

1949
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,979
many places, but not all, THC is illegal.

1950
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:54,360
Although, there are medical uses

1951
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,970
and in some places, it's decriminalized,

1952
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,830
other places it's legal.

1953
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,810
Alcohol, of course, is consumed

1954
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,570
almost as frequently as
caffeine is consumed.

1955
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,860
I personally don't drink alcohol.

1956
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,140
I don't have anything against it per se.

1957
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,120
I just don't tend to enjoy it.

1958
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,280
One of the reasons I don't enjoy it

1959
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,930
is if I drink alcohol,
I simply fall asleep.

1960
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,610
So that doesn't really accomplish

1961
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,590
any of the things that I
really want to accomplish

1962
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:20,130
because the sleep that one
gets after drinking alcohol

1963
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,350
is greatly disrupted sleep.

1964
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,810
Hate to break it to you,
but that's the truth.

1965
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:27,450
And when Dr. Matt Walker
came on this podcast,

1966
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,100
he said exactly the same thing.

1967
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,100
While THC and alcohol do
help some people fall asleep

1968
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,360
and maybe even stay asleep,

1969
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,480
the architecture of
that sleep is suboptimal

1970
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,710
compared to the sleep they would get

1971
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,080
without alcohol or THC in their system.

1972
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,630
So I'm not here to tell you
what to do or not to do.

1973
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:48,870
I'm certainly not the substance police.

1974
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,010
That's not my role.

1975
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,570
I'm just reporting to you the biology.

1976
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:54,660
If your sleep is not restoring you

1977
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,670
to the extent that you feel it should,

1978
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,910
or if you are regularly
relying on a drink or two

1979
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,790
in order to fall asleep,

1980
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,500
or THC in order to fall asleep,

1981
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,350
that is disrupting your
total pattern of sleep.

1982
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,730
However, I do realize

1983
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:12,960
that nowadays a lot of people
are relying on THC and/or CBD,

1984
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,100
especially edible forms,

1985
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,767
in order to fall and stay asleep.

1986
01:11:15,767 --> 01:11:18,570
And, you know, we can
just acknowledge the data.

1987
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,480
It does seem that there's
an anxiety lowering effect

1988
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,830
of some of those compounds

1989
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,270
that do help people

1990
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,580
who have a hard time
falling and staying asleep

1991
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,860
because of reasons related to anxiety.

1992
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,693
Although, in a moment,

1993
01:11:29,693 --> 01:11:33,180
we'll talk about some supplements
and supplement protocols

1994
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,150
that can also assist in the
ability to fall and stay asleep

1995
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:37,650
and that can adjust anxiety

1996
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,230
and that do not seem to
disrupt sleep architecture

1997
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,063
in negative ways

1998
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,500
and, in fact, can enhance
the depth and quality

1999
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,820
of sleep architecture.

2000
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,580
Okay, so you've done everything
correctly up until now.

2001
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,663
You got your morning routine
from critical period one.

2002
01:11:49,663 --> 01:11:51,510
You've got your afternoon routine.

2003
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,580
You saw some sunlight in the afternoon.

2004
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,320
You avoided caffeine in the eight hours

2005
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,090
or 10 hours before bedtime.

2006
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,470
You're not drinking alcohol.

2007
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,420
You've cooled down the room.

2008
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,530
You're doing all these things right.

2009
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,170
You've dimmed the lights,
et cetera, et cetera.

2010
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:06,690
What else can we do in
order to optimize our sleep?

2011
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:10,590
Well, I always say behavioral tools first,

2012
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,850
then look to nutrition,

2013
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,520
then, if necessary,
look to supplementation,

2014
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,810
and then, if still necessary,
look to prescription drugs

2015
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,990
obviously prescribed by a
board certified physician.

2016
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,180
Well, we've talked a lot
about the behavioral tools

2017
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,650
for critical period three.

2018
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:26,910
We have not talked a lot

2019
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,920
about the supplementation-based tools.

2020
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,960
There are supplements that for most people

2021
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,070
will greatly improve their
ability to fall and stay asleep

2022
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:38,430
and the three main
supplements in that category

2023
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,800
or that kit of sleep supplements,

2024
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,060
and I've talked about these before,

2025
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:47,060
are magnesium threonate,
so T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,

2026
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,930
apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,

2027
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:55,380
and theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine.

2028
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,970
Now, some important things to point out

2029
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:00,300
about mag threonate, as it's
called, apigenin, and theanine.

2030
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,500
First of all,

2031
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,510
you don't necessarily
need to take all three,

2032
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,940
although, many people
get a synergistic effect

2033
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,170
from taking all three.

2034
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:10,230
In fact, you may not even
need to take even one.

2035
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:13,050
What I recommend is that
if you're already doing

2036
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:15,660
all the behavioral tools regularly

2037
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,910
and you're still having
trouble falling asleep

2038
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:19,440
and staying asleep,

2039
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,040
well, then you might try
one of the supplements

2040
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,150
within this sleep stack.

2041
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,190
They do have fairly
wide margins for safety.

2042
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,530
Although, I should also say,

2043
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,630
anytime you're going to
add or remove something

2044
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:33,090
from your supplement protocol
or your nutritional program,

2045
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:34,590
you definitely want to
talk to your physician.

2046
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,760
I don't just say that to protect us.

2047
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,140
I say that to protect you.

2048
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,300
But for most people, the margins
of safety on these things

2049
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,590
are going to be pretty broad.

2050
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,960
A couple of notes about dosages.

2051
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,540
For some people, the dosages
of any one or several

2052
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:47,820
of the supplements I
mentioned will be zero.

2053
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,930
That is, you won't need them

2054
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:53,220
in order to get and stay asleep
most nights of your life.

2055
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,230
That's terrific if you don't need them.

2056
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,670
For many people, however,

2057
01:13:56,670 --> 01:14:01,170
taking 145 milligrams
of magnesium threonate

2058
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,490
can be very beneficial.

2059
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:06,240
That's the dosage that most
people will benefit from.

2060
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,530
Some people need to go a little higher.

2061
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,510
Some people need to go a little bit lower.

2062
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,160
One of the reasons that
we've been pointing people

2063
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,760
towards single-ingredient
formulations these days

2064
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,140
is because it allows people

2065
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,630
to adjust the dosage of one component

2066
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:19,770
of a so-called sleep stack

2067
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:23,610
without having to disrupt the
dosage of another component,

2068
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:24,443
and so on.

2069
01:14:24,443 --> 01:14:25,560
It also allows people to try

2070
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,320
just one element within the sleep stack

2071
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,960
without having to purchase
and try the others,

2072
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,520
which is a problem if
you're buying a blend

2073
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,930
of a lot of different ingredients.

2074
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:37,080
So 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate.

2075
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,870
50, 5-0, milligrams of apigenin.

2076
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,540
And again, you could just
take the apigenin on its own.

2077
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:46,560
And 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine

2078
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,840
taken, again, alone or in combination

2079
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,360
with the other supplements
mentioned in the stack

2080
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,210
many people find allows
them to get really drowsy

2081
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:56,610
and fall asleep, sleep really deeply,

2082
01:14:56,610 --> 01:14:58,770
and they feel much more
refreshed the next day

2083
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,110
and they don't have a grogginess to them.

2084
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:04,620
Now, a couple of notes about
these different supplements.

2085
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,650
About 5% of people report

2086
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:10,380
that magnesium threonate
really disrupts their gut.

2087
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,630
It gives them diarrhea
or gastric distress.

2088
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:14,430
In which case, don't take it.

2089
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:19,113
If magnesium threonate disrupts
your gut or your digestion

2090
01:15:19,113 --> 01:15:21,210
to a point where it's
uncomfortable or at all

2091
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:23,040
and you don't like it,
don't take any of it.

2092
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,390
The proper dosage for you, in other words,

2093
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:26,130
would be zero milligrams.

2094
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:28,230
Now, in a slightly different way,

2095
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:31,260
many people who can
tolerate magnesium threonate

2096
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,780
or really thrive on magnesium threonate

2097
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,010
and like apigenin

2098
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,050
might find that theanine,

2099
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,150
even at the lowest dose
of a hundred milligrams,

2100
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,190
'cause, again, the range is
a hundred to 400 milligrams,

2101
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:44,070
that theanine gives them such vivid dreams

2102
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:46,350
that they actually find it disruptive

2103
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:47,880
where they wake up in
the middle of the night

2104
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,800
or they find that the
sleep that they're getting

2105
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,360
is kind of anxiety ridden

2106
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,130
because of the intensity of those dreams.

2107
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,200
So some people might
choose to leave theanine

2108
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,370
out of the sleep stack

2109
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:58,227
and just take magnesium
threonate or apigenin

2110
01:15:58,227 --> 01:16:00,510
And again, some people might
leave magnesium threonate

2111
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:01,660
out of the sleep stack.

2112
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,220
Again, all of this is really about finding

2113
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:08,040
the supplementation protocol
that's ideal for you.

2114
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,300
I should mention that whether or not

2115
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,790
you're taking one or two
or three of the components

2116
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:12,783
of the sleep stack,

2117
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,750
the ideal time to take those

2118
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,100
is 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,

2119
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,110
especially if you haven't
had anything to eat

2120
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:21,060
for the three hours or so before bedtime.

2121
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,530
I confess that oftentimes

2122
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:24,120
I'll have a little bit of a
snack late in the evening,

2123
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,560
some berries or something.

2124
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,420
I try not to eat too close to bedtime,

2125
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:29,310
but some evenings just
because of work schedule,

2126
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,290
I'll get home late, be 9:00 p.m.,

2127
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,340
and I'll eat a big meal

2128
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,410
and then I'll take the
sleep stack and fall asleep.

2129
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:36,420
Every once in a while,
that just so happens.

2130
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:39,270
Nobody's perfect. Certainly I'm not.

2131
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,880
But that sleep stack
can be very beneficial.

2132
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,670
And I do think that it's
preferable to melatonin.

2133
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:45,503
Here's the reason.

2134
01:16:45,503 --> 01:16:47,280
First of all, melatonin is a hormone

2135
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,600
that you endogenously make.

2136
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,250
You now know a lot about melatonin

2137
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,020
and it's controlled by light,

2138
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:54,750
meaning light inhibits
it or eliminates it,

2139
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,043
darkness promotes it.

2140
01:16:56,910 --> 01:17:01,110
And melatonin indeed
can help us fall asleep,

2141
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:02,700
but the dosages of melatonin

2142
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,440
that are contained in
most commercial products

2143
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,020
is far, far, far greater

2144
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,250
than what we would make endogenously.

2145
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,890
So it's really supraphysiological.

2146
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:11,820
So that's of concern

2147
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:14,460
because melatonin is not just responsible

2148
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,860
for making us sleepy and fall asleep.

2149
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,118
It also does things

2150
01:17:18,118 --> 01:17:21,030
like interacts with other hormone systems,

2151
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,110
testosterone and estrogen,

2152
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,747
even in the puberty system, in kids.

2153
01:17:24,747 --> 01:17:27,690
Is taking melatonin every
once in a while a problem

2154
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,670
for adjusting to jet lag, et cetera?

2155
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:31,830
Probably not. I would even say no.

2156
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,930
But taking it chronically over time,

2157
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:36,480
especially kids taking
it chronically over time,

2158
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,010
can potentially be problematic.

2159
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:40,230
So at least in my opinion,
these other supplements

2160
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:42,690
are going to be preferable to melatonin.

2161
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:44,730
Now, as I mentioned in the
beginning of today's episode,

2162
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,080
there are some other things

2163
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,939
that I certainly take
every once in a while

2164
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:50,729
and that other people
might consider taking

2165
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:53,910
in addition to the sleep
stack I talked about before

2166
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,740
or in place of that sleep stack

2167
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,570
if that sleep stack
doesn't work well for them.

2168
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,040
So every third or fourth night,

2169
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,710
I will take two grams of glycine

2170
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,690
and a hundred milligrams of GABA

2171
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:06,540
in addition to the standard sleep stack

2172
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,500
that I talked about before.

2173
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,801
So I'm taking mag threonate,
apigenin, and theanine,

2174
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:12,240
and then I will also take two
grams of glycine and GABA,

2175
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:16,080
which I find greatly enhances
my ability to get into sleep.

2176
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,410
But the reason I only add glycine and GABA

2177
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,000
every third or fourth night

2178
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,500
is that if I take it too often,

2179
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,090
I find that the entire sleep stack

2180
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,590
doesn't work quite as effectively.

2181
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:27,210
I don't know exactly why this is the case,

2182
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:29,910
but in any event, that's what I do.

2183
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:33,600
And more recently, I've
also started using inositol,

2184
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,760
in particular myo-inositol.

2185
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,330
Every other night, I'll take
900 milligrams of myo-inositol

2186
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:42,600
in addition to mag threonate,
apigenin, and theanine,

2187
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,620
and not on the nights when
I take glycine and GABA.

2188
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,570
So I'm adding 900 milligrams of inositol

2189
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,460
to the standard sleep stack

2190
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,890
of mag threonate, theanine, and apigenin.

2191
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:56,310
And what I find is not only
does it greatly enhance

2192
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,110
my ability to fall asleep quickly,

2193
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,790
but if I wake up in the
middle of the night,

2194
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:02,580
which I often do to use the bathroom,

2195
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,490
I find it very, very
easy to fall back asleep.

2196
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:10,290
Whereas when I don't take
inositol every other night or so,

2197
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:11,760
I find that if I wake up
in the middle of the night,

2198
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,370
it's a bit more of a
challenge to fall back asleep.

2199
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,950
So inositol has a number of different uses

2200
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:19,560
that have been discussed
in terms of mental health

2201
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,740
and in terms of adjusting
anxiety for its daytime use.

2202
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:23,573
What I'm talking about

2203
01:19:23,573 --> 01:19:26,070
is taking 900 milligrams of myo-inositol

2204
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:28,170
also 30 to 60 minutes before sleep

2205
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:29,430
along with the standard sleep stack

2206
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,500
and I found that to be
immensely beneficial.

2207
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,170
I also noticed that it
has a pretty long tail

2208
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:37,230
of anxiety suppression throughout the day.

2209
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,660
And I'm not somebody who
suffers from anxiety,

2210
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,760
but I have to say it just has led me

2211
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,530
to feel a bit calmer throughout the day,

2212
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,450
and I don't really know how to say this

2213
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:46,560
except in subjective terms,

2214
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,540
to feel a bit more buffered against

2215
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,430
or resilient against stress events.

2216
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:52,590
And if you look at the
literature on inositol

2217
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:53,490
and its interactions

2218
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:56,190
with the serotonin
system and other systems,

2219
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,320
that all makes sense as to
why that would be the case.

2220
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,420
So we'll provide links to
our so-called sleep kit,

2221
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,250
which is part of our
Neural Network Newsletter.

2222
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,360
It's a zero-cost newsletter

2223
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,820
where you can access this
information about supplements

2224
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,610
and other behavioral tools
for sleep in list form.

2225
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,440
But that sleep kit doesn't include

2226
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,460
some of the newer information

2227
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,720
that I've provided this episode,

2228
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,210
in particular, the
information about inositol

2229
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,043
and what I'm finding

2230
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:19,800
to be the very beneficial use of inositol

2231
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,230
for the ability to fall back asleep

2232
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,580
after waking up in the
middle of the night,

2233
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,650
which is something that a
lot of people struggle with.

2234
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,320
Now, that's supplementation
for falling and staying asleep,

2235
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,530
but we can return to the behavioral tools

2236
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,840
also as powerful levers and tools

2237
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,540
for falling asleep and
getting back to sleep.

2238
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,320
And again, we look to
NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

2239
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,870
or the Reveri app as a way to do that.

2240
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:43,703
As I mentioned earlier,

2241
01:20:43,703 --> 01:20:46,830
the Reveri app has been
developed on the basis

2242
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,230
of really high-quality,
peer-reviewed research,

2243
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:51,390
both clinical and non-clinical,

2244
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,860
by my colleague, David Spiegel,

2245
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,140
who's our associate chair
of psychiatry at Stanford.

2246
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,550
It's a wonderful tool.

2247
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:00,390
It does carry a cost after
the initial seven-day trial.

2248
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,522
I can tell you what the cost on that is

2249
01:21:02,522 --> 01:21:03,970
so you can get a sense

2250
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,590
because I do realize that
anything that carries a cost,

2251
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,420
for some people, it won't be accessible.

2252
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,010
Right now, Reveri,

2253
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,910
and I should just mention,

2254
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,170
they didn't pay us for an ad read.

2255
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,670
I'm just telling you what they told me

2256
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:19,380
so that I can accurately report
what it costs to use Reveri.

2257
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,030
They have a monthly subscription

2258
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:23,220
to use the Reveri app at 14.99.

2259
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,050
You do get the seven-day free trial.

2260
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:28,170
They have a yearly subscription of 99.99

2261
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,250
with a seven-day free trial.

2262
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,410
And they have a lifetime
purchase, one-time purchase,

2263
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:33,300
of 249 with no trial.

2264
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,120
It right now is only available
for Apple, not for Android,

2265
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,190
but they are, yes, going
to have it available

2266
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:39,570
for Android soon.

2267
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:41,340
There's a signup list there.

2268
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:45,360
I should mention that while
the cost might seem high,

2269
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,780
if you compare that cost
to, say, supplements,

2270
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:50,670
or you compare that cost to a
poor night's sleep over time,

2271
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:54,420
the cost, at least to me,
seems somewhat modest,

2272
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,340
certainly within range
for a number of people.

2273
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:59,040
But I acknowledge not within
range for other people,

2274
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,880
which is why I also want
to point to zero-cost tools

2275
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,120
and the zero-cost tool for
getting asleep, staying asleep,

2276
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,560
and falling back asleep

2277
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,660
is going to be NSDR.

2278
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,550
We'll put a link to a
non-sleep deep rest protocol

2279
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,570
that's available on YouTube,

2280
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,400
so available to anybody zero cost

2281
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,830
provided you have a internet connection.

2282
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:17,790
Again, dim the screen

2283
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,290
if you're going to turn
that on late at night.

2284
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:22,680
And there are a number of
other yoga nidra scripts

2285
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,620
and apps and sources around the internet,

2286
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,460
in particular, on YouTube,

2287
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,350
that are zero cost that you could use

2288
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,660
if the Reveri app is
outside your price range

2289
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:34,050
or is not preferable to you, et cetera.

2290
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:35,430
When I wake up in the middle of the night,

2291
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:36,570
it's usually to use the restroom.

2292
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:37,403
I'll go use the restroom.

2293
01:22:37,403 --> 01:22:38,880
I'll keep the lights as dim as possible.

2294
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,260
I'll get back into bed.

2295
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,390
And if I find that it's
easy to fall asleep,

2296
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,530
great, I'm asleep.

2297
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:46,560
And if not, then I will
generally plug in the Reveri app.

2298
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,701
They have a fall back asleep hypnosis,

2299
01:22:48,701 --> 01:22:51,690
and 99 times out of a hundred,

2300
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,160
I'm back asleep within minutes

2301
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,660
and I don't wake up until morning.

2302
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,120
Now, very briefly, I just
want to touch on some tools

2303
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,220
that are very commonly used
by many people out there,

2304
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,060
and believe it or not,

2305
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,030
there is peer-reviewed science
on things like eye masks.

2306
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:05,970
Do eye masks improve your
ability to stay asleep?

2307
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:07,440
And indeed, they do,

2308
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,150
provided they are not too tight

2309
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,880
and provided that the room is cool enough.

2310
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,713
Why?

2311
01:23:12,713 --> 01:23:14,550
Well, eye masks cover the
upper half of your face,

2312
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:17,610
which is where glabrous skin is localized.

2313
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:19,290
Remember, palms of the
hands, bottoms of the feet,

2314
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:21,030
glabrous skin on the face.

2315
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,700
So a lot of people who
wear eye masks will wake up

2316
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,620
because they're too warm
if the room is too warm.

2317
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:28,650
So if you're going to use an
eye mask to keep light out,

2318
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:30,120
definitely make sure the room

2319
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,700
and your sleeping environment
and your bed are cool enough

2320
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,320
in order for you to stay asleep.

2321
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,780
In addition, I get a lot of
questions about earplugs.

2322
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,070
Here's the deal with earplugs.

2323
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,990
Some people find that
earplugs are very beneficial

2324
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:43,830
because, of course, they
prevent the entrance of sound

2325
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:45,720
into the ear that could wake us up.

2326
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,640
But some people find that the sound

2327
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,820
of their own beating of their
own heart can be disruptive

2328
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,770
and they get a sort of
humming in their head

2329
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,540
when they have those earplugs in.

2330
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,470
I'm one such person.

2331
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,760
Although, I have family members

2332
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,470
that like using earplugs when they sleep.

2333
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:59,670
So it's really up to you.

2334
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:02,250
You have to see whether
or not those earplugs help

2335
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,660
or disrupt your sleep.

2336
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,250
For me, they're no good.

2337
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,930
For some people, they really enjoy them.

2338
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:08,220
I don't use an eye mask

2339
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:10,010
unless I'm sleeping in a
really bright environment

2340
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,710
or I need to sleep on a plane
and things of that sort.

2341
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,563
Other tools that I'll just mention

2342
01:24:14,563 --> 01:24:17,640
that have peer-reviewed
research to support them.

2343
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,500
Elevating your feet either with a pillow

2344
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,600
or by elevating the end of your bed

2345
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,340
by about three to five degrees

2346
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:26,370
can be really beneficial for
increasing the depth of sleep

2347
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:28,440
because of the so-called
glymphatic washout.

2348
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,780
This is the movement of
and circulation of fluids

2349
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:33,090
in your brain at night

2350
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,530
that lead to more wakefulness

2351
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:36,450
and actually can improve
cognitive function

2352
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:39,270
and a number of other things
related to brain health.

2353
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:40,710
There's one caveat to that.

2354
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:43,050
For people that suffer from acid reflux,

2355
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,960
having your ankles
elevated above your chest

2356
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,610
or above your heart in
the middle of the night

2357
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,890
can actually exacerbate that acid reflux.

2358
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,030
You want to do the opposite.

2359
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:54,090
You want to actually elevate
the head side of your bed

2360
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,560
by about three to five degrees.

2361
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,080
Now, one of the common
causes of sleep disruption

2362
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,900
that has tremendously detrimental effects

2363
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,520
is so-called sleep apnea.

2364
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,160
So this is basically bouts of suffocation

2365
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,350
or lack of oxygenation during sleep.

2366
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:08,910
This is particularly the case

2367
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,500
for people that are very heavyset,

2368
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,060
and that heavyset could be from obesity,

2369
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,550
it could also be heavyset
from having too much muscle.

2370
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:17,010
A lot of people who are
carrying too much muscle

2371
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:19,110
will actually have sleep
apnea without realizing it.

2372
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:21,270
Sleep apnea is actually very dangerous.

2373
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:23,820
It's associated with a number
of cardiovascular issues.

2374
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,410
It's associated with sexual dysfunction.

2375
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,780
It's associated with
issues with cognition.

2376
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,740
Sleep apnea is bad.

2377
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,780
A lot of people will have to use the PAP,

2378
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,610
which is a, it's a device.

2379
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:36,240
It looks like a sort of like
a snorkel mask or a dive mask.

2380
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:40,140
It's a whole apparatus that
people will go to sleep with.

2381
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,650
However, many people can relieve
themselves of sleep apnea

2382
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:44,760
provided it's not too serious

2383
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,500
and can sleep much better,

2384
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,360
in fact, I think all people
can sleep much better,

2385
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,770
if they train themselves

2386
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,260
to be nose breathers while they sleep.

2387
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,880
There are a lot of reasons
to be a nose breather

2388
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,940
unless you are breathing
very hard due to exercise

2389
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,740
or talking or eating.

2390
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,997
That was all covered
in James Nestor's book,

2391
01:26:00,997 --> 01:26:02,910
"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art."

2392
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,830
It's been covered in a
number of different podcasts.

2393
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:07,470
We've talked about it
on this podcast as well.

2394
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:08,880
It's a good idea to be a nose breather

2395
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,470
unless you need to mouth breathe.

2396
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:12,990
And it's a great idea, it's a superb idea,

2397
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:15,990
to be a nose breather in sleep.

2398
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,600
And one way to really get good at that

2399
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,080
is to take a little bit of medical tape

2400
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,360
and to tape your mouth
shut before going to sleep.

2401
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,193
You heard me right.

2402
01:26:22,193 --> 01:26:23,820
Put some medical tape over your mouth

2403
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,070
and force yourself to
nose breathe during sleep.

2404
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:28,830
It also prevents snoring in most cases.

2405
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:31,650
Really offsets sleep apnea.

2406
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:34,890
Sleep apnea, again, being a
very serious health concern.

2407
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,780
I should also mention as a tool

2408
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:39,930
that if you have a hard time
being a nose breather in sleep,

2409
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:42,480
you can try doing your
cardiovascular exercise,

2410
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,270
at least the lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise,

2411
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:47,490
through purely nasal breathing.

2412
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,950
And one way to do that, again,
is to tape your mouth shut

2413
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:51,180
or put a gulp of water in your mouth,

2414
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:54,330
but don't actually swallow
that mouth full of water,

2415
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,040
or to use a mouthpiece

2416
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,170
or just deliberately
keep your mouth closed

2417
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,000
and insist on breathing through your nose.

2418
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,833
Most people find

2419
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:02,940
that when they start doing
cardiovascular exercise that way,

2420
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,950
it's really challenging at first,

2421
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,440
but over time, they
actually can feel quite calm

2422
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,990
and still can generate
a lot of physical effort

2423
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:11,390
purely using nose breathing.

2424
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,830
The reason that doing nose breathing

2425
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,270
during cardiovascular exercise

2426
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:17,640
translates to being a
nose breather during sleep

2427
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,030
is that your sinuses actually
can dilate, they're plastic,

2428
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,863
and over time,

2429
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:25,230
plastic meaning they're malleable that is,

2430
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:26,670
and they can become wider.

2431
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:28,530
You're not going to get giant
nostrils. Don't worry about it.

2432
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:31,380
Your airways within your skull,

2433
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,060
'cause that's what the sinuses really are,

2434
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,830
these little passages within the skull,

2435
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:36,750
and, of course, within the nasal passages,

2436
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,910
will dilate and will allow you

2437
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:40,260
to breathe more easily through your nose.

2438
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,370
But for those of you

2439
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:42,960
that are waking up in
the middle of the night

2440
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,910
breathing on your back [breathing heavily]

2441
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,200
or your partner is telling you that

2442
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,300
or other people are telling you that

2443
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,540
or you're that person on the plane

2444
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,220
with your mouth hanging open and drooling

2445
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,870
and your mouth breathing,

2446
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:53,970
terrible, terrible,
terrible for health reasons

2447
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:54,810
and other reasons,

2448
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:56,490
put some a medical tape over your mouth,

2449
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:58,290
learn to be a nose breather during sleep.

2450
01:27:58,290 --> 01:27:59,520
Your sleep will improve

2451
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,230
and your daytime feelings

2452
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:02,910
of wakefulness and focus will improve,

2453
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,130
your cardiovascular health will improve,

2454
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:06,210
and on and on and on.

2455
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:08,940
So now we've largely covered
the tools that one could use

2456
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,740
to get and stay asleep,

2457
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:11,820
and we talked about exercise,

2458
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:12,750
we talked about temperature,

2459
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,580
we talked about supplements,

2460
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,510
and we talked about, of course,

2461
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,220
keeping the sleeping environment

2462
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:20,820
both cool and as dark as possible.

2463
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:24,360
I do want to mention a
couple of broad contour tools

2464
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,070
that will impact your ability

2465
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:28,590
to sleep really well on a consistent basis

2466
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:30,780
and the one that impacts
the most number of people

2467
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,000
is weekends.

2468
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,640
Turns out that most
everybody feels the impulse

2469
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,900
to sleep in on the weekend,

2470
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,970
especially if they've been
out late the night before.

2471
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:40,740
However, the data show

2472
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:44,280
that keeping relatively
consistent sleep and wake times

2473
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,630
is really going to enhance

2474
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:47,880
the quality and depth of your sleep.

2475
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,010
So if you stay out late one night,

2476
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,300
sure, you might allow yourself

2477
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,920
to sleep in an extra hour or so,

2478
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,790
but you should really try
to avoid sleeping in longer

2479
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:00,270
than an hour beyond your
normal wake-up time.

2480
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:01,103
That's right.

2481
01:29:01,103 --> 01:29:02,640
If you normally get eight hours of sleep

2482
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,800
and you wake up at 7:00 a.m.,

2483
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,250
probably okay to wake up
at 8:00 a.m. on the weekend

2484
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,830
or after a night out the night before,

2485
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:13,140
but try not to sleep until 11 or noon

2486
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:15,060
thinking that you're going
to catch up on your sleep

2487
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:17,430
or that's better than waking
up at a consistent time.

2488
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,470
It would be better to wake
up at a consistent time

2489
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,640
plus or minus an hour

2490
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,080
and get a nap in the afternoon

2491
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,140
provided that nap, again, isn't too long.

2492
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,520
And the other tool

2493
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,860
that relates to nights that
you stayed out too late

2494
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,770
or that you feel like you
want to sleep in a bit more

2495
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,603
in the morning

2496
01:29:32,603 --> 01:29:36,150
is if you are going to wake
up at your consistent time.

2497
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:39,180
So for example, normally
you go to bed at 10

2498
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:40,230
and you wake up at six.

2499
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,330
Let's say that's your schedule.

2500
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:44,250
And you end up staying up late one night

2501
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,829
until midnight or one for whatever reason

2502
01:29:46,829 --> 01:29:49,320
and the next morning you wake up at seven

2503
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,643
and you're still groggy.

2504
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,150
In that case, you absolutely want to wait

2505
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:57,480
to ingest caffeine 90 to
120 minutes after waking.

2506
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,540
You really do because there are good data

2507
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:02,913
to support the fact that
caffeine can disrupt sleep.

2508
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:05,010
Yes, that's obvious.

2509
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:06,990
Caffeine especially disrupts sleep

2510
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,910
if you take it too late in the day.

2511
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:11,520
That's very obvious as to
why that would be the case.

2512
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,460
But caffeine especially disrupts

2513
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,650
what's called compensatory sleep.

2514
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:19,560
So if you start changing your waking time

2515
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,940
and your to sleep time

2516
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:23,190
and you start using additional caffeine

2517
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,320
to offset the sleepiness
that you're experiencing

2518
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,820
because of those late nights out,

2519
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,920
well, that's when you
really start to disrupt

2520
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,360
not just your nighttime sleep,

2521
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,610
but your daytime compensatory
sleep, so those naps.

2522
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:36,210
You also are disrupting the
total architecture of sleep

2523
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:37,410
in the early morning hours.

2524
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:40,230
There's a lot of great science
that's been put to this,

2525
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:42,180
or that's emerged from this, I should say.

2526
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:45,390
So try and keep those sleep-wake
times relatively constant

2527
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:46,470
plus or minus an hour,

2528
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:50,430
and try as much as you can
to delay that caffeine intake

2529
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:52,980
90 to 120 minutes after waking every day,

2530
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,230
but especially on days where you wake up

2531
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,610
and you feel you haven't
gotten enough sleep.

2532
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,170
In that case, I highly recommend

2533
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:00,780
you just use NSDR or the Reveri app

2534
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:03,510
or some other form of deep relaxation

2535
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:05,710
to try and compensate
for the lack of sleep,

2536
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:10,590
knowing, of course, that
there's no complete compensation

2537
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,423
for lack of sleep.

2538
01:31:11,423 --> 01:31:12,630
There are just things that we can do

2539
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:14,820
to partially offset lack of sleep.

2540
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:17,280
Now, a couple of final
points and additional tools

2541
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,770
that I think are going to
be useful to everybody,

2542
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:22,710
in particular, people
who have young children

2543
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:25,470
or are following a shift work schedule

2544
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,560
or who are experiencing jet lag.

2545
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,260
Keep in mind, jet lag
can be due to travel,

2546
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,093
which is obvious,

2547
01:31:32,093 --> 01:31:33,570
but jet lag can also be due

2548
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,670
to getting woken up in the
middle of the night, right?

2549
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:36,720
Your body doesn't know the difference

2550
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,850
between flying to a new time zone

2551
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:41,010
and getting woken up in
the middle of the night.

2552
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:42,260
The tool that I'd like to offer you

2553
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:45,240
is an understanding of something
called temperature minimum.

2554
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,950
And I'm going to make
this as simple as possible

2555
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,080
and I'm confident that
everyone can understand this

2556
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,990
even if you don't have
any science background.

2557
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:54,450
Here's the question you
need to ask yourself.

2558
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:58,200
What is your typical wake-up time, okay?

2559
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,310
What's your typical wake-up time?

2560
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,950
If for you, your typical
wake-up time is 7:00 a.m.

2561
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,303
plus or minus half an hour,

2562
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:05,130
and that could be 7:00 a.m.

2563
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:06,450
because you set an alarm clock

2564
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:07,380
or it could be 7:00 a.m.

2565
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,050
because you naturally wake up
at 7:00 a.m., doesn't matter,

2566
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:13,710
if your typical wake-up
time most days is 7:00 a.m.,

2567
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:16,590
well, then your temperature
minimum is 5:00 a.m.

2568
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:18,960
That's right, your temperature
minimum is not a temperature.

2569
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,873
It's a time within your 24-hour cycle.

2570
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:26,130
Approximately two hours before
your typical wake-up time,

2571
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:28,560
your body is at its lowest temperature

2572
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,050
that it will ever be in the 24-hour cycle.

2573
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,450
That's why it's called
your temperature minimum.

2574
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,670
Here's what you need to know
about your temperature minimum.

2575
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:40,620
If you view bright light,
exercise, or drink caffeine

2576
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,240
or all of the above

2577
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:47,240
in the two to four hours before
your temperature minimum,

2578
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,560
that will delay your clock.

2579
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,420
What that means when
I say delay your clock

2580
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,120
is it will make you want
to go to sleep later

2581
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,790
and wake up later the next night, okay?

2582
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:58,770
So let's run this exercise for you,

2583
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:02,040
the person waking up at 7:00
a.m. on a regular basis,

2584
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,470
I can predict with almost certainty

2585
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:07,410
that your body is going to
be at its lowest temperature

2586
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:08,700
at 5:00 a.m..

2587
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:09,960
So what that means

2588
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,460
is that if you get up at
3:00 a.m. or at 4:00 a.m.

2589
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,620
and you flip on bright
lights in your house

2590
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,820
or in your bathroom

2591
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:18,990
or you have a cup of coffee

2592
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,310
or you do any kind of exercise

2593
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:22,770
or you get up and head to the airport,

2594
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:25,260
the mechanisms in your brain and body

2595
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,790
that control timing of sleep

2596
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:28,200
and timing of waking will shift.

2597
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,340
They will delay.

2598
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:32,490
It's as if you put your clock
on hold for a little while

2599
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,170
and then let it start again, okay?

2600
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:35,730
That's the simplest way I can describe it.

2601
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:38,670
And you will tend to
want to go to sleep later

2602
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:41,490
and wake up later the following night.

2603
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:43,650
Now, the opposite is true

2604
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:47,040
if you view bright light, drink caffeine,

2605
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,040
or exercise or socialize, I should say,

2606
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,760
in the hours immediately after
your temperature minimum.

2607
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,620
So for you in this example,

2608
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,450
the person who's waking up at 7:00 a.m.,

2609
01:33:57,450 --> 01:33:59,280
your temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m.,

2610
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,110
if you view bright light, exercise,

2611
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:04,984
maybe have a snack, maybe
not, or socialize, move about,

2612
01:34:04,984 --> 01:34:08,580
at 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.

2613
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:12,330
That will tend to phase
advance your clock.

2614
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:14,400
It will tend to basically make you

2615
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,190
want to go to bed earlier
and wake up earlier

2616
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:18,150
the following night.

2617
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:19,170
Now, I used this example

2618
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:21,390
of a person who wakes up
typically at 7:00 a.m.

2619
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:22,980
whose temperature minimum is 5:00 a.m.,

2620
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:25,710
but, of course, you need
to adjust that for yourself

2621
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:26,607
if you're somebody who
wakes up at 9:00 a.m.

2622
01:34:26,607 --> 01:34:28,710
or at 5:00 a.m. et cetera.

2623
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,060
Why do I offer this as a tool?

2624
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,550
Well, this is an immensely powerful tool

2625
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,740
if, for instance, you
are headed to a time zone

2626
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,030
where you need to go to bed earlier

2627
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:38,730
and wake up earlier once you
arrive in that time zone.

2628
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:41,520
What it means is in the day
or two before you leave,

2629
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,500
you can force yourself to
exercise, drink caffeine,

2630
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,990
maybe even to eat a meal
early in the morning,

2631
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:50,307
or maybe you still fast
early in the morning

2632
01:34:50,307 --> 01:34:51,750
and that's really up to you,

2633
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,540
but you force yourself
to do the activities

2634
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:57,390
that are going to phase
advance your clock.

2635
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,280
Whereas if you're traveling to a time zone

2636
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,130
where you are going to need
to go to sleep much later

2637
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:05,040
and you're going to need
to wake up much later

2638
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,330
or even a little bit later,

2639
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,440
you can do those things

2640
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,740
in the hours prior to
your temperature minimum.

2641
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:12,510
Now, for those of you
that work shift work,

2642
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,340
this can be especially useful,

2643
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,520
but I want to say a couple
of things about shift work.

2644
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,650
There are a lot of details
about shift work and jet lag

2645
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:20,850
in an episode that I did

2646
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,860
specifically about jet lag and shift work.

2647
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,150
So for the deep dive, go there,

2648
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:26,523
but suffice to say this for now,

2649
01:35:27,570 --> 01:35:29,160
if you are going to do shift work,

2650
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:32,040
try to stay on the same shift
for two weeks at a time.

2651
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,350
It's very detrimental to brain and body,

2652
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:37,740
it can even be horrifically challenging

2653
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:39,510
for your brain and body
in a number of ways,

2654
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:42,420
if you are switching on
the so-called swing shift,

2655
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:43,890
you know, you're working
three days the night shift,

2656
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:44,723
three days the day shift,

2657
01:35:44,723 --> 01:35:45,990
three days the night
shift, three days the...

2658
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,020
Try and stay on the same
schedule as much as possible.

2659
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:50,940
And I should say for everybody,

2660
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:54,840
people who are jet lagged and
engaged in shift work or not,

2661
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,920
but just for everybody,

2662
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,700
if you need to be awake in
the middle of your sleep cycle

2663
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,220
and it's not just a quick
departure to the bathroom

2664
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,480
and back to bed,

2665
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,560
but you really need to be awake,

2666
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,790
you know, you're feeding a baby

2667
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:08,160
or you're taking care of a loved one

2668
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,570
or you need to do
something that's critical

2669
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:10,403
or you need to work,

2670
01:36:10,403 --> 01:36:13,020
if possible, use red light, okay?

2671
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,390
Now, for shift workers
who really are trying

2672
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,490
to stay awake all night and sleep all day,

2673
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:18,840
this is not going to be ideal,

2674
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,610
but for people that, for instance,

2675
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:22,020
need to stay up really late one night

2676
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,120
or wake up especially
early, like 3:00 a.m.,

2677
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,520
to prepare for an exam that
you're just not ready for

2678
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:29,340
or to head to the airport, et cetera,

2679
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,080
using red light has been shown

2680
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:33,270
to allow people to be awake enough

2681
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:34,800
and obviously see what they need to see

2682
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,080
in order to perform
their activities safely

2683
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,680
but it does not seem to
disrupt the cortisol rhythm

2684
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,350
that is the healthy,
normal cortisol rhythm.

2685
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,360
Now, I realize this is
kind of an advanced tool

2686
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,920
and many people won't have access to this.

2687
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,040
There are a number of different
sources for red lights now.

2688
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,010
Companies like Joovv or KOZE light.

2689
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:54,120
These are different brands.

2690
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,140
I don't have any affiliation

2691
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,340
to any of these brands, I should say.

2692
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:57,600
There are a number of different

2693
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,230
red light bulb sources out
there and commercial sources

2694
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:02,700
that you can explore if you want.

2695
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,740
But understanding this temperature minimum

2696
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,150
is really powerful

2697
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,920
because it allows you
to adjust your schedule

2698
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,790
depending on travel,

2699
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:11,520
depending on changing work
schedules or school schedules.

2700
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,870
And if you're not a morning person,

2701
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:15,630
you can use the tools related
to temperature minimum

2702
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:18,570
to really become a
morning person over time,

2703
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:20,130
and it actually is pretty easy.

2704
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:22,350
And I talked about this
in a previous episode

2705
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,300
but I'll just mention
that there have been shown

2706
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:27,240
to be important, positive
effects on cognition,

2707
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,670
on even grip strength
and physical performance,

2708
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:32,880
for people that are early morning risers,

2709
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,430
and that's especially true for night owls

2710
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:38,700
that deliberately shift
themselves to become early risers.

2711
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:40,887
Okay, so that's a lot of
information and a lot of tools

2712
01:37:40,887 --> 01:37:42,630
and I suppose the one set of tools

2713
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:45,270
that I really didn't
drill into too deeply,

2714
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:47,070
the ones related to
jet lag and shift work.

2715
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,230
And again, please check out the episode

2716
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:52,140
on jet lag and shift work
if that's relevant to you.

2717
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:55,920
But I think for most people
who are going to sleep at night

2718
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,500
and are trying their best
to sleep well at night

2719
01:37:58,500 --> 01:37:59,550
and are trying their best

2720
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:01,560
to wake up in the morning at whatever hour

2721
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,300
and stay alert and focused
throughout the day,

2722
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:04,830
maybe with a brief nap,

2723
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:06,090
the tools that I talked about today

2724
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:09,060
related to light,
temperature, food, exercise,

2725
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:12,390
caffeine, supplements, and digital tools,

2726
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:15,420
I'm hoping will prove to
be very useful for you.

2727
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,250
They certainly are all supported

2728
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,500
by excellent peer-reviewed research.

2729
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,060
And I should just emphasize again

2730
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,590
that most of the tools we talked about

2731
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,510
are completely zero cost.

2732
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:26,940
So while the supplements and
some of the digital tools

2733
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:29,070
do carry some cost to them,

2734
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,390
I really want to encourage everybody

2735
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:32,250
to get your behaviors right.

2736
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:35,280
Get all of the things related
to your timing of exercise

2737
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,806
and type of exercise

2738
01:38:36,806 --> 01:38:40,170
in the best possible
order and time of day.

2739
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,450
We talked about this critical
period early in the day

2740
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:44,460
and then another critical
period in the middle of the day

2741
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:45,390
and the late afternoon

2742
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:46,590
and then this third critical period

2743
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,550
in the middle of the night.

2744
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:50,395
Different tools for the
different three critical periods.

2745
01:38:50,395 --> 01:38:52,905
I promise that if you
start to implement some,

2746
01:38:52,905 --> 01:38:55,470
or ideally, all of these tools,

2747
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:58,380
the quality of your sleep
will increase tremendously.

2748
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,360
And of course, in doing so,

2749
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,130
the quality of your daytime alertness

2750
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,560
and your ability to focus
will improve tremendously.

2751
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,490
Again, sleep is the absolute foundation

2752
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:10,320
of your mental health,
your physical health,

2753
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,270
and your performance in all endeavors.

2754
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,940
So if there's one area of your life

2755
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:17,700
to really focus on and try and optimize,

2756
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,100
if your goal is to be
happier and more productive

2757
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,950
and just to have a better life overall,

2758
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,360
I can confidently say

2759
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,510
that sleep is really
the thing to optimize.

2760
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:29,610

In addition, please check

2777
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:02,880
at the beginning of today's podcast.

2778
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,550
That's the best way to
support this podcast.

2779
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:06,540
During today's podcast

2780
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,940
and on many previous episodes
of The Huberman Lab Podcast,

2781
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,050
we talked about supplements.

2782
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,210
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

2783
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:14,130
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

2784
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:15,780
for things like sleep and focus

2785
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:17,460
and hormone support and so forth.

2786
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,380
For reasons mentioned at the
beginning of the episode,

2787
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,660
we are now partnered with
Momentous supplements.

2788
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:24,360
If you go to livemomentous.com/huberman,

2789
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,550
you'll see many of the
supplements described on today's

2790
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,890
and other episodes of
The Huberman Lab Podcast.

2791
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:31,260
Again, all as
single-ingredient formulations.

2792
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:32,790
They ship internationally,

2793
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,800
their quality is exceedingly high,

2794
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,730
and by largely focusing
on single ingredient

2795
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:41,550
and various dosages of
different supplements,

2796
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:44,670
you can create the optimized
supplement protocol for you.

2797
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:47,370
If you're not already
following us on social media,

2798
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:49,200
we are @hubermanlab on Instagram

2799
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,180
and also @hubermanlab on Twitter.

2800
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:53,700
There, I cover science
and science-related tools,

2801
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:54,780
some of which overlaps

2802
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,700
with the content of The
Huberman Lab Podcast,

2803
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,840
and other of which,

2804
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:58,710
I should say much of which,

2805
01:40:58,710 --> 01:41:01,500
is distinct from the information
covered on this podcast.

2806
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,750
If you're interested
in obtaining protocols

2807
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,760
or summaries from these podcasts,

2808
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,680
you can get those completely free of cost

2809
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,150
by going to hubermanlab.com.

2810
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:11,250
Go to the menu at hubermanlab.com.

2811
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,900
Go to the Neural Network Newsletter.

2812
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,970
You simply provide us your email

2813
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:16,530
and you'll get the
Neural Network Newsletter

2814
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:17,880
for free each month.

2815
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,860
You can also find previous newsletters

2816
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,883
there at hubermanlab.com.

2817
01:41:21,883 --> 01:41:24,060
For instance, Toolkit for Sleep

2818
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:26,490
or Deliberate Cold Exposure
and so on and so forth.

2819
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:28,890
Again, we don't share
your email with anybody.

2820
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:31,350
So our privacy policy is
made very clear there.

2821
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:33,000
And it's completely zero cost.

2822
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,130
So thank you for joining
me today for our discussion

2823
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,110
about tools for optimizing sleep,

2824
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:41,370
and in doing so, tools for
optimizing not just sleep,

2825
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:44,340
but your daytime feelings
of alertness and focus

2826
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,810
and your overall health.

2827
01:41:45,810 --> 01:41:47,910
And last but certainly not least,

2828
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,667
thank you for your interest in science.

2829
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:52,250
