1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,950
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,362
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:09,360
[bright music]

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,180
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,160
Today, we are discussing cannabis,

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,500
also referred to as marijuana.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,487
Cannabis includes many different compounds

10
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:25,020
that have profound impact
on the brain and body,

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,750
so while many of you have
probably heard of THC,

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,140
there are also compounds
in cannabis such as CBD,

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,670
and of course there are different types

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,840
or strains of cannabis,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,450
including sativa strains
and indica strains

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,940
and hybrid strains, and believe it or not,

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,940
nowadays, there is also
an entire literature,

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,010
meaning a scientific
and medicinal literature

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,200
about type one, type two
and type three strains.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,020
I'll explain what all of
that is and how they work.

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,270
I'll talk about some of
the medicinal applications

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,770
of different strains of cannabis

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,900
and combinations of cannabis strains,

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,600
as well as some of the
potential health hazards

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
of cannabis use.

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
I want to emphasize that any
discussion about cannabis

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,180
has to be framed within the context

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,020
that the legality of
cannabis varies tremendously

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,490
depending on where you are in the world,

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,160
so depending on which country you're in

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,480
and even which state you're in

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,384
or which area within a country,

33
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:17,430
possessing and using and
certainly selling cannabis

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,490
can be either highly
illegal or entirely legal

35
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,280
or decriminalized or largely overlooked.

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,440
You, of course, are obligated to know

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,247
what those local laws are for you,

38
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:30,030
where you live and where you travel.

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,340
With that said, today's discussion

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,100
really will include a full picture

41
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,400
as to where cannabis and the various

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,440
and even very specific
compounds within cannabis

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,190
can be extremely useful in
the treatment of some ailments

44
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,830
and where certain compounds in cannabis

45
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,250
can be extremely dangerous for
certain individuals to use,

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,231
in particular, individuals
that have preexisting,

47
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,220
genetic propensity for psychosis.

48
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,930
That theme is going to
come up again and again,

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,450
but we are also going to talk
about the role of cannabis

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,760
in anxiety and depression,

51
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,470
both positive and negative effects.

52
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,700
We'll talk about sex differences

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,160
in terms of women versus men

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
and how they react
differently to cannabis,

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,550
and I would be entirely remiss

56
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,520
if I didn't include a
conversation about cannabis,

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,850
meaning THC, CBD, hybrid
strains, et cetera

58
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,490
in creativity and different
modes of thinking,

59
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,620
because as many of you probably know

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,570
or at least have heard about,

61
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,270
cannabis can impact the way that we think,

62
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,490
the types of memory systems we can access

63
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,380
and what's called convergent
and divergent thinking,

64
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,720
which is one way of conceptualizing

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,870
what is commonly referred
to as creativity.

66
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,270
So today's discussion is going to include

67
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,470
a lot of information,

68
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,960
but I promise to make it clear
and accessible to all of you,

69
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,790
regardless of whether or
not you have a background

70
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,350
in biology or not,

71
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,380
and today's discussion
will also be quite nuanced.

72
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,180
You'll find me routinely reading

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
directly from specific research papers,

74
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,252
something that of course we
always do on this podcast,

75
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:57,960
but today I'm really going to dig

76
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,440
into some of the finer points
of the methodology in papers

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,810
and some of the statistics that were used

78
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,660
and the specific populations
of people that were studied,

79
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,920
because as it turns out,

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,750
there are instances that we will discuss

81
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,170
in which the use of cannabis
can be immensely beneficial

82
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,590
to one group and yet can
be entirely detrimental

83
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,097
to another group, even
at equivalent dosages

84
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,600
and depending on a number
of different factors,

85
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,820
so we will discuss what those factors are.

86
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,560
Just to give you a brief overview

87
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
of the kind of structure I'm
going to put on today's episode,

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,470
we will review of course,
cannabis and its various forms.

89
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,550
I'll talk about some of the biology,

90
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,150
but we are going to really
drill into how dosage,

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,461
that is the concentration
of THC relative to CBD,

92
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,700
impacts whether or not cannabis

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,140
is going to have one effect or another.

94
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,320
We will also talk about
the frequency of use,

95
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,080
daily use, multiple times per day use,

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,510
weekly use or monthly or occasional use.

97
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,640
We will also talk about
different professions

98
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,860
and how some people may have
a little bit more leeway

99
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,620
in terms of whether or not
they decide to use cannabis

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,310
or any of its various component
chemical constituents,

101
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,920
that is CBD or THC, et cetera.

102
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,720
And for other professions,

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,310
it might be entirely inappropriate

104
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,650
because of the particular
kinds of cognitive tasks

105
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,120
those professions demand.

106
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,760
We will also talk about
genetic predisposition,

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,540
again, sex differences, hormone effects,

108
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,329
and I will also touch on what I think

109
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,249
is the most important variable

110
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,620
in determining whether or not cannabis

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,000
is right or wrong for
you, and that is your age

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,740
at which you are considering starting

113
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,230
or continuing use or ceasing use.

114
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,110
What I can assure you is that
by the end of today's podcast,

115
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,410
you will have a quite thorough
understanding of cannabis,

116
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,090
how it works, what it does,

117
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,950
what its potential benefits can be,

118
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,050
what its potential hazards are,

119
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,850
and whether or not it's right for you

120
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,020
and the people that you know.

121
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,090
I'm excited to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast

122
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,950
has now launched a premium channel.

123
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,810
The purpose of the premium
channel is severalfold.

124
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,510
First of all, I will be
hosting regular AMAs,

125
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,760
Ask Me Anythings, where
you can ask me anything,

126
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,710
and I will provide answers in depth

127
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,480
to your specific questions about science

128
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,700
and science related
tools for mental health,

129
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,470
physical health and performance.

130
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,780
Now, there is a nominal
cost to the premium channel.

131
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,500
It's $10 per month, or you can
pay $100 for the entire year.

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,180
I should mention, however,

133
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,830
that a significant portion of the funds

134
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,510
raised through the premium channel

135
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,880
are going to support not just
the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"

136
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,540
which we will continue to
release every Monday on schedule

137
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,780
of zero cost to all consumers' content

138
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,390
on mental health, physical
health and performance,

139
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,970
but proceeds from the premium channel

140
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,890
will also be used to fund research,

141
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,930
in particular research
done on human beings,

142
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,000
so not animal models, but on human beings,

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
which I think we all agree is a species

144
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,990
that we are most interested in.

145
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,990
And, we are going to
specifically fund research

146
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,630
that is aimed toward
developing further protocols

147
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,670
for mental health, physical
health and performance,

148
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,560
and those protocols will be distributed

149
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,960
through all channels, not
just the premium channel,

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,793
but through all channels,

151
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,990
Huberman Lab Podcast and
other media channels.

152
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,570
So the idea here is to
give you information

153
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,760
to your burning questions in depth

154
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,260
and allow you the opportunity

155
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,940
to support the kind of research

156
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,670
that provides those kinds of
answers in the first place.

157
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,674
Now, an especially exciting
feature of the premium channel

158
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:10,980
is that the Tiny Foundation
has generously offered

159
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,600
to do a dollar-for-dollar match

160
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,520
on all funds raised for research

161
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,260
through the premium channel.

162
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,870
So this is a terrific way
that they're going to amplify

163
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,850
whatever funds come in
through the premium channel

164
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,890
to further support research for science

165
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,970
and science-related tools

166
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,190
for mental health, physical
health and performance.

167
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,023
If you'd like to sign up

168
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,800
for the Huberman Lab premium channel,

169
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,870
again, there's a cost of $10 per month

170
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,630
or you can pay $100 upfront
for the entire year.

171
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,970
That will give you access to all the AMAs.

172
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,850
You can ask questions and get
answers to your questions,

173
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,430
and you'll of course get
answers to all the questions

174
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,810
that other people ask as well.

175
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,760
There will also be some premium content,

176
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,590
such as transcripts of the AMAs

177
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,480
and various transcripts and protocols

178
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,720
of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes
and not found elsewhere.

179
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,714
And again, you'll be supporting research

180
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,370
for mental health, physical
health and performance.

181
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,780
You can sign up for the premium channel

182
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,480
by going to hubermanlab.com/premium,

183
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,330
again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.

184
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,300
Before diving into all of that,
I'd like to highlight a new,

185
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,140
what I think is a very useful
and zero cost resource.

186
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,620
This resource is what's
called Non-Sleep Deep Rest

187
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,750
or NSDR protocol.

188
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,000
I've talked many times before
on the Huberman Lab Podcast

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,334
about Non-Sleep Deep Rest, AKA, NSDR.

190
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,710
NSDR is sort of an umbrella term

191
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,700
for a variety of different practices,

192
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,200
so these are behavioral practices

193
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,540
that allow you to direct
your brain and body

194
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,410
into a particular state,
and most typically,

195
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,210
that state is one of deep relaxation,

196
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,080
but also one in which you
can access your bodily

197
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,900
and brain systems for teaching yourself

198
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,539
how to relax in real
time and how to recover

199
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:49,650
some of the sleep that you
may not be getting at night,

200
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,230
and to restore levels of dopamine

201
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,210
in particular areas of the
brain that are involved

202
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,000
in motivation and cognitive
and motor control.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,360
Basically, NSDR is a
wonderfully restorative tool.

204
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,670
This has been demonstrated
many times over now

205
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,290
through quality peer-reviewed science,

206
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,000
and there are neurochemical benefits,

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,080
and there are physical benefits,

208
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,600
and there are certainly
psychological benefits.

209
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,096
I highly recommend NSDR to anybody

210
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,670
that has trouble falling asleep

211
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,080
or that wakes up in
the middle of the night

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,060
and needs to get better
at falling back asleep,

213
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,280
as well as to anyone out
there that has issues

214
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,770
with anxiety or
self-regulation of any kind.

215
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,630
And if you don't have any of those issues,

216
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,150
it's also immensely beneficial
just as a restorative

217
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,340
for leaning back into
focused work of any kind.

218
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,690
Now, a number of people have reached out

219
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,909
about finding NSDR protocols,
and there are a number

220
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,029
of different good ones
out there floating around.

221
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,712
I've decided to put a
zero-cost NSDR script

222
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,070
out there on the internet
for people to access,

223
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,780
so you can find it by going to YouTube

224
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,500
and simply put my last
name, 'Huberman' and 'NSDR'

225
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,120
into the search function.

226
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,850
This is a YouTube channel
that's hosted by Virtusan,

227
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,827
which has a terrific
app that includes NSDR

228
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:55,740
and a number of other health
and wellness protocols,

229
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,820
but they've been quite generous

230
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,000
in hosting a 10 minute NSDR, read by me.

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,980
This NSDR is distinct from,

232
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,320
although I should say,
similar to yoga nidra,

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,420
which some of you are familiar with.

234
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,150
This NSDR is different than yoga nidra

235
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,190
in the sense that it
doesn't have intentions.

236
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,600
There's no mystical component,

237
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,790
and I describe a little bit of the science

238
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,460
and why specific components
of the NSDR are included,

239
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,050
things like long exhale breathing,

240
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,610
I talk about perceptual shifts

241
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,680
and how to move from thinking and planning

242
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,790
to pure sensation.

243
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,290
If none of that makes sense right now,

244
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,380
it'll make total sense after
listening to the NSDR script.

245
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,673
Again, it's a 10 minute
NSDR script, read by me.

246
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,350
You can do this first thing in
the morning when you wake up,

247
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,330
especially if you didn't
get enough sleep that night,

248
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,220
and you're feeling a little bit fatigued,

249
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,260
and you need to lean into
the day with full vigor.

250
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,120
You could do it at any
point during the day

251
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,470
or if you wake up in
the middle of the night.

252
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,020
Again, this is a zero-cost
resource for you.

253
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,340
You can find it by going to YouTube,

254
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,710
put my last name in and NSDR.

255
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,500
I encourage you to try
it, and if you like it

256
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,990
or frankly, if you don't,
you can just put that

257
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,910
in the comment section there on YouTube,

258
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,610
and I've put it there as
a free resource to you,

259
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,808
so that you can benefit
from the research-backed,

260
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:05,220
peer-reviewed studies that point to NSDR

261
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,500
as a very useful practice.

262
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,960
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

263
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,720
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

264
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

265
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
to bring zero-cost to consumer information

266
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,810
about science and science-related tools

267
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,220
to the general public.

268
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,270
In keeping with that theme,

269
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,970
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

270
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,560
Our first sponsor is Levels.

271
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,570
Levels is a program that lets you see

272
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,010
how different foods affect your health

273
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,170
by giving you real-time
feedback on your diet

274
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,660
using a continuous glucose monitor.

275
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,980
One of the most important factors

276
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,503
in your immediate and long-term health

277
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,060
is how well you're
managing your blood glucose

278
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,080
or blood sugar.

279
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,910
I started using Levels about a year ago

280
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,440
as a way to see how different foods

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,420
and different lifestyle factors

282
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,790
were impacting my blood glucose levels.

283
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,070
So for instance, it allowed
me to see how different foods

284
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,510
and particular macronutrients

285
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,460
and combinations of macronutrients

286
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,030
would either peak or trough my blood sugar

287
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,100
or keep my blood sugar steady.

288
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,077
It also allowed me to see how working out

289
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,380
with weights or running, how
that impacted my blood glucose.

290
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,533
So for me, it was a fascinating
experiment unto myself

291
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,420
as to how my meal schedule, the
specific foods I was eating,

292
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,730
different combinations of
food, as I mentioned before,

293
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,880
and exercise were combining to regulate

294
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,290
this thing that we call blood sugar

295
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,880
and that's so vital to our health.

296
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,190
I think anyone that tries Levels will find

297
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,710
that you learn an immense
amount about what you're doing

298
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,270
and what you ought to be doing differently

299
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,240
in order to optimize your
immediate feelings of wellbeing

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,740
and your health trajectory.

301
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,390
If you're interested in
learning more about Levels

302
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,380
and trying a CGM yourself,
go to levels.link/huberman,

303
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,160
that's levels.link, L-I-N-K, /huberman.

304
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,620
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.

305
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,180
Thesis makes custom nootropics

306
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,776
that are designed for
your particular needs.

307
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,950
I am not a fan of the word nootropics,

308
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,169
because nootropics
literally means smart drugs

309
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,990
or smart drug, and frankly,
as a neuroscientist,

310
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,500
I know and every other
neuroscientist knows

311
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,330
that there is no neural circuit

312
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,790
or chemical in the brain for being smart.

313
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,760
There are, for instance,
neural circuits and chemicals

314
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,800
that increase your ability to focus

315
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,900
or your ability to task switch.

316
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,580
Thesis understands this and therefore,

317
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,340
has designed custom nootropics that vary

318
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,590
and are tailored to you
so that, for instance,

319
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,630
if you want to achieve focus and clarity

320
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,610
for one particular type of work,

321
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,050
there is a Nootropic for that.

322
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,980
Or if you'd like to have more
energy and have more focus,

323
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,780
there's a different Nootropic for that.

324
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,280
If you'd like to get your own personalized

325
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,270
nootropics starter kit,

326
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,570
you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman,

327
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,650
take that three minute quiz,

328
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,510
and Thesis will send you
four different formulas

329
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,710
to try in your first month,

330
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,360
and then they'll work with you and iterate

331
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,910
to find the best formulas
for you to take ongoing.

332
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,610
Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

333
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,530
and use the code 'huberman' at checkout

334
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,720
to get 10% off your first box.

335
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,404
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

336
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,210
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

337
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,850
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

338
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,470
to help you better understand your body

339
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,450
and help you reach your health goals.

340
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,270
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

341
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,160
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

342
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,200
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

343
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,900
can only be analyzed with
a quality blood test.

344
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,540
With a lot of blood tests and
DNA tests out there, however,

345
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,370
an issue is you get information back

346
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,830
about lipids and hormones, et cetera,

347
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,450
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

348
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,684
With InsideTracker, they
have a personalized platform

349
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:23,100
that makes interpreting your data

350
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,650
and then acting on that
data very straightforward

351
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,350
and very directed toward
specific protocols.

352
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,600
What I mean by that is
you'll get information back

353
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
about hormone levels
and metabolic factors,

354
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,190
lipids, et cetera, and then you can look

355
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,656
to nutritional changes,
supplementation changes,

356
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:41,910
exercise protocol changes
and other lifestyle features

357
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,160
that combine or work on their own

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,780
to start to try and shift those numbers

359
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,940
into the range that's appropriate for you.

360
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,320

366
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,290
On many episodes of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

367
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,820
we talk about supplements.

368
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,950
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

369
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,500
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,

370
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,110
things like enhancing sleep
and the depth of sleep,

371
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,840
or for enhancing focus
and cognitive ability,

372
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,792
or for enhancing energy or
adjusting hormone levels

373
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,730
to optimal range for you.

374
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,680
The Huberman Lab Podcast

375
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,790
is now partnered with
Momentous Supplements.

376
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,810
We partnered with Momentous

377
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,460
for a number of important reasons.

378
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,541
First of all, the quality
of their ingredients

379
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,170
is exceptional, it's
really second to none.

380
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,970
Second of all, they ship internationally,

381
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,020
and that was important to us,

382
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,780
because a number of you reside
outside of the United States.

383
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,929
Third, we've worked with
Momentous very closely

384
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,730
to develop single-ingredient formulations.

385
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,620
Now, this turns out to be very important,

386
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,437
because if you're going
to take supplements,

387
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:48,240
you want to know what's
working for you and what isn't.

388
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,420
And of course, you want to
optimize the cost efficiency

389
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,480
and the biological efficiency
of those supplements.

390
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,800
To find the supplements we discuss

391
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

392
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,670
you can go to livemomentous spelled O-U-S,

393
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,950
livemomentous.com/huberman,

394
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,600
and I should just mention that the library

395
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,790
of those supplements is
constantly expanding.

396
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,910
Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.

397
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,420
Let's talk about cannabis,
and when we refer to cannabis,

398
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,780
we are indeed referring to
marijuana or the marijuana plant.

399
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,070
Now, cannabis plants
come in different strains

400
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,320
or different varieties,
and those different strains

401
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,893
are indeed different genetic strains.

402
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,970
So just as animals and humans

403
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,560
have different genetic backgrounds,

404
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,180
and they can be crossed to one another

405
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,830
to yield further genetic
variation in the offspring,

406
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,171
plants can be hybridized to one another

407
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,600
in various ways through grafting

408
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
or through the use of different
types of seed combinations,

409
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,270
et cetera, in order to
generate different strains.

410
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,850
There are also naturally
occurring differences

411
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,560
in the strains of plants,

412
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,530
and the cannabis plant is no exception.

413
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,570
So for instance, in the context

414
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,250
of the discussion about cannabis

415
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,195
and its medicinal uses
and recreational uses,

416
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:03,512
we need to distinguish
between the sativa variety,

417
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:08,430
the indica variety, a
variety called ruderalis

418
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,140
that's not often discussed,

419
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,010
and hybrids of sativa,
indica and ruderalis.

420
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,050
Before diving into the
different strains of cannabis

421
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,520
and how they impact the brain embody,

422
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,610
both similarly and differently,

423
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,920
I want to emphasize
that the cannabis plant

424
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,250
contains a number of different
psychoactive compounds.

425
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,060
Now, the most powerful of
those compounds is THC.

426
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,779
The technical name for it is
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.

427
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:37,980
But THC, as I'll refer to it,

428
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,230
is just one of the psychoactive

429
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,263
and biologically active
compounds within cannabis plants.

430
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,780
There's also CBD, which
is technically referred to

431
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,923
as cannabidiol, and cannabidiol, CBD,

432
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:56,670
is known to be used for
things like pain management,

433
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,610
anxiety management and
other medicinal purposes.

434
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,090
We will talk about the efficacy
of CBD for those purposes,

435
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,859
as well as some of, believe it or not,

436
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,232
some of the dangers of CBD,

437
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,183
depending on where it's sourced
and the dosage, et cetera.

438
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,380
So we've got THC, CBD and
also CBN or cannabinol.

439
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:18,389
CBN is less often discussed.

440
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,650
You're going to hear a lot less

441
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,488
about CBN containing products out there,

442
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,150
CBN containing medicines,

443
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,480
but it is relevant to today's discussion,

444
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,089
so it will come up a bit.

445
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,400
Now, I will be sure to
provide more specificity

446
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,125
to what I'm about to say,
but very broadly speaking,

447
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,670
THC is largely responsible

448
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,733
for the psychoactive effects of cannabis,

449
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,090
that is the changes in mood,
the changes in bodily state

450
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,700
and sensation, et cetera.

451
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,280
Whereas CBD and to some extent,

452
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,200
CBN, have profound effects
on the brain and body,

453
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,420
but they don't tend to
give people the sensation

454
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,110
of altered perception,
altered mood, et cetera.

455
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,685
Some people might say they are
not the component of cannabis

456
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:03,150
that, quote unquote, gets you high,

457
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,680
although today, we will really drill into

458
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,720
what the high itself represents

459
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,390
in terms of chemical
systems in the brain body.

460
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,026
And what we will soon learn is that

461
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:15,810
what we think of as being
high actually includes

462
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,880
a number of different changes
in the brain and body,

463
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,030
some of which can be
best explained by CBD,

464
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,400
not by THC, which runs counter

465
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,430
to what most people out
there know and believe.

466
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,900
So broadly speaking, we
have THC, CBD and CBN.

467
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,180
But I want to point out
that the cannabis plant

468
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,122
has over 70, seven-zero,

469
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:37,290
70 different psychoactive compounds,

470
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,140
many of which still have not been studied

471
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,180
in isolation and in detail.

472
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,799
So there's a big future
of research for cannabis

473
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,360
and for THC and THC-related
psychoactive compounds,

474
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,790
as well as for CBD and CBN.

475
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,189
Today we're mainly going to focus

476
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:55,650
on THC and CBD, as I mentioned before.

477
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,360
I should also point out
that the cannabis plant

478
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,797
has over 400 biologically
active compounds.

479
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:02,715
So these are biologically active compounds

480
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:06,690
that may or may not have
psychoactive properties,

481
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,480
that may or may not be useful
for pain relief, et cetera.

482
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,810
Again, there is a vast
landscape for exploration

483
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,285
of the cannabis plant and of
hemp for what they include

484
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:20,040
that could be beneficial
to us or detrimental to us,

485
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,840
so again, a lot more work to do.

486
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,910
Today, we're going to really
try and stay on target

487
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,770
with what we already know

488
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,974
and where there are
certain exciting mysteries

489
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,490
or intriguing mysteries

490
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,530
about what we ought to explore more.

491
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,180
I will certainly highlight those.

492
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,090
Let's go back to the different strains

493
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,831
of the cannabis plant,
sativa, indica and ruderalis

494
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:41,670
and explore how each of those

495
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,520
differentially impacts the brain and body,

496
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,590
because therein I think
we can start to learn

497
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,600
a lot about this incredible plant

498
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,310
that is the cannabis plant.

499
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,160
And whether or not you
are a user of cannabis

500
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,490
or whether or not you are
entirely opposed to cannabis use,

501
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,500
understanding how cannabis works

502
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,620
in the brain and body, itself,
is absolutely fascinating

503
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,830
and can teach you a lot about
how your brain and body work

504
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,890
at a basic level and
can tell you a lot about

505
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,290
how your brain and body will
react to different life events

506
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,260
and how your mood is
established and stabilized,

507
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,896
and how your appetite is
established and stabilized

508
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,190
and so on.

509
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,140
So we have the three
major strains of cannabis,

510
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,930
sativa, indica and ruderalis.

511
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,700
And for sake of today's conversation,

512
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,040
we can pretty much cross off ruderalis.

513
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,260
It's not often consumed,

514
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,310
and components of ruderalis
are not often consumed

515
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,383
for medicinal or recreational purposes.

516
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,593
Let's focus on sativa and indica.

517
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,960
People will consume the
sativa variety of cannabis

518
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,310
either by edible or by smoking cannabis,

519
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,040
or they will consume the
indica variety of cannabis,

520
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,400
again by edible or by smoking cannabis,

521
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,370
or sometimes they will take
it in a transdermal form

522
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,380
or a sublingual form.

523
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,520
There are a bunch of different ways

524
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,520
to get the cannabis into the body,

525
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,330
but there's a clear distinction
between sativa and indica

526
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,509
that actually shows up first
in the structure of the plant.

527
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,160
At their extremes, meaning
in a pure strain of sativa,

528
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,710
it tends to be a taller
plant, a longer stock,

529
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,670
believe it or not,

530
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,820
and actually the length of the
leaves is quite a bit longer,

531
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,558
whereas the indica plant tends
to be more short and stout.

532
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,900
And, for those aficionados out there,

533
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,880
I'm sure you know a lot of
the other specific features

534
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,320
of sativa versus indica,

535
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,380
but already what we're talking
about is the same plant,

536
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,310
cannabis, with two very
different morphologies or shapes.

537
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,087
You might say, "Well, why is
this interesting or important

538
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:42,652
"to how it affects me
or affects other people

539
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:44,850
"for medicinal or recreational purposes?"

540
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,730
Well, it turns out that even
though they are the same plant,

541
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,339
these two different genetic varieties,

542
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,740
because of the way that they grow

543
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,330
and the way they capture sunlight

544
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,191
and the way, believe it or
not, that the different plants

545
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,820
within that strain
interact with one another,

546
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,960
'cause believe it or not,

547
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,970
plants are interacting with one another,

548
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,920
they actually bring different elements

549
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,320
of the psychoactive compounds
to different components

550
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,370
within the leaves and the so-called buds.

551
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,630
The takeaway is that when consumed,

552
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,520
and when I say consumed,
I want to be very clear,

553
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,910
I don't necessarily just
mean oral consumption

554
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,080
or eating cannabis sativa by edible,

555
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I also mean smoking it,
and that could be...

556
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,780
people will, just like with tobacco,

557
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,270
the way that they bring
the psychoactive components

558
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,730
into their bloodstream and
into their brain and body

559
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,300
is to essentially heat the dried leaves

560
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,640
of the cannabis plant.

561
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,750
Then the heat liberates some
of the psychoactive components

562
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,610
that when inhaled into the lungs,

563
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,890
because the lungs include
a lot of vasculature,

564
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,430
a lot of basically blood
vessels and capillaries,

565
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,730
that the psychoactive components

566
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,990
are actually directly absorbed

567
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,490
from the lungs into the bloodstream,

568
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,080
and they can cross into the bloodstream

569
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,300
and permeate throughout the body

570
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,280
and cross the so-called
blood brain barrier.

571
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,840
So in other words, burning
the plant liberates the smoke

572
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,690
that contains the psychoactive compounds,

573
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,550
and those are inhaled into the lungs

574
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,170
and then get into the brain and body

575
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,610
and act on the brain and body.

576
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,250
And the major effect of sativa varieties

577
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,980
are to create a high, if you will,

578
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,030
and I'm putting this in air quotes

579
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,470
for those of you that are listening,

580
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,480
but to also act as a stimulant.

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,310
The sativa varieties tend to make people

582
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,070
feel invigorated, somewhat alert.

583
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,080
It doesn't tend to be
as much of a sedative

584
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,760
as some of the other varieties.

585
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,190
Some people report
heightened sense of focus

586
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,720
or heightened sense of creativity.

587
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,920
We'll talk a little bit later on

588
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,270
as to whether or not they actually

589
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,790
are achieving heightened
levels of focus and creativity,

590
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,500
or whether or not they
just perceive themselves

591
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,327
to have heightened levels
of focus and creativity.

592
00:23:45,327 --> 00:23:47,910
The sativa varieties tend to make people

593
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,550
feel a little bit less susceptible

594
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,800
to pain and noxious stimuli,

595
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,950
which are basically stimuli
that you don't like.

596
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,950
So the sativa varieties are
often prescribed or are used

597
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,220
in the recreational context
for pain management and relief.

598
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,620
Basically, the sativa variety is known

599
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,500
to include a head biased effect.

600
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,960
So here, we're talking
about subjective effects,

601
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,220
and of course these will vary

602
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,020
from one individual to the next.

603
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,080
Some people will smoke cannabis sativa

604
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,320
or ingest cannabis sativa orally

605
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,450
and will feel an entirely
different array of effects,

606
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,460
but most people, the majority of people

607
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,288
experience a head-centered
high, alertness, focus

608
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:33,060
and a sense that they're more creative.

609
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,330
Contrast that with the
indica varieties of cannabis,

610
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,980
and when people smoke or eat
or ingest indica varieties,

611
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,140
the psychoactive components of indica,

612
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,670
and again, this is pure indica,

613
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,850
so not hybridized with sativa
at all, but just pure indica,

614
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,090
tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.

615
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,380
People report feeling more
complete, full-body relaxation,

616
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,600
more of a sedative effect.

617
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
Indica cannabis is often prescribed

618
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
and/or used recreationally

619
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,890
in order to achieve a state of sleep

620
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,300
or to help relieve anxiety,
so less of a stimulant effect.

621
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,040
And we will talk about why,

622
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,538
literally, the underlying neural circuits

623
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:16,350
that lead to the sativa
variety causing more

624
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,800
of a elevated mood and a
head high, if you will,

625
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,040
and the indica variety as being
more full body relaxation.

626
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,450
One of the ways to
remember the distinction

627
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,600
between the effects of cannabis
sativa and cannabis indica

628
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,630
was relayed to me by a friend
who actually was a chronic,

629
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,830
meaning every day, all
day, consumer of marijuana.

630
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,720
He basically smoked marijuana for 20 years

631
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,030
before quitting about
four or five years ago,

632
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,270
and he said that indica
is often referred to

633
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,900
as 'in-da-couch,' meaning
laid back in the couch.

634
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,610
And that can help you remember

635
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,423
that the indica varieties of cannabis

636
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,847
do tend to be more
sedative in their effects.

637
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,570
Okay, so there's sativa
and there's indica,

638
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,790
and then now there are hybrid strains.

639
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,240
So marijuana growers and
people who specialize

640
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,469
in creating novel varieties
of the cannabis plant,

641
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:05,820
again, I'm using the words
cannabis and marijuana

642
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,040
more or less interchangeably here,

643
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,240
they are very good at
creating new strains of plant

644
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,240
that might be 25% sativa and
75% indica or vice versa,

645
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,548
or 50/50 or 90/10.

646
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:21,660
Essentially, what's happening nowadays

647
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,370
is that through plant biology,
plant genetics, I should say,

648
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,010
growers are getting quite efficient

649
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,590
at creating a variety of different strains

650
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,880
of the marijuana plant that
give rise to very nuanced

651
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,090
and distinct effects on brain and body.

652
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,690
In fact, so much so, that
there's now a new nomenclature,

653
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,560
a new language emerging around cannabis

654
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,810
and the development of
novel strains of cannabis

655
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,810
for medicinal and/or
recreational purposes.

656
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,534
And while this might
sound a little bit medical

657
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:58,020
or a little bit clinical to
some people, believe it or not,

658
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,540
this is the nomenclature
that is now typically used.

659
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,292
People still refer to the sativa,
indica and hybrid strains,

660
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,540
but there's now also a description

661
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,280
of so-called type one, type
two and type three strains

662
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,850
for any given sativa,
indica or hybrid strain.

663
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,250
Okay, so just to put this
clearly in your mind,

664
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,490
you've got sativa varieties,
that is pure sativa varieties.

665
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,450
You have indica varieties,
again, pure indica,

666
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,820
and then you have hybrid varieties,

667
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,710
and beneath each of those,

668
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,699
you have type one, type
two and type three strains

669
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:37,699
of indica, sativa or hybrid varieties.

670
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,370
What are type one, type
two and type three?

671
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,009
Well, type one, type two
and type three strains

672
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:47,790
are strains that have varying amounts

673
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,363
or ratios of THC to CBD.

674
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,840
So for instance, type one strain,

675
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,170
so for instance, you could
have a pure sativa, type one,

676
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,829
or a type one pure sativa
or a type one indica.

677
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,260
Those are going to have
the greatest amount

678
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,570
of THC relative to CBD.

679
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,280
And I really want to emphasize this,

680
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,058
understanding the ratio of THC to CBD

681
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:14,430
can help explain a lot
or even predict a lot

682
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,810
about how a given strain of
cannabis will impact somebody.

683
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,558
For instance, because THC
is largely responsible

684
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,558
for the typical psychoactive
components of cannabis,

685
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:31,380
so what I mean here is, if
somebody's ingesting sativa,

686
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,650
and it routinely makes
them feel more energized,

687
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,480
elevates their mood,

688
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,310
it gives them a heightened
sense of creativity,

689
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,350
if that's what they experience,

690
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,720
and they're taking a
type one version of that,

691
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,241
that means that it's quite rich
in THC and very little CBD.

692
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:51,300
However, if they were to take
a type one version of sativa,

693
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,610
and it feels far too strong,
like too much energy,

694
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,530
or they felt like they were
too much in their head,

695
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,793
nowadays, there are strains of sativa

696
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:01,590
that have been genetically engineered,

697
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,750
and I don't mean by an
engineer tinkering away

698
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,640
with gene engineering in
a CRISPR creating mutes,

699
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,050
but literally by hybridizing,

700
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,860
crossing different plants to one another,

701
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,150
creating in a natural context,

702
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,983
the same way plants in the outside world

703
00:29:16,983 --> 00:29:19,653
would sometimes hybridize to one another,

704
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,610
creating a variety
that's perhaps type two,

705
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:28,503
which is going to have
less THC and more CBD,

706
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:31,560
or a type three, which is
going to be very high CBD

707
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,450
and very little THC,

708
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,069
and the same is also true
for the indica varieties.

709
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,220
So I want to make sure that
everyone understands this,

710
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,270
because it becomes very important

711
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,550
for understanding the biology of cannabis

712
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,425
and predicting positive versus
negative effects of cannabis.

713
00:29:46,425 --> 00:29:49,470
Sativa has this stimulant-like effect

714
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,630
and tends to be more of
a head high, if you will.

715
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,280
Indica tends to be more full-body,

716
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,073
then lead to more in-da-couch,
as I refer to it before,

717
00:29:56,923 --> 00:30:01,622
pun intended, deep relaxation,
reduce insomnia, et cetera.

718
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:03,750
Now, within each of
those sativa and indica,

719
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,220
you have type one, type
two and type three,

720
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,240
and that has everything
to do with how much THC,

721
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,180
which is the dominant
psychoactive compound,

722
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,990
versus CBD, which has other
effects, mainly on the body,

723
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,360
but not so much on the brain

724
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,100
and modes of thinking and mood, et cetera,

725
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,230
how much THC versus CBD is present.

726
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,140
And again, type one is THC dominant,

727
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,290
type two, equal ratios, if
you will, of THC and CBD,

728
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,858
and type three tend to be high CBD.

729
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:32,760
Okay, so already we've got
some categorization here

730
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,680
that hopefully isn't overwhelming to you,

731
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,140
but this turns out to
be extremely important

732
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,166
if you want to understand
how cannabis works

733
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,400
and predict the effects of cannabis.

734
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,780
I'd like to take a quick break

735
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,810
and acknowledge one of our
sponsors, Athletic Greens.

736
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,893
Athletic Greens, now called AG1,

737
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,670
is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink

738
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,550
that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.

739
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,250
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,

740
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,470
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

741
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,060
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens,

742
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,130
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens,

743
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,110
once are usually twice a day,

744
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,030
is that it gets to me the probiotics

745
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,710
that I need for gut health.

746
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,820
Our gut is very important.

747
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,370
It's populated by gut microbiota

748
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,140
that communicate with the
brain, the immune system,

749
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,540
and basically all the
biological systems of our body

750
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,751
to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health,

751
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,030
and those probiotics in Athletic Greens

752
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,870
are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.

753
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,700
In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number

754
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,350
of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals

755
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,937
that make sure that all of my foundational

756
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:33,690
and nutritional needs are
met, and it tastes great.

757
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,130
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

758
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,163
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

759
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,500
and they'll give you
five free travel packs

760
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,398
that make it really easy
to mix up Athletic Greens

761
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:43,680
while you're on the road,

762
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,390
in the car, on the plane, et cetera,

763
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,810
and they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

764
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,480
Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

765
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,860
to get the five free travel packs

766
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,800
and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.

767
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,330
Okay, so somewhat surprisingly,

768
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,710
we're going to set aside cannabis.

769
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,260
We're going to take what we
know about sativa, indica,

770
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,947
type one, type two, type
three, CBD, et cetera,

771
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:05,700
and we're just going to set
that aside for a moment.

772
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,533
Why would we do that?

773
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,640
Well, we have to ask ourselves,

774
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,530
why would any of these plants,

775
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,830
why would any of these
compounds, THC, CBD,

776
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,660
sativa, indica, et cetera,

777
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,332
why would any of that have
any effect on us at all?

778
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,750
And this discussion
that we're about to have

779
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,820
very much resembles the discussion

780
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,550
that we had on a previous
episode about nicotine,

781
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,050
because as many of you know,

782
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,480
nicotine is a commonly used substance.

783
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,440
In fact, if we were to look

784
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,110
at the three most commonly used drugs,

785
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,640
alcohol will be at the top of the list.

786
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,550
Many billions of people
regularly use alcohol

787
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,770
or occasionally use alcohol.

788
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,250
Many billions of people also use nicotine.

789
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,540
It's the second most consumed
drug, so more than 1 billion

790
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,120
and probably closer to 2
billion people consume nicotine,

791
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,528
and then the third most consumed drug

792
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:56,580
is cannabis in one form or another.

793
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,267
And many of you are probably shouting,

794
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,850
"What about caffeine?
What about caffeine?"

795
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,220
Well, in the context of drugs,

796
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,600
and in particular, addictive drugs,

797
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,180
caffeine doesn't quite rise to the list,

798
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,180
but if we were to look at caffeine

799
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,830
and include it in that list,

800
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,630
caffeine would be above all of those.

801
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,430
But the most commonly
used drugs are alcohol,

802
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:19,430
second after that is
nicotine and then cannabis.

803
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,900
Nicotine, as some of you may know,

804
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,370
if you listen to the episode on nicotine,

805
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,320
but even if you didn't,

806
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,720
nicotine comes from the tobacco plant,

807
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,640
and there are a few other
plants that include nicotine,

808
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,148
and typically it's brought
into the brain and body

809
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:34,290
by smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco,

810
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,443
snuffing tobacco or vaping nicotine.

811
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,010
Nicotine exists in the outside world

812
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,840
in these plants, the tobacco plants,

813
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,670
but the reason it has
an effect on the body

814
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,700
is that there are so-called
nicotinic receptors in the body.

815
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,370
Now, those nicotinic receptors
were named after nicotine,

816
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,934
the compound, but they
existed in the brain and body,

817
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:56,010
not because of the existence
of a tobacco plant,

818
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,130
but because there are
other chemicals in the body

819
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,010
that naturally occur, namely acetylcholine

820
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,113
that bind the nicotine receptor.

821
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,350
Those chemicals, such as acetylcholine,

822
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,748
that bind the nicotinic
receptor in your brain and body

823
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,882
create an enhanced sense of
focus, et cetera, et cetera.

824
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:17,882
But, nicotine from tobacco
binds that same receptor,

825
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,699
but with much greater affinity,

826
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,609
and therefore also
creates a state of focus,

827
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,844
but a much greater one than we
can achieve without nicotine.

828
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:28,530
So you can see the nicotine episode

829
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,280
if you want to learn more about that.

830
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,579
In a very similar way, all
of our brains and bodies,

831
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,820
from the time that we are
conceived, believe it or not,

832
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,417
very shortly after conception,
if we want to be accurate,

833
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:44,746
very early conception,
when you were in the womb,

834
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:47,070
and still now, if you're
listening to this,

835
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,840
you have what are called
cannabinoid receptors,

836
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,592
because you also have
endogenous cannabinoids.

837
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:56,669
What do we mean by that?

838
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,490
You have receptors, which
are like little parking spots

839
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,360
that are present on cells
in your brain and body,

840
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,730
and what we call a ligand,

841
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,620
which is basically just a
chemical that's released,

842
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,750
parks in that receptor

843
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,753
and causes a number of
different biological effects.

844
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,370
Cannabis contains compounds

845
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,530
that also bind to those receptors,

846
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,450
but here I want to make a
really clear distinction.

847
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,700
We have what are called
endogenous ligands,

848
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,280
those just mean chemicals from within us

849
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,420
that we make naturally,

850
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,400
even if we never go
near the cannabis plant

851
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,170
or any other source of cannabis,

852
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,230
we have chemicals that are created in us

853
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,340
that park in those receptors
and cause biological effects

854
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,350
on mood, on perception,
on the immune system,

855
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,670
on hunger, et cetera,

856
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,430
again, without ever going
anywhere near cannabis,

857
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,070
we have these endogenous cannabinoids.

858
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,710
So endogenous cannabinoids
are floating around in us,

859
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,270
or I should say, they are released in us

860
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,100
in particular ways,
bind to these receptors

861
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,800
and cause changes in
mood, appetite, et cetera.

862
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,127
They have many different
effects on the brain and body,

863
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,803
and we'll talk about those.

864
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,260
But just like with nicotine,

865
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,330
there are substances in the outside world,

866
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,840
in this case, cannabis
contains these substances,

867
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,840
so things like THC and like
CBD, that when ingested

868
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,226
by smoking or vaping
or by ingesting edibles

869
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:20,190
also will park in those same receptors,

870
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,390
the cannabinoid receptors and
lead to biological effects.

871
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,620
Now, it's a little bit misleading,

872
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,510
because we call them cannabinoid receptors

873
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,400
as if they were there to bind cannabis,

874
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,570
or just like we call
the nicotine receptors,

875
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,930
nicotinic receptors, it makes
it seem as if they were there

876
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,350
in order to bind nicotine from tobacco,

877
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,600
but that's not the way our
brains and bodies evolved.

878
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,630
Our brains and bodies
evolved for these receptors

879
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,600
to make use of chemicals
that exist within us,

880
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,510
called again, endogenous chemicals,

881
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,240
and those endogenous chemicals
lead to certain effects,

882
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,470
as I mentioned before.

883
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,640
The key thing here,

884
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,741
if you haven't understood
anything I've set up until now,

885
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:02,370
please understand this, the key thing is

886
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,780
that THC and CBD and the
other components of cannabis

887
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,460
bind to those receptors,

888
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,710
those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

889
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,970
the ones that we naturally
make, with much greater affinity

890
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,630
and exert a vastly
greater potency and effect

891
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,850
on mood and perception, et cetera,

892
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,973
than do our endogenous cannabinoids.

893
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,790
Another analogy that one could take

894
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,320
in order to understand this

895
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,830
would be hormones, like
testosterone and estrogen.

896
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,070
Many people, I would say all people,

897
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,620
make testosterone and
estrogen to varying degrees.

898
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,330
It's going to depend on whether
or not you're male, female,

899
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,860
your age, whether or not
you've gone through puberty,

900
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,270
et cetera, et cetera,

901
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,390
but let's just take
testosterone for example.

902
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,990
There's testosterone
circulating in your body.

903
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,820
That's true if you're male or female,

904
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,100
and there are receptors
called androgen receptors,

905
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,100
we could even call them
testosterone receptors.

906
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,230
And the testosterone
binds to those receptors

907
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,370
and has effects on cells.

908
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,710
It causes hair growth, changes the voice.

909
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,970
It can affect libido.

910
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,680
It affects all sorts of
things in the brain and body,

911
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,770
depending on which organ and
tissue you're talking about.

912
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,880
But of course,

913
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,100
there are people that take
synthetic testosterone

914
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,040
or derivatives of testosterone,

915
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,180
and some of those derivatives,

916
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,740
for instance, in the
body building community

917
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,640
and the sports community,

918
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,320
they will take things like Dianabol.

919
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,190
These are modified
versions of testosterone

920
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,160
that can bind to the testosterone receptor

921
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,140
with much greater affinity,

922
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,850
or I should say the androgen receptor

923
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,080
with much greater affinity,

924
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,110
and have supra physiological effects,

925
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,930
effects that would
essentially never be seen

926
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,483
from testosterone that was endogenously,

927
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:45,660
excuse me, endogenously
released within the body.

928
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,310
We could say the same thing for estrogen.

929
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,003
There are estrogen receptors,
they bind estrogen,

930
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,300
but if someone were to
take synthetic estrogen

931
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,890
or to ingest a plant compound

932
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,867
that contains various
estrogenic compounds,

933
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,720
and those plants
certainly exist out there,

934
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,270
they can have supra physiological effects

935
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,830
on those receptors.

936
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,120
Why am I telling you this?

937
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,080
Well, many people believe
that because cannabis,

938
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,130
marijuana is a plant, and
plants grow out of the ground,

939
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,140
and they're naturally occurring,

940
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,380
and because we have receptors in our body

941
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,070
that are there without
the need to engineer them

942
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,070
from some external source,
they're in our genome.

943
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,720
They're program for it, and
we're born with these things,

944
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,120
and we keep these our entire life.

945
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,560
Many people mistakenly think,
ah, these plant compounds

946
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,600
are safer for us or better for us,

947
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,528
or are somehow appropriate
for us to ingest,

948
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:42,600
but that's simply not true,
and here, I'm not saying

949
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,760
that cannabis is always
a bad idea for people.

950
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,500
There are certain populations
and certain people

951
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,530
for which it can be relatively
safe recreationally,

952
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,510
that's the truth, and
there are other populations

953
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,490
for which it can be downright dangerous,

954
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,920
recreationally or medicinally.

955
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,420
And of course, there
are medicinal purposes

956
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,640
that are being explored, and
we'll talk more about that.

957
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,170
But this is vital to understand,

958
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,527
because I think that when we hear,

959
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,710
"Oh, it's from a plant, it's natural,"

960
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,240
and then you also have
a receptor for these,

961
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,070
endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

962
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,520
and therefore, the marriage of those two,

963
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,390
the coming together of the
chemical THC or CBD or both

964
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,300
with these receptors is
somehow supposed to happen

965
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,480
as if this was a purpose
of having these receptors,

966
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,610
but it's simply not the case.

967
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,840
In the same way that
the nicotinic receptors

968
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,390
are not there because
nicotine is good for us,

969
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,680
they're there because there are compounds

970
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,960
that exist within us that are good

971
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,200
to bind to those receptors
from time to time.

972
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,270
Now, here's the key thing about,

973
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,800
I guess today, I'm saying
there are a lot of key things,

974
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,070
but here's another key thing
about understanding cannabis

975
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:45,780
and the way that it works,
which is that THC and CBD,

976
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,640
when they're brought
into the brain and body

977
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,493
by smoking or edible, et cetera,

978
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,970
they bind to those receptors,

979
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,370
those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

980
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,500
and they tap into the same systems

981
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,860
that your endogenous
cannabinoids would tap into,

982
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,420
the ones that affect mood and energy

983
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,910
and creativity and relaxation, et cetera,

984
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,910
but they do so with thousand
fold greater potency.

985
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,290
And as a consequence of that,

986
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,860
your endogenous cannabinoids
are outcompeted.

987
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,630
They really get no opportunity

988
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,760
to interact with those receptors.

989
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,710
And understanding that,

990
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,620
can lead to a very clear
understanding of why, for instance,

991
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,800
when people use cannabis
to relieve anxiety,

992
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,170
or they use cannabis to
enter a certain brain state

993
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,660
for creativity or to enter sleep,

994
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,110
why a dependence on
cannabis starts to emerge.

995
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,570
Because if they don't ingest cannabis,

996
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,770
and again, ingest could
mean smoke to bring THC in,

997
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,200
or CBD in, or ingest
orally or even transdermal

998
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,103
or tincture or one of the other varieties,

999
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:51,708
if they don't do that,
then what happens is

1000
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:55,530
not only are the receptors not
stimulated to the same degree

1001
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,100
or with the same potency
that they normally are,

1002
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,200
but the endogenous cannabinoids

1003
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,670
can no longer have their effect,

1004
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,190
so people experience
heightened levels of anxiety,

1005
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,900
disrupted mood, disrupted
brain state, and so on.

1006
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,940
Now, again, I want to be very clear

1007
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,010
that I'm not trying to
paint a picture of cannabis

1008
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,170
as all bad or even partially bad.

1009
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,490
What I want to do today is give you

1010
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,480
as much information I can
as to how cannabis works,

1011
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,070
how its different component parts work,

1012
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,720
how the different types of cannabis work,

1013
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,201
and point to some of
the valid medicinal uses

1014
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:30,240
and some of the recreational uses,

1015
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,960
and then lay out the landscape for you

1016
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,761
as to who is really most at risk

1017
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,430
in terms of psychoactive components,

1018
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,680
immune components and so on and so forth,

1019
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,570
so that you can make the
most informed choice for you.

1020
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,607
I am not here to tell you
what to do or what not to do.

1021
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:48,829
As I like to say, do as you wish,

1022
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:51,270
I mean, don't do as you wish

1023
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,500
if it harms other people or yourself,

1024
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,050
but do as you wish, but
know what you're doing,

1025
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,550
so that's really my goal here.

1026
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,620
So as we begin to dive
further into the biology,

1027
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,890
I think you'll start to
get a clearer picture

1028
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:03,780
of why cannabis is so
effective in some context,

1029
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,770
but also why it can create
such massive suffering

1030
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,290
in other contexts because of the way

1031
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,270
that it out-competes your own natural

1032
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,066
endogenous cannabinoid systems.

1033
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:16,800
So let's talk about those
endogenous cannabinoid systems,

1034
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,690
what they are and how they work,

1035
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,430
because that will give us a lens

1036
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,690
into what the higher
potency or maximum impact

1037
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,567
of the various cannabis
plant varieties and strains

1038
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:31,020
in THC and CBD and so forth,
how and why those work.

1039
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,030
So what are the endogenous cannabinoids,

1040
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,870
these chemical substances
that everybody makes?

1041
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,430
You make them, I make them.

1042
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,050
You've been making them basically

1043
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,220
from the time that you were conceived,

1044
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,920
and you are going to make them
until the time that you die.

1045
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,540
Whether or not they have the impact

1046
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,670
and the biological functions
that I'm about to describe

1047
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,590
will depend a lot on whether or not

1048
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,642
you are using your own
endogenous cannabinoids

1049
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:55,860
to park in those receptors
that you also have

1050
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,648
from birth until death,

1051
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:01,800
or whether or not you are
tickling those receptors

1052
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,410
or strongly activating those receptors

1053
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,410
using some external source like
cannabis and THC, et cetera.

1054
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,070
The two main endogenous cannabinoids

1055
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,710
that we want to consider are anandamide,

1056
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:20,370
which we will refer to
as EAE, so anandamide,

1057
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,720
and another one, which
is arachidonoyl-glycerol,

1058
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,170
arachidonoyl-glycerol, which
we will abbreviate 2-AG.

1059
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,760
So let's just take EAE and
2-AG, lump them together

1060
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,800
and talk about the
endogenous cannabinoids,

1061
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,910
just to make it simple.

1062
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,280
But if you want to do the
deep dive on anadamide

1063
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,643
versus 2-AG, please be my guest.

1064
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,020
The endogenous cannabinoids
are released from neurons.

1065
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,630
What are neurons? Neurons are nerve cells.

1066
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,960
And nerve cells should be
conceptualized like this.

1067
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,990
You have presynaptic neurons
and postsynaptic neurons.

1068
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,780
Presynaptic neurons basically
contain little vesicles,

1069
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,840
little bubbles full of neurotransmitter,

1070
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,070
which are chemicals,

1071
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,160
and when neurons are
stimulated electrically,

1072
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,600
and that could be from a thought,

1073
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,880
it could be from the desire to move,

1074
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,740
it could be because of a drug,

1075
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,044
it could be because you're hungry,

1076
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:18,044
the relevant neurons will vomit
out or will fuse, as we say,

1077
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,640
those little packets, those little bubbles

1078
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,770
of neurotransmitter into the gap

1079
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:23,667
between the pre and postsynaptic neuron,

1080
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,580
and we call that a synaptic
cleft or the synapse.

1081
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,930
It's a little gap, a little space,

1082
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,810
and the neurotransmitter
flows across that synapse,

1083
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,510
and some of it will park
in the little parking spots

1084
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,510
that we call receptors on
the postsynaptic neuron side.

1085
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,430
Depending on which neurotransmitter it is,

1086
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,380
and a bunch of other things
not worth going into right now,

1087
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,440
the parking of that chemical

1088
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,850
and those neurotransmitter receptors

1089
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,930
will either cause that neuron
on the postsynaptic side

1090
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,390
to itself, release
neurotransmitter elsewhere,

1091
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,690
or it will quiet it down,

1092
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,430
so-called excitation and inhibition.

1093
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,590
That's kind of neuro
transmission in a nutshell.

1094
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,240
If you don't understand it, no big deal.

1095
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,170
It's not going to prevent you

1096
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,430
from understanding today's discussion.

1097
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,410
If you understand even a small fraction

1098
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,790
of what I've just said,

1099
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,700
then it's going to allow you to understand

1100
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,508
not just today's discussion,
but a lot of neuroscience

1101
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:13,593
with a lot more nuance and
depth of understanding.

1102
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,960
The key thing to know about
the endogenous cannabinoids

1103
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,560
is that unlike most neurotransmitters,

1104
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,740
they are released from
the postsynaptic side.

1105
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,230
So what happens is neurotransmitter goes

1106
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,170
from presynaptic neuron
to postsynaptic neuron,

1107
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,030
but under certain conditions,

1108
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,510
the postsynaptic neuron,
itself, releases a chemical,

1109
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,037
and that chemical goes backward,
what we call retrogradely,

1110
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:43,020
to the presynaptic neuron,
binds to receptors there

1111
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,182
and changes the probability
that the presynaptic neuron

1112
00:46:46,182 --> 00:46:48,123
will release neurotransmitter.

1113
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:52,500
Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids

1114
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,200
tend to decrease the probability

1115
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,040
that a neuron will
release neurotransmitter.

1116
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,810
They're a break on the system.

1117
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,050
They're a way of shutting
down the communication

1118
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,150
between neurons, regulating it,

1119
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,530
not to make it completely quiet,

1120
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,710
but to adjust the levels
with a lot of nuance.

1121
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,620
Now, the other thing that the
endogenous cannabinoids do

1122
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,340
is a mind bender, because
we're talking about cannabis,

1123
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,650
and a commonly known feature

1124
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,020
of cannabis and marijuana consumption

1125
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,060
is disruptions in short-term memory,

1126
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,250
and there is essentially zero debate

1127
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,570
as to whether or not that occurs,

1128
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,820
and we'll talk about the
mechanisms a little bit later.

1129
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,359
And yet, endogenous cannabinoids,

1130
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,340
the chemicals that you naturally release

1131
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,750
from these postsynaptic neurons

1132
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,759
that travel retrogradely back
to the presynaptic neuron,

1133
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:43,860
actually can lead to
strengthening of connections

1134
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,310
between the presynaptic neuron
and the postsynaptic neuron

1135
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:51,630
through a process called
long-term potentiation, or LTP.

1136
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:52,920
They can also cause

1137
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,250
what's called depression of communication

1138
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,000
between a presynaptic neuron
and a postsynaptic neuron.

1139
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,630
Long-term depression has nothing to do

1140
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,431
with depression as a psychological
state or as a illness.

1141
00:48:08,431 --> 00:48:11,100
Long-term potentiation
and long-term depression

1142
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,960
simply refer to the probability

1143
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,640
that one neuron will be able

1144
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,280
to stimulate and activate another neuron.

1145
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,237
And, as I just told you,

1146
00:48:19,237 --> 00:48:23,250
the endogenous cannabinoids
can either turn up the dial

1147
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,450
or turn down the dial.

1148
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,370
They can either increase the probability

1149
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,110
or decrease the probability

1150
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,600
that a given connection between neurons

1151
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,360
will function more or will function less.

1152
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,100
So if you think about the
communication between neurons

1153
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,890
as crosstalk, as a conversation,

1154
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,000
well, the endogenous cannabinoids
can dictate whether or not

1155
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,700
that conversation is likely
to occur or not to occur.

1156
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,400
Think of them as either putting someone

1157
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,979
at the top of your text
chain in your phone,

1158
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:52,500
which would be long-term potentiation,

1159
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,140
or essentially blocking their number,

1160
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,723
which would essentially
be long-term depression.

1161
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,900
So, if you're getting the impression

1162
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,280
that the endogenous cannabinoids

1163
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,200
are working in a number of different ways,

1164
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,270
and it's not very
straightforward, you're right.

1165
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,490
In fact, that's the message
that I'd like you to take away.

1166
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,290
The endogenous cannabinoids

1167
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,450
are sometimes increasing
neuronal communication.

1168
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,460
This can lead to increases in mood

1169
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,380
or increases in the likelihood

1170
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,420
that someone will talk a certain way

1171
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,523
or behave a certain way
or feel a certain way.

1172
00:49:20,523 --> 00:49:24,240
That can also lead to decreases
in synaptic transmission,

1173
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,800
that is communication between neurons,

1174
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,190
in ways that will make
somebody's mood lower,

1175
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,400
or will make them less
hungry or more hungry.

1176
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,010
And, here's the really key thing,

1177
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,280
there are two kinds of
endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

1178
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,980
referred to as CB1 and CB2,

1179
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,670
and we can say with confidence that CB1

1180
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,680
is highly enriched in the nervous system,

1181
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,180
and especially within the brain.

1182
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,530
It's found not everywhere,

1183
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,120
but almost everywhere in the brain

1184
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,200
and elsewhere in the nervous system,

1185
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,980
so spinal cord and other
aspects of the nervous system.

1186
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,270
CB2, the cannabinoid receptor, CB2

1187
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,550
is largely located in
the tissues of the body,

1188
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,165
including the immune system, the liver,

1189
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:07,080
even the genitals, et cetera.

1190
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,413
So what this means is that
the endogenous cannabinoids

1191
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,400
are having these sorts of effects

1192
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,660
on neurons that I talked about,

1193
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,690
but they are also having
effects on immune cells,

1194
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,640
on reproductive organs, on liver,

1195
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,710
on digestion, on hunger, et cetera,

1196
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,050
through mechanisms that are divorced

1197
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,930
from the function of the
nervous system of neurons.

1198
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,910
Now, in reality, no system
of the brain and body

1199
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,110
is divorced from the nervous system,

1200
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,360
because the nervous system
is controlling everything.

1201
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,680
It is really the master controller,

1202
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,480
and everything's feeding
back to the nervous system,

1203
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,920
so it's a two way street.

1204
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,819
But the simple way to think
about it is CB1 receptors

1205
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:39,927
are mainly in the nervous system,

1206
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:42,360
and CB2 receptors are mainly in the body

1207
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:47,360
and endogenous cannabinoids,
again, EAE, anandamide,

1208
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,580
and 2-AG, arachidonoyl-glycerol,

1209
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,490
are impacting CB1 and CB2 receptors.

1210
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,307
Today we're mainly going to
talk about CB1 receptors,

1211
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:57,270
'cause they are the ones
that are responsible

1212
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,820
for most of the familiar
effects of cannabis,

1213
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:04,290
but the key takeaway at this
point is to really understand

1214
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,740
that the major effects of
your endogenous cannabinoids

1215
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:12,240
on these receptors in this
particular CB1 are very nuanced.

1216
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,280
It depends on context,
depends on which neurons.

1217
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,040
It's sometimes increasing
communication between neurons,

1218
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,270
sometimes decreasing it, and
then along comes cannabis,

1219
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,070
and that cannabis, again,

1220
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,376
can arrive by smoking,
by vaping, by edible.

1221
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:29,758
And cannabis contains THC and CBD

1222
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:34,740
that potently bind the CB1 receptor,

1223
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,620
and now the effects of the CB1 receptor

1224
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:42,620
being occupied by THC or
being occupied by CBD,

1225
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,880
are not very nuanced.

1226
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,550
In fact, they are very predictable

1227
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,160
and especially important is to understand

1228
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,280
that they are so strong, and
they park in that receptor

1229
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,580
with such affinity, with
such force and precision

1230
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,140
and stubbornness and refusal
to leave that receptor

1231
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,040
that they completely outcompete

1232
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,140
the endogenous cannabinoid system.

1233
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,480
In fact, they leave the
endogenous cannabinoid system

1234
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,050
essentially dysfunctional,
which, in some cases,

1235
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,600
may be a good thing, but in most cases,

1236
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,120
is going to lead to
problems of various kinds,

1237
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,560
and we'll talk about
what sorts of problems.

1238
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,511
And again, I feel obligated to say,

1239
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:23,250
this is not me saying don't
ingest cannabis or THC or CBD.

1240
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,420
That's not what I'm saying.

1241
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,528
What I'm saying is if
you evaluate the potency

1242
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,490
that is in technical terms,

1243
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,580
it would be the affinity
with which these compounds,

1244
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,260
THC and CBD and CBN, bind to
these endogenous receptors,

1245
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,740
that would be like a howitzer
gun, like a cannon going off,

1246
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,040
as compared to endogenous cannabinoid,

1247
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,620
whether or not it's EAE or 2-AG,

1248
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,740
which is more like a cap
gun level of activation,

1249
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,000
at least in this analogy.

1250
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,096
So now you have what at
least I would like to think

1251
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:55,680
is a fairly complete understanding

1252
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,810
of the different varieties of cannabis,

1253
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,962
at least at a broad sweep,

1254
00:52:59,962 --> 00:53:03,120
and the different biological
effects that they can have,

1255
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,920
at least in terms of the major receptors

1256
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,980
and in retrograde signaling,
et cetera, et cetera.

1257
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,530
Now, let's take a step
back into the real world

1258
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,540
and evaluate or think about

1259
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,889
what happens when somebody smokes cannabis

1260
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:18,720
or ingests cannabis by way of edible

1261
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,620
or tincture or something of that sort.

1262
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,443
Cannabis is very fast to
enter the bloodstream.

1263
00:53:26,472 --> 00:53:30,090
In fact, within 30 seconds,
it's going to enter the brain

1264
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,370
and permeate throughout
the brain and body.

1265
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,750
That's very, very fast.

1266
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,800
I mean, when you contrast that

1267
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,320
with something like
alcohol or even nicotine,

1268
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,180
depending on how the
nicotine is delivered,

1269
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,600
that is a very fast
delivery of the psychoactive

1270
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,400
and biologically active compound,

1271
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,347
which in this case is THC and CBD

1272
00:53:46,347 --> 00:53:48,810
and probably some other things as well.

1273
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,950
So within 30 seconds,

1274
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,950
it reaches the brain and bodily tissues,

1275
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:56,190
and within 30 to 60 minutes,

1276
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,342
it's going to reach
its peak concentrations

1277
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:00,960
and have its peak biological effects.

1278
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,980
Those aren't always the same thing,

1279
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,420
but in the case of cannabis,

1280
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,259
again here I'm using
cannabis as an umbrella term

1281
00:54:06,259 --> 00:54:08,850
for THC and CBD, the
effects are going to peak

1282
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,600
at about 30 to 60 minutes
after bringing those compounds

1283
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,060
into the body in some way or another.

1284
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,410
And the effects tend to last

1285
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,030
anywhere from three to four hours,

1286
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,770
although there's some variation on that,

1287
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,900
depending on individual metabolism,

1288
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,400
whether or not somebody is
familiar with the compound,

1289
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,840
believe it or not,
psychologically familiar,

1290
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,520
but also biologically familiar,

1291
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,840
or whether or not it's a first time use

1292
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,240
or occasional use and so on.

1293
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:37,710
THC and CBD and other
components of cannabis

1294
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,600
are highly what we call lipophilic.

1295
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,390
That is, they have an affinity toward,

1296
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,203
and they can actually pass
through fatty tissues.

1297
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:47,100
Now, every cell in your
body, but especially neurons,

1298
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,917
have a double layer of
fat on their outside.

1299
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,840
And of course, when people hear "fat,"

1300
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,150
they always think, ooh, fat's bad.

1301
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,060
Most of the world seems to
want to lose fat or bodily fat.

1302
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,850
Here we're talking about
the fatty membrane,

1303
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,650
the barrier around each tissue,

1304
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,410
in this case we're talking
particularly about neurons.

1305
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:08,790
And THC and CBD and the
other components of cannabis

1306
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,040
are highly lipophilic,
so they can get into

1307
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,740
essentially all cells just
simply by flowing into them.

1308
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,040
They will also remain in
those cells for a long time.

1309
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,350
So, I know that a number of people,

1310
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,420
depending on whether
or not they get tested

1311
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,520
for work or for sport or otherwise

1312
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,343
for cannabis or CBD and THC,

1313
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,010
don't take this as a strict number,

1314
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:34,010
but typically, if one ingests CBD or THC,

1315
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,960
smokes cannabis, ingests
by orally, et cetera,

1316
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,600
doesn't matter, it's going
to stay in that fatty tissue

1317
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,990
and can be detected for at
least as long as 80 days

1318
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,850
after ingestion, and
there's a whole industry

1319
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,910
as to how to accelerate the clearance,

1320
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,300
and I should just tell you
that just losing bodily fat

1321
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,008
isn't going to eliminate
it from your system,

1322
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:56,460
maybe partially in those fat cells,

1323
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,450
but certainly intravisceral
fat and other fatty tissue

1324
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,400
that's in around the brain and body

1325
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,720
is going to harbor that THC
molecule and the CBD molecule

1326
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,300
for quite a long while, at least 80 days.

1327
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,500
So, if someone smokes cannabis
or they ingest cannabis,

1328
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,440
it very rapidly gets into the bloodstream,

1329
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,210
and the components that are psychoactive

1330
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,260
get into the bloodstream

1331
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,610
and are immediately able to
access neurons and other cells

1332
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:24,630
and start having these effects

1333
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,240
of parking at those endogenous
cannabinoid receptors

1334
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,520
and impacting the
signaling between neurons,

1335
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,020
which leads to the subjective
effects of cannabis,

1336
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,970
including THC and CBDs,
so let's talk about

1337
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,550
what those different
subjective effects are.

1338
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,530
Again, this is going to vary
depending on whether or not

1339
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,307
people are ingesting sativa
varieties of cannabis,

1340
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:47,550
just to remind you, those
tend to be elevated mood,

1341
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,020
alertness, talkativeness.

1342
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,750
People who take sativa varieties
tend to talk a lot more

1343
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,430
than they would otherwise.

1344
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,840
Again, there are exceptions to this,

1345
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,070
of course there are exceptions.

1346
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,420
I'm sure there are people
out there shouting,

1347
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,650
although I guess if
you're the quiet people

1348
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,320
who don't talk too much,
you're probably not shouting,

1349
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,940
or if you're not, you're
not doing on sativa,

1350
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,970
Joe contended, but in any
event, there are exceptions,

1351
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:07,770
but there are also general rules.

1352
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,110
And the sativas tend to
make people's mood elevated,

1353
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:13,080
energetic, again, this sort of head high,

1354
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,530
and indica varieties
tend to do the opposite.

1355
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,920
more of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.

1356
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,930
Why and how would they do that?

1357
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,330
Well, without going into
an extensive deep dive

1358
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:25,700
into the different
neurotransmitter systems

1359
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,650
of the brain and body,
what we know for sure

1360
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,290
is that CB1 receptors are present

1361
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,090
on an enormous number of different neurons

1362
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,370
in brain structures in neural circuits,

1363
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:39,780
so that the sativa varieties
that act as a stimulant,

1364
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,870
making people feel happy,

1365
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,450
'cause in general, they
do tend to elevate mood,

1366
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,140
at least at certain dosages, talkative,

1367
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,960
tend to make people feel
like they have ideas

1368
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,540
that are interesting, that
they might want to share,

1369
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,270
tend to narrow their context,
so we tend to increase focus.

1370
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,460
This is something that's not
often discussed about cannabis,

1371
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,320
but especially the sativa varieties

1372
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,410
can increase people's level
of focus to particular things,

1373
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,300
something they're watching
or something they're doing

1374
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,100
or music, it allows them to
narrow their sense of focus.

1375
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,440
That's going to occur by
activation of CB1 receptors

1376
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,940
in the so-called prefrontal cortex,

1377
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,590
which is just behind the forehead,

1378
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:19,890
and the prefrontal cortex
acts as a strong modulator

1379
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:22,620
of so-called limbic
circuitry and other circuitry

1380
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,600
that is more stress oriented.

1381
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,990
The way to think about the
stress and limbic circuitry,

1382
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,963
such as the amygdala, which
many people have heard about,

1383
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,728
is that they aren't really
circuits for fear and stress.

1384
00:58:32,728 --> 00:58:35,400
They are circuits that
are constantly evaluating

1385
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,280
one's own internal state,
heart rate, et cetera,

1386
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,790
and what's happening
externally, and, sorry to say,

1387
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,850
but the default of those
systems is to detect danger,

1388
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,380
so threat detection systems.

1389
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,540
And then the prefrontal
cortex largely acts

1390
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,340
as a brake on those systems,

1391
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,190
so like the reins pulling
back on a steed of horses

1392
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,500
that would otherwise just take off.

1393
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,310
And so, the sativa varieties
tend to increase CB1 activation

1394
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,130
in the prefrontal cortex
and in other circuitry

1395
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,250
that then leads to an
overall reduction in stress,

1396
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,720
because of the way that
prefrontal circuitry

1397
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,270
can reduce activation or the amygdala.

1398
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:11,580
Now that, of course, does not explain

1399
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,550
why some people become very
stressed and very paranoid

1400
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,200
when they smoke sativa varieties

1401
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,970
or other varieties of cannabis

1402
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,650
or ingest other varieties of cannabis.

1403
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,560
We'll talk about the paranoid
effect and why that occurs

1404
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,230
and who might predict
that would occur to them

1405
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,760
in a little bit.

1406
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,950
But I just want to give you a
sense of how this is working,

1407
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,513
because as I mentioned before,

1408
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,920
THC and/or CBD are going
to bind that CB1 receptor,

1409
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,847
let's say in prefrontal cortex,

1410
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:38,400
the neurons of the prefrontal
cortex, it's going to bind there,

1411
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,350
and then they'll be a retrograde signaling

1412
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,337
back to the presynaptic neuron,

1413
00:59:41,337 --> 00:59:43,470
and in the case of prefrontal cortex,

1414
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:46,470
what's happening is it's
increasing transmission,

1415
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,150
increasing the release of neurotransmitter

1416
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,740
in the prefrontal cortex.

1417
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,483
However, at the same time,

1418
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:56,520
the very same THC and CBD that
was brought into the system

1419
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,120
is binding the very same type
of receptors, CB1 receptors,

1420
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,300
in other brain structures,
such as the amygdala

1421
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,820
and causing retrograde signaling

1422
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,180
back to the presynaptic
neurons in the amygdala,

1423
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,886
but it's quieting the
activation of those neurons,

1424
01:00:12,886 --> 01:00:14,490
so this is interesting.

1425
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:18,240
We have the same
compounds, THC and/or CBD,

1426
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,910
brought into the body and brain,

1427
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:25,230
binding the same receptors, in
this case the CB1 receptors,

1428
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,470
but depending on where
those receptors are located

1429
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:31,110
and which brain areas we're referring to,

1430
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:36,110
they are either causing
heightened levels of alertness

1431
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,580
and activation of
systems that are designed

1432
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,070
to make you talkative and
alertness and mood, et cetera,

1433
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:45,720
focus, or they're causing
suppression of those circuitries.

1434
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,730
So we have kind of a seesaw effect here

1435
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,920
where the same compound is
increasing mood and alertness

1436
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,270
and focus in the prefrontal cortex

1437
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:54,540
and is decreasing stress
and threat detection

1438
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,420
in the amygdala, and that's
one of the reasons why,

1439
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,360
especially the sativa
varieties of cannabis,

1440
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,820
allow people to enter
these states of focus,

1441
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,610
some might even say flow,
although I don't want to go

1442
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,380
into what flow states really are.

1443
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,210
That's for a different discussion,

1444
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,630
and it's very poorly defined as it is.

1445
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,400
And I certainly don't want
to give people the impression

1446
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,080
that cannabis increases flow states,

1447
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,660
because that's not always the case,

1448
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,060
and certainly most often is
not going to be the case.

1449
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,540
But the idea here is that this
molecule comes into our brain

1450
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,720
and is shifting everything
towards a state of focus,

1451
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,960
elevated mood of heightened
sense of importance

1452
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,820
about whatever it is that
we happen to be doing.

1453
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,430
And now of course, whatever
we could happen to be doing

1454
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,240
could be writing a song, writing poetry,

1455
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,560
communicating with somebody,

1456
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,300
but it could also be something as trivial

1457
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,870
as watching cartoons or watching a movie,

1458
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,120
which is not trivial in its own right,

1459
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,910
but in terms of thinking
about the creative aspects

1460
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:54,240
or the creativity stimulating
aspects of cannabis,

1461
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,030
not productivity oriented.

1462
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,070
So narrowed focus, elevated mood,

1463
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,230
more relaxed and yet energetic,

1464
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,170
that's the major effects
of the sativa varieties,

1465
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:07,050
except, and this is a really big boldface,

1466
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,910
triple underlined 'except,'

1467
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,360
except in some individuals,
depending on dosage,

1468
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,410
but also depending on
preexisting neural circuitry

1469
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,270
and propensity for anxiety,

1470
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:22,170
some people ingest or
smoke sativa varieties,

1471
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,940
and regardless of whether
or not it's a type one,

1472
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,980
type two or type three variety,

1473
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,160
regardless of the ratio
between THC and CBD,

1474
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,930
people will experience
intense anxiety and paranoia.

1475
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,640
Now, how do you predict

1476
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,220
who will experience intense
anxiety and paranoia

1477
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:41,700
and who will experience
intense relaxation, focus

1478
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,730
and sense of creativity from ingesting

1479
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:47,940
or smoking a type one, type
two or type three sativa?

1480
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,550
Well, there is no way to predict that,

1481
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,010
and there's a lot of what
I would call street lore

1482
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:57,900
or dorm room lore or not peer reviewed,

1483
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,130
but peer discussed
among friends and people

1484
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,850
and acquaintances lore out
there that what one needs to do

1485
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,640
is simply smoke more, or just ingest more.

1486
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,987
You hear that, "Oh, well listen,
if it makes you paranoid,

1487
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,360
"you simply need to use more,"

1488
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,850
that is absolutely categorically false.

1489
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:18,210
Everything we know about the
way that THC and CBD work

1490
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:20,070
is that they tend to potentiate,

1491
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:25,070
that is increase the effects
of these different systems

1492
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,300
at given synapses and in different areas

1493
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,133
of the brain and body.

1494
01:03:28,133 --> 01:03:32,910
That is, if someone
experiences paranoia or anxiety

1495
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:37,140
from a given strain of the marijuana plant

1496
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,033
or from ingesting an
edible in a particular way

1497
01:03:39,033 --> 01:03:40,773
or a particular kind of edible,

1498
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,850
that person is very likely
to experience the same effect

1499
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,433
every time they ingest
that strain or variety.

1500
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,080
This is part of what's led
to this enormous industry.

1501
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,100
I mean, there are a number
of different reasons,

1502
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,260
but this is part of what's
led to this enormous industry

1503
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,560
of highly customized cannabis

1504
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,270
where people will spend some time

1505
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,730
really seeking out the
different strains of cannabis

1506
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:06,329
and hybrids of cannabis
that work best for them

1507
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:09,690
and work best for them
in particular context.

1508
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:12,840
I wish I could tell you
that if you are a person

1509
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,320
who is between 5' 7" and 6' tall,

1510
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,440
and you have blue eyes or brown eyes,

1511
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,810
that the sativa varieties are
going to be right for you,

1512
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,450
or that sativa varieties are
going to give you panic attacks,

1513
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,470
I can't do that.

1514
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,180
The only way to determine it would be

1515
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,180
to actually experience ingesting
those or smoking those,

1516
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,460
which is certainly also
not what I'm suggesting.

1517
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,293
That's up to you.

1518
01:04:33,293 --> 01:04:35,220
I'm not telling you what
to do or what not to do,

1519
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,990
but there are no good predictors.

1520
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:39,960
In fact, if you look in the literature,

1521
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,550
it is not at all clear that people

1522
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:44,151
who have a heightened level of anxiety

1523
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:47,040
when they do not smoke cannabis

1524
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,890
will experience cannabis

1525
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:53,250
as less paranoia inducing
or more relaxing.

1526
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,230
That's simply not the case.

1527
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,930
Now, what we can say for sure

1528
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,810
is that general categories of effects,

1529
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,630
such as increased focus
and reduced anxiety

1530
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:05,460
are largely due to activation of areas

1531
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,990
like the prefrontal cortex.

1532
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,200
Now, unlike other compounds
like nicotine or alcohol

1533
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,180
or neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,

1534
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,520
when we talk about the cannabinoid system,

1535
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,990
and I say effects, biological
effects, psychoactive effects,

1536
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,910
I want you to keep in mind always,

1537
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:22,890
please, please, please keep in mind

1538
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,530
that those effects can be varied

1539
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:28,710
and often opposite in direction,

1540
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:30,900
so let's just give an example of that.

1541
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:34,800
I just mentioned that when
people smoke or or eat sativa,

1542
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,145
that it tends to lead to one specific set,

1543
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:40,590
or generally leads to one
specific set of effects,

1544
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:41,970
heightened focus, mood, et cetera.

1545
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:46,970
Whereas when they ingest or
smoke indica and its components,

1546
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,890
again, we're still
talking about THC and CBD

1547
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:54,457
in varying ratios, but now
indica cannabis, and you say,

1548
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:58,200
"Well, why would it improve
the transition time to sleep?"

1549
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,520
Or at least give people the impression

1550
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,050
that it improves the
transition time to sleep.

1551
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,610
We'll talk about what indica actually does

1552
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:04,470
for sleep in a little bit,

1553
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:07,220
but indica also tends
to suppress activation

1554
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,630
of the amygdala and threat
detection centers in the brain,

1555
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:11,610
again, binding the same CB1 receptors

1556
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,719
in those retrograde signaling mechanisms

1557
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,150
that I talked about before,

1558
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,360
but it also tends to shut
down the hippocampus,

1559
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,750
an area of the brain
associated with memory,

1560
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:26,100
which is why indica
varieties lead to pronounced,

1561
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,430
or I should say profound
defects in short-term memory

1562
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,050
and sometimes in long-term memory as well,

1563
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,930
if it's consumed over
long periods of time.

1564
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,300
We'll talk about short, medium
and long-term consumption,

1565
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,040
occasional consumption going forward.

1566
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,090
So what I'd like you to take away

1567
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:41,793
from this component of the
discussion is first of all,

1568
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,950
the mechanism of action

1569
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:47,896
by which cannabis impacts
the brain and body,

1570
01:06:47,896 --> 01:06:49,320
but in particular the brain,

1571
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,607
is going to be through CB1 receptors,

1572
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:54,240
and those CB1 receptors can
lead to either an acceleration

1573
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,730
or a brake on particular
biological mechanisms.

1574
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:59,640
And there are going to be a constellation

1575
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,010
of different accelerations and braking

1576
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,190
of different neural systems
in the brain and body,

1577
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,950
depending on whether or
not people ingest sativa

1578
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,084
or indica or some hybrid strain.

1579
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:11,910
And perhaps most importantly,

1580
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:12,743
even if you didn't understand anything

1581
01:07:12,743 --> 01:07:14,490
that I've said about the biology

1582
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,440
of these different
strains in the receptors,

1583
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,400
please do understand that
there is no way to predict

1584
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,390
what the effect of a given
strain will be on an individual.

1585
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,760
There has been extensive exploration

1586
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,370
as to whether or not people
who are so called mellower

1587
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,310
or more anxious or any number

1588
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:34,680
of different personality dimensions

1589
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,150
will respond in one way or the other,

1590
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:38,610
but, in fact, there is no way to tell.

1591
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:43,260
Layer on top of that the
fact that dosing THC and CBD

1592
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,350
can be fairly straightforward
in the form of edibles,

1593
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:49,934
because there can be, at least
if it's a controlled source,

1594
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:53,580
a defined number of milligrams of THC,

1595
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,010
a defined number of milligrams of CBD.

1596
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,960
That's true for ingestibles.

1597
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,180
It's much harder to gauge that

1598
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,580
from the smokeable forms of cannabis,

1599
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,226
especially if those
smokeable forms of cannabis

1600
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:05,730
are obtained through sources

1601
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:08,190
where there isn't a lot
of clear information

1602
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:11,280
about the total amount
of THC in that product.

1603
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,320
Now, this is all changing
quite a lot nowadays

1604
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,550
because of the commercialization
of of THC and CBD products

1605
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:19,529
and cannabis in a number
of different areas,

1606
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,269
including in the United States.

1607
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,240
But still, many people
are ingesting cannabis,

1608
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,220
THC, CBD through sources
where they don't really know

1609
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,107
how much they're bringing
into their system.

1610
01:08:28,107 --> 01:08:30,180
And so, whether or not someone

1611
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:34,080
gets incredible anxiety
relief, enhanced sense of mood

1612
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,109
and focus and wellbeing,
pain relief, et cetera,

1613
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:39,689
or whether or not they have
full blown panic attacks,

1614
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:42,959
et cetera, is very hard to predict

1615
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,240
based on dosage information alone.

1616
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,729
Now, of course, we can
create broad categories,

1617
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:48,929
and we are going to talk about studies

1618
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,569
that create broad categories
of low dose, moderate dose,

1619
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:54,959
and high dose. frequent
use and infrequent use,

1620
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,779
but unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,

1621
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:02,779
we can't really point to
specificity of X amount of alcohol,

1622
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,340
grams of alcohol per week, which is safe,

1623
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,740
or X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.

1624
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,260
And so I know a lot of people
out there are wondering,

1625
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:13,290
how often can they smoke cannabis,

1626
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,890
or how often can they eat
cannabis or THC or CBD

1627
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,240
in any number of its different
forms and products, safely?

1628
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,790
Well, we have to really
define what 'safely' means,

1629
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,260
and we have to really acknowledge

1630
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:29,460
that there's a pretty
loose set of controls

1631
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,550
over what one is bringing
into their brain and body

1632
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,220
as they ingest THC and CBD,

1633
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,490
but even under conditions in
which it's very controlled,

1634
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:41,069
it's very hard to predict
what those effects will be.

1635
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:43,259
So before moving into specifics

1636
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,899
of taking cannabis or not taking cannabis,

1637
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:46,799
who should, who shouldn't,

1638
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,317
what the medicinal purposes are

1639
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:52,620
and what some of the newer,
exciting data point to,

1640
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,939
I just briefly want to make a list,

1641
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,700
and I promise very briefly,
I know I'm not often concise,

1642
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,430
but I do try to be thorough for your sake.

1643
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:03,360
I want to make a very brief list
of the different brain areas

1644
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,600
that are impacted by THC and CBD

1645
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,203
and why THC and CBD have
the various effects they do.

1646
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,370
When somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,

1647
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:21,513
doesn't matter what the
THC or CBD ratio is,

1648
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,760
if they experience deficits in memory,

1649
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,540
and that's almost always
present, that's going to be

1650
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,910
because of reductions
in electrical activity

1651
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,430
within this brain region
we call the hippocampus.

1652
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:37,620
Hippocampus means seahorse.
It's shaped like a seahorse.

1653
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:40,440
Anatomists like to name things
after what things look like,

1654
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,470
but hippocampus memory, memory is reduced,

1655
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,030
in particular short-term memory.

1656
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,860
That's true regardless of whether or not

1657
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:51,003
one is using sativa indica or some hybrid.

1658
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:57,246
In general, the prefrontal
cortex is going to be activated

1659
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:00,090
by the sativa varieties, which
is going to increase thinking

1660
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,290
and narrowly constrain
focus to some activity,

1661
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,730
and that's more commonly associated

1662
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,080
with the sativa varieties.

1663
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,210
The indica varieties,
as I mentioned before,

1664
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:11,220
tend to lead to a suppression of activity

1665
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,470
in prefrontal cortex, believe it or not,

1666
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,660
and turn off thinking and planning.

1667
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,540
This is why indica
varieties are often used

1668
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,963
for relaxation and for promoting sleep.

1669
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:26,463
Regardless of whether or not
sativa or indica variety,

1670
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,780
and again, regardless of
the ratio of THC to CBD,

1671
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,780
there is a general
suppression of neural circuits

1672
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,000
within the so-called basal
ganglia and cerebellum.

1673
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,139
Basal ganglia and cerebellum
are areas of the brain

1674
01:11:38,139 --> 01:11:41,190
that are involved in action
planning and withholding action,

1675
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,330
so that would be the basal ganglia,

1676
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,880
so-called go, no go circuitry,

1677
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,430
and the cerebellum, which
is involved in balance,

1678
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:50,073
but also motor planning
and motor sequencing.

1679
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,265
This is why people who smoke marijuana,

1680
01:11:55,265 --> 01:11:57,090
regardless of the strain,

1681
01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:00,060
will tend to be less physically mobile.

1682
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,550
Other common effects are
reddening of the eyes,

1683
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,480
dryness of the mouth,

1684
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,330
that's actually caused by
the same general mechanism,

1685
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,360
which is a reduction in
the secretion of saliva

1686
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,450
and of tears and lubrication of the eyes

1687
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,220
from the lacrimal glands of the eyes

1688
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:17,820
because of the presence of largely CB2,

1689
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,420
but also CB1 receptors in
the mouth and on the eyes.

1690
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,370
And there tends to be,

1691
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,070
especially with certain
strains of cannabis,

1692
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,860
increase in appetite, so-called munchies,

1693
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:33,450
and that has everything to do
with very, very high density

1694
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,640
of CB1 receptors in the hypothalamus,

1695
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,380
and in particular areas
of the hypothalamus,

1696
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,498
like the arcuate nucleus
of the hypothalamus,

1697
01:12:39,498 --> 01:12:41,670
other areas as well, of course,

1698
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:46,440
that have tons of CB1
receptors, bind THC and CBD

1699
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,800
and activate the neurons that
strongly stimulate appetite

1700
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,610
through two mechanisms, one
is a cognitive mechanism

1701
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,860
of creating a preoccupation with food

1702
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,020
in anticipation of taste,

1703
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,910
as well as the experience of taste.

1704
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:04,017
So the narrowing of focus
to what you want to go eat.

1705
01:13:04,017 --> 01:13:06,900
You really crave, I dunno, pizza.

1706
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,700
It seems to be high fat,
high carbohydrate foods,

1707
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:13,550
but really crave pizza
and narrowing of focus,

1708
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,210
so that you're not thinking
about anything else,

1709
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:18,557
but also signaling from
the hypothalamus to the gut

1710
01:13:18,557 --> 01:13:21,360
to neurons within the stomach, itself,

1711
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,070
that regulate blood sugar,

1712
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:27,870
so there are strong effects
on blood sugar of THC and CBD

1713
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,000
that generally lead to
increases in appetite,

1714
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,730
so two parallel mechanisms,
one within the brain,

1715
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:34,920
one within the body, increasing appetite,

1716
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,567
so there's an array of different effects.

1717
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:40,020
And as I mentioned before,
CB1 receptors are present

1718
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,240
all over the nervous system
in the brain, the spinal cord.

1719
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,970
In fact, the presence of CB1
receptors in the spinal cord

1720
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:49,110
largely explains the fact that
THC and CBD, to some extent,

1721
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,370
although it's not very well studied,

1722
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:52,470
can provide some pain relief.

1723
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,411
I say some, because a
lot of people perceive

1724
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:58,530
or believe that they
experience more pain relief

1725
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,720
from cannabis than they actually do.

1726
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,300
It actually has a lot to
do with a perceptual shift

1727
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,950
to basically focusing on other things,

1728
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,400
but there does seem to
be some antinociceptive,

1729
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:13,020
meaning anti pain effects of
cannabis, THC in particular,

1730
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:17,063
and that is exerted largely
through effects on CB1 receptors

1731
01:14:17,063 --> 01:14:19,740
in neurons of the spinal cord.

1732
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,990
So a broad array of
effects are taking place,

1733
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,370
regardless of what strain you take

1734
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:25,530
and whether or not you eat the cannabis

1735
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,000
or you smoke the cannabis.

1736
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,030
And the broad array of effects
can be explained by the fact

1737
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:32,280
that that retrograde signaling
can lead to activation

1738
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,950
or suppression of activity
in various neurons.

1739
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,570
So now I'd like to take a step back

1740
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,090
from the biology of
cannabis and THC and CBD

1741
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:41,100
and all the signaling
and receptors, et cetera,

1742
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,160
and really just focus on cannabis use,

1743
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,330
and wherever possible,

1744
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:48,358
I will point to the specific
strains that have been studied

1745
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:51,240
and the ratios of THC to CBD,

1746
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,300
but I have to say that unfortunately,

1747
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,510
most studies of marijuana, of cannabis,

1748
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:59,850
while they have been very careful

1749
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,490
to detail the amount of THC,

1750
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,990
low dose, medium dose, or high dose,

1751
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,100
and actually getting very specific,

1752
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,390
right down to the number of milligrams

1753
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,340
or even how much
circulating THC is present

1754
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:13,340
after somebody smokes a
joint or ingests cannabis,

1755
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,990
most studies have not distinguished

1756
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:19,920
between sativa and indica strains.

1757
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,200
And that's unfortunate,
because in the real world,

1758
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,470
people are distinguishing
between sativa and indica strains

1759
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:27,300
in their patterns of
use and what they prefer

1760
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,133
and what they don't prefer,

1761
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:30,330
or even what they prefer
to smoke during the day

1762
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,680
or ingest during the day versus night.

1763
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,520
Believe it or not, there are people

1764
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,890
who are using certain
strains during the day

1765
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:36,240
and other strains at night,

1766
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,690
but the science is yet
to catch up to that,

1767
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:42,810
or I should say, more accurately,

1768
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:45,420
the general public and the
themes that are emerging

1769
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,000
and the practices that are
emerging around cannabis,

1770
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,270
especially in states where it's
decriminalized or legalized,

1771
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,650
are occurring at such a rapid rate

1772
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:53,820
that there's absolutely no way

1773
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,140
that the science could keep up.

1774
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,240
This is a naturally occurring experiment,

1775
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,130
not to say that it's natural,
like people should do it,

1776
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,200
but it's an experiment
that's happening in real time

1777
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:05,100
in the real world, much
faster than controlled studies

1778
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,390
within university laboratories

1779
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,980
and other laboratories can keep up.

1780
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,710
So at this point, I think it's
appropriate to ask ourselves,

1781
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,960
why do people even use cannabis?

1782
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,100
What are they trying to achieve?

1783
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,440
Is it always about not feeling pain?

1784
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,390
Is it always about reducing anxiety?

1785
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:19,320
Well, sometimes it is,

1786
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,540
but oftentimes people are using cannabis

1787
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,880
in order to achieve a particular state.

1788
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,897
And we could use a broad brush and say,

1789
01:16:25,897 --> 01:16:27,960
"Well, they just like being high,"

1790
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,693
but while that may be true
in a lot of circumstances,

1791
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,330
and I have to believe it actually is true

1792
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,460
in a lot of circumstances,

1793
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,920
there are a lot of people who use cannabis

1794
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,190
in a very directed way, or
they get, quote unquote, high,

1795
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:43,050
in order to achieve states

1796
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,300
that to them are particularly attractive,

1797
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,047
and one such state is
a state of creativity.

1798
01:16:49,047 --> 01:16:51,090
And this brings us to a broader theme,

1799
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:54,390
which is, does cannabis
increase creativity?

1800
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,760
And if so, is it the THC, the CBD,

1801
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,110
what's the appropriate ratio

1802
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:00,930
or the best ratio for
accessing creativity?

1803
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,880
This is an interesting and
important discussion, I believe,

1804
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,910
because creativity is one
of the more sought after

1805
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:08,850
and more elusive states
that humans can experience.

1806
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:11,220
And yet, if you look at human evolution,

1807
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,990
you look at our progression

1808
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,730
in terms of technology development

1809
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:18,759
and culture and music
and poetry, et cetera,

1810
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:21,720
we really can look to
creativity as the state

1811
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,600
that fostered so much of that evolution.

1812
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,490
So whether or not you're into technology,

1813
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,230
or you're into art or music,

1814
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,460
whether or not you're just somebody

1815
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,830
who wants to expand their understanding

1816
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:33,750
or their experience of life in some way,

1817
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,200
creativity is a
fundamentally important state

1818
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,480
to try and access and to
try and access regularly

1819
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,770
and to try and tap into,

1820
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:43,350
in order to eventually produce something,

1821
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,000
in order to create something of meaning

1822
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,070
that exists not just
in that creative state,

1823
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:51,000
but to yourself after that
creative state has gone away,

1824
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,920
so the painting that you
paint in the creative state

1825
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,650
hopefully is a painting
that still inspires

1826
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:57,968
and has impact after you
exit that creative state

1827
01:17:57,968 --> 01:18:00,510
and that will inspire others,
and this could be true

1828
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:03,270
for any number of different
things, not just painting.

1829
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:06,120
So does cannabis increase creativity?

1830
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,460
The short answer is, it depends.

1831
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,680
First of all, we need
to define creativity.

1832
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,810
Here we are, thinking as scientists,

1833
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:14,610
if not already scientists,

1834
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:17,370
and there are basically
two modes of thinking

1835
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,750
that are associated with creativity,

1836
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,450
and they don't completely
explain creativity.

1837
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:22,770
But if you look in the research,

1838
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:25,350
the psychology research and
the neuroscience research,

1839
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:28,440
you'll hear about convergent thinking

1840
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,733
and divergent thinking.

1841
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,410
Convergent thinking is taking loose ideas

1842
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,720
and kind of braiding them together,

1843
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,840
finding a common thread, synthesizing,

1844
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,940
and organizing those different ideas

1845
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:45,240
into some common or specific framework

1846
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:49,170
in order to get or create
some specific outcome.

1847
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:53,370
So convergent thinking is
basically the person in the room

1848
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:56,910
who's listening to all the
ideas and taking them all in.

1849
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:00,953
Maybe it's a panel of, how should we

1850
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:03,030
get a certain product out to market?

1851
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,120
Or what are the different motifs

1852
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,860
that we should include
in a piece of music?

1853
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,260
Or what should we do

1854
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:14,130
in terms of rearchitecting
a given physical space?

1855
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,630
Taking in those different opinions,

1856
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:17,550
those different ideas
from different people,

1857
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:20,070
and then synthesizing them and coming up

1858
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:23,490
with one or a small
subset of coherent ideas

1859
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:26,340
that incorporate some or all
of the ones that they heard,

1860
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:27,390
so that's convergent thinking.

1861
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:30,554
It doesn't have to involve a
panel of people talking to you.

1862
01:19:30,554 --> 01:19:32,790
I use that as an example

1863
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,530
of what goes on inside your own head

1864
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:36,240
when you are engaging
in convergent thinking.

1865
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,760
You're thinking, well,
so and so said this,

1866
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,710
and I think that, and
you're braiding them through

1867
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:43,290
and trying to get some common themes,

1868
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,990
some common vector to emerge from that.

1869
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:48,360
Divergent thinking, on the other hand,

1870
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,460
is best described as brainstorming.

1871
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,160
It's exploring ideas
and continuing to move

1872
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,880
into the variation and
the vastness of ideas

1873
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,040
in hopes of eventually
being able to converge

1874
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,306
on some novel idea or framework.

1875
01:20:01,306 --> 01:20:03,120
So these are similar and related,

1876
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,010
but typically the creativity process

1877
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:09,000
involves first brainstorming
and divergent thinking,

1878
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,280
and then in order to arrive at something,

1879
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,950
to actually create
something, the verb 'create,'

1880
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:17,130
not just thinking about
what you might create,

1881
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:18,420
which occurs during divergent thinking,

1882
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,240
but actually creating
something, a specific painting,

1883
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,500
a specific song, a specific
body of literature,

1884
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,623
a specific scientific project
or experiment and so on,

1885
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,970
that usually involves convergent thinking.

1886
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,640
Now these can be explored
in the laboratory,

1887
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,290
and they can be explored
in the laboratories

1888
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,270
through sets of different
types of questionnaires

1889
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:41,220
or even tasks that you
can give human subjects,

1890
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,320
and this has been done extensively

1891
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:47,100
and across the entire body of data,

1892
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,770
and by that I mean,
literally hundreds of studies

1893
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:50,940
that have explored the relationship

1894
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,160
between particular neuro
circuits and neurochemicals,

1895
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,860
convergent and divergent thinking.

1896
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,600
We can arrive at a principle,

1897
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,170
and the principle involves a molecule

1898
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,289
that many of you have heard
about before, which is dopamine.

1899
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:04,530
Dopamine is a neuromodulator.

1900
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:06,210
It's involved in motivation,

1901
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:07,500
and it tends to direct our attention

1902
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,980
to things outside of us, but
it's also closely related

1903
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,380
to convergent thinking
and divergent thinking

1904
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,120
and to the creative process.

1905
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,273
And therefore, it should
come as no surprise

1906
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:21,060
that diseases of the
nervous system, excuse me,

1907
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:23,130
such as bipolar disorder,

1908
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,830
which we've done in episode
all about bipolar disorder

1909
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:29,760
or schizophrenia or mood disorders

1910
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,800
that impact the levels of dopamine,

1911
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,880
either make it way, way too
high or way, way too low,

1912
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,550
strongly impact whether or
not people will be creative.

1913
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,250
And I think the short takeaway
that makes the most sense

1914
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,630
in terms of framing this,

1915
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:45,390
and we covered this on the
episode on bipolar disorder,

1916
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:48,780
sometimes called bipolar
depression, is that in professions

1917
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,880
where there's a lot of creativity required

1918
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,580
in order to succeed, so
again, musicians, composers,

1919
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:57,930
artists, et cetera, you tend
to find more manic depression,

1920
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:59,490
and manic depression,

1921
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:02,640
at least in the manic states,
the hyperactive states,

1922
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,523
are correlated with
elevated levels of dopamine.

1923
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:10,315
Likewise, it has been seen over
and over throughout history

1924
01:22:10,315 --> 01:22:13,530
that individuals that have
mild forms of schizophrenia,

1925
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:15,690
or even full-blown schizophrenia,

1926
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:18,960
many famous painters for
instance, or musicians,

1927
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,630
they are known to have
elevated levels of dopamine,

1928
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,770
and they are quite creative.

1929
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,540
Now, that doesn't mean
everybody who's creative

1930
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,310
has elevated levels of dopamine,

1931
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,530
although it's likely that
their levels of dopamine

1932
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:29,670
are at least not diminished,

1933
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,470
and it doesn't mean
that non-creative people

1934
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,580
have low levels of dopamine,

1935
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,830
so don't get carried away
with the interpretation here.

1936
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,494
But the point is this,

1937
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:41,130
dopamine levels strongly
relate to the probability

1938
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:44,010
that you can engage in convergent
and divergent thinking,

1939
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:45,870
and they do so in the following way.

1940
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:49,050
When dopamine levels are high,

1941
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,180
divergent thinking is more likely.

1942
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,310
That is, when people
have a lot of dopamine

1943
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,930
circulating in their system,

1944
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:57,510
they tend to be very
expansive with their ideas,

1945
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:58,710
they tend to brainstorm a lot,

1946
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:02,550
they tend to be comfortable
and even want to,

1947
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,060
or reflexively throw out a lot of ideas

1948
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,890
so that sometimes even
seem a little disconnected.

1949
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:09,180
Some people might think of this

1950
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,550
as attention deficit, but it's not.

1951
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:15,213
It's really the idea of
throwing out disparate ideas.

1952
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,570
You hear sometimes, you
throw things against the wall

1953
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:21,990
and see what sticks, that's
a obviously an analogy,

1954
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:25,170
but people are throwing lots
of things against the wall

1955
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,280
and seeing what stick,

1956
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,530
and then seeing how the things
that stick fit together,

1957
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:31,650
that's divergent thinking,
and elevations in dopamine

1958
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:34,080
tend to increase divergent thinking.

1959
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,700
However, they tend to do this
in an inverted U-shape way.

1960
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,900
For those of you either
watching on YouTube,

1961
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,360
I'm just drawing a hump, obviously,

1962
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,650
and for those of you listening,

1963
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,920
just imagine a U, the shape of a letter U,

1964
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,388
and then just flip it upside
down, so it looks like a bump.

1965
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:51,690
Turns out that when dopamine
levels are very low,

1966
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:53,850
there's a low probability
of divergent thinking.

1967
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:56,130
When dopamine levels are
high, as I mentioned before,

1968
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:59,190
there's a high level or
probability of divergent thinking.

1969
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:02,520
But when dopamine levels
go very, very high,

1970
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,520
then there's again, a reduction
in divergent thinking.

1971
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,890
In other words, there's a sweet spot

1972
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,350
of elevated dopamine
for divergent thinking.

1973
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,090
And again, divergent thinking

1974
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,550
is critical for the creativity process,

1975
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,650
because creativity by definition

1976
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:19,230
is taking a novel set of ideas

1977
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:21,240
and arranging them in a particular way,

1978
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,200
or taking existing ideas and
arranging them in a novel way

1979
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,820
that then you eventually converge

1980
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,733
on some new product, new
idea, new song, et cetera.

1981
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:34,572
Now, convergent thinking follows
a very different pattern.

1982
01:24:34,572 --> 01:24:36,540
When dopamine levels are high,

1983
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,600
convergent thinking is not very likely.

1984
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,370
And when dopamine levels are low,

1985
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:43,110
convergent thinking is very likely.

1986
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:47,070
So here, using arguably
a very reductionist view,

1987
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:49,410
we're looking at all of this
thing we're calling creativity

1988
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:51,720
through a very neurosciencey
reductionist lens,

1989
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,623
we can say this.

1990
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,530
The creative process
involves going into a state

1991
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:58,200
where you're willing to
consider a lot of options,

1992
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,970
many of which seem distantly

1993
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,680
or not even connected to one another,

1994
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,010
and dopamine facilitates
that divergent thinking state

1995
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:06,480
in which you are perfectly happy

1996
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:11,480
and in fact, experience a
joy, or elation, a comfort

1997
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:15,450
and a pleasure in organizing
all these different ideas

1998
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:19,170
that to anyone else might
seem not that related.

1999
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,937
But when your dopamine
levels are elevated,

2000
01:25:20,937 --> 01:25:22,257
these all seem like great ideas

2001
01:25:22,257 --> 01:25:24,390
and that maybe there
are connections there.

2002
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,460
You're not accepting all
of them as true and valid

2003
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:29,670
and interesting in combining
them, but there's this idea

2004
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:32,700
that it's worth entertaining
the possibility,

2005
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,440
at least for moments.

2006
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,070
And then, as dopamine levels drop,

2007
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,840
there is the process
of convergent thinking,

2008
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,087
which is taking options
down off the wall saying,

2009
01:25:43,087 --> 01:25:44,830
"No, no, that doesn't fit with that,

2010
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,027
"that doesn't fit with that,

2011
01:25:46,027 --> 01:25:48,337
"but ah, that fits with
that, and that can work.

2012
01:25:48,337 --> 01:25:52,260
"That feels right or sounds
right or looks right."

2013
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,027
That's the creativity process.

2014
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:56,880
And so, I think this is not just important

2015
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,320
for understanding cannabis,

2016
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,730
which we'll get back to in a moment,

2017
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:02,100
but it's important for
understanding creativity

2018
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,870
and brain states in general.

2019
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,730
Brain states are not, as we would say,

2020
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:06,630
a square wave function.

2021
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,700
You don't just drop into
a trench of creativity.

2022
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,392
Creativity is not an
event, it's a process.

2023
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:13,743
And what I'm telling you
is that it's a process

2024
01:26:13,743 --> 01:26:15,420
that involves divergent thinking

2025
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,130
and consideration of a
lot of different ideas.

2026
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,940
That's correlated with high
but not too high dopamine.

2027
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:24,342
And then, one has to
transition into a state

2028
01:26:24,342 --> 01:26:27,420
of convergent thinking,
which is really honing in

2029
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,790
on the ideas that seem to have validity

2030
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,080
or that could have validity

2031
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,400
and getting rid of everything else,

2032
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,500
and that's associated with low dopamine.

2033
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,710
It's more about logical
implementation and consideration

2034
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:40,920
as opposed to thinking about
and considering everything.

2035
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,390
So let's now return to the question

2036
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:43,890
of whether or not cannabis

2037
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:46,983
and its different components
increase creativity.

2038
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,250
And when you look at
the literature on this,

2039
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,880
you find studies that very
clearly point to a yes,

2040
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,760
it increases creativity,
and it's not surprising,

2041
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,990
therefore, that cannabis can
increase dopamine transmission,

2042
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,390
that is dopamine levels,
in certain brain areas,

2043
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:07,050
in particular brain areas
involved in thinking and planning.

2044
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:09,450
So cannabis increases
dopamine in these areas.

2045
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:12,000
Elevated dopamine increases
divergent thinking,

2046
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,340
and divergent thinking is
associated with creativity,

2047
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,380
and there are studies
that support the idea

2048
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:20,280
that cannabis can increase creativity.

2049
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,730
However, there are at
least as many studies

2050
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:26,760
that say that cannabis does
not increase creativity,

2051
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,120
that cannabis increases
consideration of multiple ideas,

2052
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,870
perhaps through elevation of
dopamine and related systems,

2053
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:36,900
but that ultimately the
ideas that converge from that

2054
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,370
are not truly creative ideas,

2055
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:39,720
at least they don't meet the criteria

2056
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,340
for creative brainstorming

2057
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,130
and extraction of ideas
that are truly novel,

2058
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:48,060
so it doesn't increase
creativity, so which one is it?

2059
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:48,893
Well, fortunately,

2060
01:27:48,893 --> 01:27:51,510
there's an entirely
distinct set of literature

2061
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:54,750
that has taken all the other
literature into consideration,

2062
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,340
and here's where we arrive.

2063
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:57,600
So there's a really nice study

2064
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,600
that explored creativity
in cannabis users,

2065
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,337
and we will provide a link to this study.

2066
01:28:02,337 --> 01:28:04,560
First author is Emily LaFrance,

2067
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,930
and the title of the paper,

2068
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,760
somewhat amusing in its own right,

2069
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,800
which is, it starts with a question,

2070
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,600
inspired by Mary Jane, of course,

2071
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,976
Mary Jane being one of
the old school versions

2072
01:28:14,976 --> 01:28:18,420
or ways of talking about
cannabis or marijuana.

2073
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,640
Nowadays, people refer
to it mainly as pot,

2074
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,780
as other names too, of course,

2075
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:23,557
and the title of the paper is,

2076
01:28:23,557 --> 01:28:26,137
"Inspired by Mary Jane
Mechanisms Underlying

2077
01:28:26,137 --> 01:28:28,200
"Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users."

2078
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,870
And I really like this study
for a couple of reasons.

2079
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:35,870
First of all, they looked at
people who did not use cannabis

2080
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,700
as well as people who used cannabis,

2081
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,930
so they had two different groups,

2082
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:44,790
but they did not evaluate
creativity of the cannabis users

2083
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,250
while they were under the
influence of cannabis.

2084
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:50,047
They looked at the level of creativity

2085
01:28:50,047 --> 01:28:52,590
in these cannabis users

2086
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:55,410
when they were not under
the influence of cannabis

2087
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:58,320
and asked whether or not
their ability to be creative

2088
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,700
was enhanced by cannabis.

2089
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,860
Now we're going to compare this to studies

2090
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,930
in which people come into the laboratory

2091
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:04,830
and actually use cannabis,

2092
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:08,246
and then they evaluate
creativity under that context.

2093
01:29:08,246 --> 01:29:10,680
But this study has some unique takeaways

2094
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,910
that I think are really interesting.

2095
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:14,430
First of all, they did, yes,

2096
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:16,920
see evidence for enhanced creativity,

2097
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,390
and when I say enhanced creativity,

2098
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:21,397
I mean within the context of
this divergent thinking thing

2099
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,253
that I talked about a moment ago.

2100
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,620
And when I say enhanced,

2101
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:28,050
I mean significantly
greater than in non-users,

2102
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,970
so people that don't use cannabis.

2103
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:32,062
So right now I can imagine
that all the cannabis users

2104
01:29:32,062 --> 01:29:35,137
are cheering, "Yes, cannabis
increases creativity,

2105
01:29:35,137 --> 01:29:37,800
"makes people more creative
than they would be otherwise."

2106
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,450
Well, this is interesting.

2107
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,960
We have to ask ourselves
how that was accomplished.

2108
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,670
And it turns out that
one of the major ways

2109
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:47,640
in which it was accomplished
is that cannabis users,

2110
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,060
even if they're not under
the influence of cannabis,

2111
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:54,150
are far more open to novel ideas,

2112
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:58,980
and they have a more
explorative and reduced anxiety,

2113
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,470
or I should say lower
anxiety mode of thinking

2114
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:02,880
when they explore novel ideas,

2115
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,860
which is essential for divergent thinking.

2116
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:07,440
So they observed both enhanced divergent

2117
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,440
and convergent creative type
thinking in cannabis users.

2118
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:16,830
And the source of that, they conclude is,

2119
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,957
and here, I'll just quote,
"Cannabis users' higher levels

2120
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,937
"of openness to experience are responsible

2121
01:30:21,937 --> 01:30:23,677
"for their enhanced
self-reported creativity

2122
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:26,070
"and convergent thinking
test performance."

2123
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:29,130
So it's not necessarily that cannabis

2124
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,410
is increasing the capacity
of the brain areas

2125
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:33,960
that are associated with creativity,

2126
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:38,960
but rather, cannabis appears
to be increasing an openness

2127
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:42,510
and probably doing that in
part through lowering anxiety

2128
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:45,330
in particular people, and that openness

2129
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:48,630
is leading to inclusion of more ideas

2130
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:51,210
during the divergent thinking process.

2131
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,860
They're willing to consider throwing up

2132
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,950
more things on the wall to see
if they stick, so to speak.

2133
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,380
So in their conclusions, they
have a really nice statement.

2134
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,210
Again, I'll just read from the paper,

2135
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:02,587
because they said it better
than I ever could, quote,

2136
01:31:02,587 --> 01:31:04,957
"While mainstream media
has propagated the idea

2137
01:31:04,957 --> 01:31:08,377
"that cannabis expands the
mind and enhances creativity,

2138
01:31:08,377 --> 01:31:10,927
"our results show the link
between cannabis and creativity

2139
01:31:10,927 --> 01:31:13,680
"is largely a spurious correlation,"

2140
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,080
meaning that it's not the case

2141
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:20,997
that cannabis increases creativity, but,

2142
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:23,703
and I inserted the 'but' in this quote,

2143
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,507
but "driven by differences in personality

2144
01:31:28,507 --> 01:31:30,547
"that are related to cannabis use.

2145
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:33,037
"For example, openness to
experience that are related

2146
01:31:33,037 --> 01:31:36,265
"to both cannabis use and
augmented creativity."

2147
01:31:36,265 --> 01:31:39,603
This is a real chicken/egg
argument. What do I mean by that?

2148
01:31:39,603 --> 01:31:42,600
What I mean is, this paper finds

2149
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,080
that people who are
more open to experience

2150
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,330
are more likely to use cannabis,

2151
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:49,950
and people who use cannabis

2152
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:53,460
are going to be more
open to new experiences,

2153
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:56,880
and that combination of
features, openness to experience,

2154
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,480
and what that openness to
new experiences brings,

2155
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,720
enhances the convergent
and divergent thinking

2156
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,780
that is characteristic
of the creative process.

2157
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:10,080
So in short, cannabis
increases creativity,

2158
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,450
but through changes in personality

2159
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,760
that tap into the creative process,

2160
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,220
rather than directly
impacting the neural circuits

2161
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,120
that, for instance, turn on creativity.

2162
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,270
And I have to say, this
study is really important,

2163
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:28,410
because by exploring cannabis users,

2164
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,900
not while under the influence of cannabis,

2165
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,990
they were able to tap
into this very important,

2166
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,090
what I believe to be fact.

2167
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,560
Because if you think about a study

2168
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,470
in which you would have
one group using cannabis

2169
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,120
and another group not using cannabis,

2170
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:44,910
and then you give them some
task that taps into creativity,

2171
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:46,770
you will see effects and very likely,

2172
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,900
you'll see effects where
cannabis might even increase

2173
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:51,090
divergent and convergent
thinking and creativity.

2174
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:52,350
Those results have actually been published

2175
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:53,850
many times before.

2176
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:56,213
But given the varied
effects of cannabis and THC

2177
01:32:56,213 --> 01:32:57,570
that we talked about earlier,

2178
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,640
through all of that
complex signaling stuff,

2179
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,950
you can imagine that there
will also be other studies,

2180
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,300
and in fact, there are,

2181
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:06,750
where divergent and convergent
thinking and creativity

2182
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,240
is not assisted by cannabis

2183
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:12,000
and might even be reduced
by ingesting cannabis.

2184
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,820
However, if one considers
that divergent thinking

2185
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:18,690
is absolutely crucial to
the creativity process

2186
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:21,690
and the range of things
that one will explore

2187
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:24,330
will be enhanced by openness

2188
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:26,850
and by reduced levels of anxiety,

2189
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,800
so a willingness to
explore different options,

2190
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,230
some of which might seem completely crazy,

2191
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:34,290
and cannabis increases
the personality types

2192
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:38,100
and reduces the anxiety that
create that sense of openness,

2193
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,048
well then it makes perfect sense

2194
01:33:39,048 --> 01:33:42,111
why cannabis would increase creativity

2195
01:33:42,111 --> 01:33:45,330
in certain individuals, but not directly.

2196
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:47,970
And this study, the
one I just referred to,

2197
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:49,230
which I should say was published

2198
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,940
in the journal,
"Consciousness and Cognition,"

2199
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:53,070
and again, we'll provide a link to it,

2200
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:55,950
did a wonderful job of teasing out

2201
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:58,920
this impact of cannabis on personality,

2202
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,320
which then impacts creativity.

2203
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:03,480
So if somebody asks you,
or if you're wondering,

2204
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,600
or if you feel like cannabis
increases creativity,

2205
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,130
in some sense the answer is 'yes,'

2206
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:10,290
but the answer is 'yes'
because of the ways

2207
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:13,140
that it shapes openness to new ideas

2208
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:16,020
and can, I should say 'can,'
because not in everybody,

2209
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,848
but can, in some
individuals, reduce anxiety.

2210
01:34:18,848 --> 01:34:21,990
What this means is that
if you are somebody

2211
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:26,990
who experiences anxiety or
increased levels of focus

2212
01:34:27,253 --> 01:34:30,998
from cannabis, regardless of the strain,

2213
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,010
and here I have to imagine people

2214
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:33,360
are exploring different strains,

2215
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,520
if they're exploring them at all,

2216
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,900
exploring different modes of delivery,

2217
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,730
smoking or ingestible, et cetera.

2218
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:41,670
If you're somebody who
experiences anxiety,

2219
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:46,180
it's very likely that you won't
have the increased openness

2220
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,470
to experience and divergent ideas

2221
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:50,880
that will facilitate creativity.

2222
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,430
However, if you are somebody
who achieves heightened levels

2223
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:57,630
of relaxation and reduced
levels of anxiety from cannabis,

2224
01:34:57,630 --> 01:35:00,450
regardless of which strain we
happen to be talking about,

2225
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:03,090
well then, yes, it will position you

2226
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:05,790
to be in a heightened state of creativity,

2227
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:08,550
at least as defined by convergent
and divergent thinking.

2228
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,200
One of the more characteristic,

2229
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,920
or I should say stereotype
qualities of people

2230
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,650
that smoke a lot of
marijuana or ingest cannabis

2231
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:20,340
through other means is there
changed patterns of speech.

2232
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:25,340
In fact, there's a lore
in the clinical realm

2233
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:29,430
that you can predict or
get some strong indication

2234
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,740
as to whether or not
somebody is a cannabis user

2235
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:34,563
or pot smoker based on their voice

2236
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:37,230
and their particular tone of voice

2237
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:39,270
and their lack of inflection.

2238
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:40,710
There's a lot of speculation here,

2239
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:42,390
but fortunately, it's been studied.

2240
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,680
So I'd like to discuss now

2241
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,770
whether or not cannabis can
impact patterns of speech,

2242
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:50,100
both acutely, meaning while
under the influence of cannabis,

2243
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,670
and over time, in chronic cannabis users.

2244
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,200
And when I say 'chronic cannabis use,'

2245
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,820
I want to be very specific what I mean.

2246
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:59,040
Chronic cannabis use
does not necessarily mean

2247
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,270
that people are smoking cannabis

2248
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,100
or ingesting cannabis every day,

2249
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,060
although certainly if they are,

2250
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,370
that qualifies as chronic use.

2251
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:07,800
Chronic use is regular use over time

2252
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,230
of anywhere from twice a week or more.

2253
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:11,850
So using cannabis once a month

2254
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,350
would not be considered chronic use,

2255
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,570
even if it's for many, many years.

2256
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:17,190
Using cannabis or ingesting cannabis

2257
01:36:17,190 --> 01:36:19,290
in some way or form twice a week

2258
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:21,450
would be considered chronic use.

2259
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:22,830
Then of course, some of you out there

2260
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:24,247
are going to ask me to
split hairs and say,

2261
01:36:24,247 --> 01:36:26,610
"Well, what if somebody
uses it twice a month?"

2262
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:28,890
Well, listen, the clinical literature,

2263
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:31,500
and the scientific literature
don't get that specific.

2264
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,360
And of course, they're an
infinite number of ways

2265
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,610
to arrange one's cannabis use,

2266
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:37,470
everything from zero, none at all,

2267
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:41,220
to constantly, every day, all
day and everywhere in between.

2268
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:45,000
But think of chronic use
as twice a week or more.

2269
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,670
Think of occasional use as less than that

2270
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:51,390
and realize that within the
realm of chronic use, excuse me,

2271
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:54,390
that 'or more' can be
anywhere from twice a week,

2272
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:57,123
to every day, to just in
the evenings, et cetera.

2273
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,503
The effects of chronic use of cannabis,

2274
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,903
as I just defined it, on
speech have been studied.

2275
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,140
Because of this characteristic,

2276
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:14,700
drawing out of certain
syllables, a slowing of speech,

2277
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:19,170
and in many cases a total
change or alteration

2278
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:22,613
in the way that people
speak and use language,

2279
01:37:22,613 --> 01:37:25,650
both when under the influence of cannabis

2280
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:28,080
and when not under the
influence of cannabis

2281
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,880
if they're chronic users.

2282
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,930
And here we really want to
distinguish between THC and CBD

2283
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:35,670
and just make it really simple and say

2284
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:39,180
that CBD is not responsible

2285
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:41,970
for most of the psychoactive
effects of cannabis,

2286
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:44,130
whereas THC is, and again,

2287
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:47,220
the ratio of CBD to THC is
going to be relevant there,

2288
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:50,010
but let's just think
about cannabis and THC

2289
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:52,890
as one in the same for this
portion of the discussion,

2290
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:53,723
realizing that, of course,

2291
01:37:53,723 --> 01:37:55,680
they are not exactly the same thing.

2292
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,247
There's an excellent study entitled,

2293
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,647
"Adults with History of
Recreational Cannabis Use

2294
01:37:59,647 --> 01:38:01,860
"Have Altered Speech Production,"

2295
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:02,880
and we will provide a link to that,

2296
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,060
first author, Adam Vogel,
really like this paper.

2297
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,627
It was published in the journal,

2298
01:38:07,627 --> 01:38:09,205
"Drug and Alcohol Dependence."

2299
01:38:09,205 --> 01:38:11,880
We will provide a link to it for you

2300
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:14,370
if you'd like to peruse it in more detail.

2301
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:17,197
The title itself, "Adults
with a History of Recreational

2302
01:38:17,197 --> 01:38:20,070
"Cannabis Use Have Altered
Speech Production,"

2303
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:22,290
tells you pretty much
everything you need to know,

2304
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,750
except there's some
important nuance in here,

2305
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,850
because, as I mentioned earlier,

2306
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:30,180
people who smoke sativa
varieties of cannabis

2307
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:34,440
oftentimes will become more
talkative, much more talkative.

2308
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,350
However, whether or
not people tend to rely

2309
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:42,350
on sativa cannabis use
or indica cannabis use,

2310
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:44,970
there is a very consistent finding

2311
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,320
that people who are chronic users,

2312
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,060
again twice a week or more,

2313
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,760
recreational use or medicinal use,

2314
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,360
undergo pretty profound changes
in the way that they speak,

2315
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,930
but in a very specific set of ways.

2316
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:00,660
Now, first of all, the changes in speech

2317
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,640
shouldn't surprise us at all,

2318
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,760
because both sativa varieties of cannabis

2319
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,130
and indica varieties of cannabis

2320
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:10,860
impact those brain centers
involved in movement,

2321
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,680
the basal ganglia, remember
the go, no-go circuitry,

2322
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,510
the circuitry that makes
you want to do things,

2323
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:18,150
and the circuitry that makes
you want to withhold action?

2324
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:21,090
And it tends to shift the body and brain

2325
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:23,294
toward more inaction.

2326
01:39:23,294 --> 01:39:27,210
And cannabis impacts CB1
receptors in the cerebellum,

2327
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:31,170
which is involved in motor
planning, execution and balance.

2328
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:32,970
So, regardless of whether or not people

2329
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:37,560
are using cannabis of the
sativa or the indica variety,

2330
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,510
there are disruptions in motor circuitry.

2331
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:40,920
And, as you may have heard,

2332
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,150
if you listened to our episode

2333
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:45,360
with Rockefeller professor,
Dr. Erich Jarvis,

2334
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:50,360
who works on speech and
movement, speech is movement.

2335
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:53,190
The movements of the mouth,
the movements of the hands,

2336
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,890
those are intimately related
in terms of our speech.

2337
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:58,950
In fact, the centers of the
brain involved in hand movements

2338
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:01,865
are part of the speech
areas and vice versa.

2339
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:03,210
Erich actually pointed out

2340
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,100
that if you put your
hands behind your back,

2341
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,290
provided you normally do
have use of your hands,

2342
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:10,047
it actually will reduce
your fluidity of speech,

2343
01:40:10,047 --> 01:40:12,383
and so I'm going to put them
back in front of me now.

2344
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:18,300
The point is, smoking marijuana
or consuming marijuana

2345
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:21,540
by edible changes one's speech

2346
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,100
and does it in a very specific way.

2347
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,670
And in this study by Adam
Vogel and colleagues,

2348
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:30,510
they explored a huge different
variety of aspects of speech.

2349
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:32,700
And this can be done
using spectral processing,

2350
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,230
which is fancy nerd speak

2351
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:36,480
for looking at how much
inflection there is

2352
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,760
or looking at how long people hold vowels

2353
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,290
or consonants, et cetera, and again,

2354
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,840
these are people not under
the influence of cannabis,

2355
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:45,720
but rather people who tend
to be under the influence

2356
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,080
of cannabis when not
participating in the study,

2357
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,390
in other words, chronic
recreational cannabis users.

2358
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:54,236
So what are the two major
shifts that cannabis causes

2359
01:40:54,236 --> 01:40:56,100
on our patterns of speech?

2360
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,960
Well, the first one is a change

2361
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,970
in what's called spectral tilt.

2362
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,170
Again, that's fancy nerd speak

2363
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:03,780
for vocal effort and intensity.

2364
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:06,753
So, I'm not a pot smoker, I confess,

2365
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:10,893
but if I were to say the sentence,

2366
01:41:11,767 --> 01:41:13,357
"Vocal effort and intensity

2367
01:41:13,357 --> 01:41:16,200
"are important components of speech,"

2368
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,000
that's the way I would say that sentence

2369
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,520
if I was striving to
enunciate very carefully

2370
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:24,210
and to accent certain words and syllables.

2371
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:28,560
A pot smoker or somebody who
uses recreational cannabis

2372
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,193
fairly often would have
reduced spectral tilt,

2373
01:41:32,193 --> 01:41:36,416
AKA, vocal effort
intensity, and might say,

2374
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:39,187
[mumbling] "Spectral tilt is
vocal effort in intensity,

2375
01:41:39,187 --> 01:41:41,287
"and it differed between
groups and appeared to change

2376
01:41:41,287 --> 01:41:44,880
"in line with the duration of
abstinence from cannabis use."

2377
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,130
That I think is not a far cry

2378
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:49,530
from the change in spectral
tilt that they observed here.

2379
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:54,120
In addition, there are
changes in verbal timing,

2380
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,670
that is pronunciation of words

2381
01:41:56,670 --> 01:42:00,240
and accenting particular
syllables of words

2382
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:04,740
in people that consume
cannabis or smoke cannabis.

2383
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:09,360
So rather than emphasize
particular words within a sentence,

2384
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,280
so again, I'll just use
a sentence from the paper

2385
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,447
so that you can gain more
knowledge from the paper,

2386
01:42:13,447 --> 01:42:16,050
"Cannabis," and I'll say it
the way that I would say it,

2387
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:18,937
since I'm not a cannabis user.

2388
01:42:18,937 --> 01:42:21,397
"Cannabis, marijuana, is
the most commonly used,

2389
01:42:21,397 --> 01:42:24,667
"illicit drug in the world with
approximately 4% of adults,

2390
01:42:24,667 --> 01:42:27,607
"aged 15 to 64 years reporting recent use,

2391
01:42:27,607 --> 01:42:30,037
"and the citation is from
the United Nations Office

2392
01:42:30,037 --> 01:42:33,030
"on Drugs and Crime, 2019."

2393
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,050
So that would be the way

2394
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:35,940
that I would typically read that sentence.

2395
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:38,460
And having gone into
the data on this paper,

2396
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:41,160
and of course evaluated references therein

2397
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,220
and listened to some of
the spectral analysis

2398
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:46,200
that they include as data,

2399
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,970
you can literally go
into these papers online

2400
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:51,270
and hear recordings of
people who are cannabis users

2401
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:52,800
or non-cannabis users,

2402
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,350
and I'll try and give you a a clear sense

2403
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:58,620
without picking an extreme
example of how somebody

2404
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:02,550
who's a fairly consistent or
even occasional cannabis user

2405
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,300
might read that very same sentence.

2406
01:43:05,908 --> 01:43:08,917
"Cannabis, marijuana, is
the most commonly used

2407
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:12,547
"illicit drug in the world
with approximately 4% of adults

2408
01:43:12,547 --> 01:43:15,757
"age 15 to 64 years reporting recent use,

2409
01:43:15,757 --> 01:43:18,277
"and the citation comes from
the United Nation Office

2410
01:43:18,277 --> 01:43:21,000
"on Drugs and Crime in 2019."

2411
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,490
Now you'll notice that
wasn't a dramatic difference.

2412
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,500
And, of course I could
have taken the liberty

2413
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,210
to pick an extreme example of the sort

2414
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:29,520
that they did occasionally observe

2415
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,770
in evaluating subjects for this paper.

2416
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:33,548
I could have said something like,

2417
01:43:33,548 --> 01:43:34,627
[mumbling in low tone]
"Cannabis, marijuana,

2418
01:43:34,627 --> 01:43:36,450
"is the most commonly used illicit drug,"

2419
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:39,360
but frankly that would've been
selecting an outlier example,

2420
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,230
and I don't want to do that.

2421
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:42,720
I don't want to skew the data as they say.

2422
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:47,070
Rather, if you heard the
first time I read the sentence

2423
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:48,300
and the second time I read the sentence,

2424
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,900
what's mainly different is the difference

2425
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:55,170
in the amount of enunciation and accenting

2426
01:43:55,170 --> 01:43:57,510
of particular words and
symbols within a sentence.

2427
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:00,390
So the total content that's
delivered is exactly the same,

2428
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:02,580
and while I wasn't measuring my pace,

2429
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:07,380
the overall rate of communication
is essentially the same,

2430
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:10,410
but there's less lilting
and falling of the voice

2431
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:11,280
and less accenting.

2432
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,370
That's the major consistent
effect of cannabis use.

2433
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:16,350
Now of course, there
are examples of people

2434
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:18,660
who are using a lot of cannabis,

2435
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:20,250
and it impacts brain centers

2436
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,750
involved in movement and speech,

2437
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,880
so much so that they really do have

2438
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,610
the really drawn out kind of, nah,

2439
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:29,130
and oftentimes this will
be detected in the laugh.

2440
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:31,890
There's this stereotypical stoner laugh,

2441
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:33,060
as it's sometimes called.

2442
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,380
Rather than say "Ha, ha, ha"

2443
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:36,720
or that's a fake laugh, obviously.

2444
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:37,890
It's hard to make myself laugh

2445
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:38,970
if something's not actually funny.

2446
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:40,380
I'll have to think of something funny.

2447
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:41,370
When people say like, "Ha!"

2448
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:43,380
That's a bit more of
the way I might laugh,

2449
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,870
like, "Ha," sort of the inspiratory laugh

2450
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:48,510
or the, "Ha," which is expiratory laugh.

2451
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:50,250
People who use cannabis chronically

2452
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:53,988
will often do that, "Haa,"
which is the back of the throat,

2453
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:57,270
[laughs raspingly] it's
neither inspiratory

2454
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:59,040
nor expiratory laugh,
and believe it or not,

2455
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,060
there's an entire literature

2456
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:03,030
on inspiratory, inhaling,
versus expiratory laughs,

2457
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:06,177
and there's also a literature on cannabis

2458
01:45:06,177 --> 01:45:09,450
altering the pattern of
inspiratory and expiratory laughs.

2459
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,820
It almost sounds like a sarcastic laugh

2460
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:14,370
when, in fact, they may not
be feeling sarcastic at all.

2461
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:16,920
And I have a very close
friend and colleague

2462
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:19,290
who's a phenomenal
neurosurgeon and neuroscientist

2463
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:20,520
by the name of Dr. Eddie Chang.

2464
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,290
He's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,

2465
01:45:22,290 --> 01:45:25,890
and his lab and him
are expert in the study

2466
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:29,610
of neuroscience controlling
language and speech.

2467
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:34,140
And he often tells me that he can predict,

2468
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,280
with almost certainty,

2469
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,250
whether or not somebody
is a regular cannabis user

2470
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:42,330
based, not just on the patterns
of speech that they use,

2471
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:45,330
but even just by recording
specific neurons in their brain

2472
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:47,910
that underlie the laugh reflex

2473
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:49,470
and certain patterns of speech.

2474
01:45:49,470 --> 01:45:52,560
So this idea that cannabis
use changes your ability

2475
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,860
to speak and enunciate clearly
does appear to be true.

2476
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:58,590
And the stereotype that cannabis use

2477
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:00,690
tends to create more of a drawl

2478
01:46:00,690 --> 01:46:04,830
or, if you will, a laziness in the laugh,

2479
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:08,040
and some of the reflexive
enunciations that people use,

2480
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,300
does also appear to be true.

2481
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,000
And I say all that, of
course, with the caveat

2482
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,060
that many people out there
will know individuals

2483
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:18,000
or perhaps you,
yourselves, are individuals

2484
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,230
that may use cannabis but that
have incredible articulation,

2485
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:23,340
probably better than mine

2486
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,690
and better than other people out there

2487
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:26,850
who speak for a living, so I'm not saying

2488
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:29,640
that 100% of people that
use cannabis regularly

2489
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,350
can't speak well or clearly.

2490
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:33,030
That's simply not what I'm saying,

2491
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:35,550
and I don't want to
communicate that idea at all,

2492
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:36,660
but it is the case that people

2493
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:38,760
who are regular cannabis users

2494
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,370
are impacting the neural
circuits involved in movement.

2495
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:43,140
Movement also controls speech,

2496
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:46,440
and therefore, cannabis
is impacting speech.

2497
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,580
Now I'd like to turn our attention

2498
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:51,120
to whether or not cannabis
can increase sexual activity,

2499
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:54,480
sexual desire, and/or sexual function,

2500
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,600
so we're going to be talking
about libido, about sexual desire

2501
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,630
and about effects of cannabis on hormones.

2502
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,700
And while this might
sound like a discussion

2503
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:06,120
that's purely oriented towards
recreational use of cannabis,

2504
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:08,430
that is people using
cannabis to heightened

2505
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:12,060
or increase their sense of
arousal for sexual activity,

2506
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,610
it actually ventures into
the clinical realm too,

2507
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:17,640
meaning there have been
excellent peer-reviewed studies

2508
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,110
that I'll describe to you in a moment

2509
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:22,616
exploring the use of cannabis
or THC, more specifically,

2510
01:47:22,616 --> 01:47:27,030
for something called hypoactive
sexual desire disorder,

2511
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:30,450
which refers to a persistent
or recurrent deficiency

2512
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:32,760
or absence of sexual
fantasies and thoughts

2513
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,320
and/or desire for, or
receptivity to, sexual activity.

2514
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,660
This is a disorder that is fairly common,

2515
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:43,620
anywhere from 6% to 9% of
people, both males and females.

2516
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,320
It used to be considered higher prevalence

2517
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,330
in females than in males,

2518
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:50,790
but now those numbers
seem to be evening out.

2519
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:54,480
So basically, there are
anywhere from 6% to 9%

2520
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:58,389
of people out there who have
very diminished sexual desire.

2521
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:00,450
And so, a number of those people

2522
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:02,160
are interested in figuring out ways

2523
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,290
to increase their amount of sexual desire,

2524
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:07,230
and of course, there are people
in the general population

2525
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:10,710
who may not have hyperactive
sexual desire disorder

2526
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:13,350
who are interested in using
cannabis recreationally

2527
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:15,630
in order to increase their desire for,

2528
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:18,570
or their experience of, sexual activity.

2529
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:19,890
Now first we have to acknowledge

2530
01:48:19,890 --> 01:48:21,810
that sexual desire and activity

2531
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:24,120
is a complex set of processes,

2532
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,720
meaning it's not just
one event, sex, the verb.

2533
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:31,770
It involves arousal, it
involves sex, the verb,

2534
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:35,370
and it involves a whole set of
mindsets and emotional states

2535
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:37,830
that vary tremendously
between individuals.

2536
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:41,505
But once again, we can distill
out a few basic principles,

2537
01:48:41,505 --> 01:48:43,560
and I should emphasize,

2538
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,827
these are by no means the only chemicals

2539
01:48:44,827 --> 01:48:48,330
and neuro circuits
involved in the sexual arc,

2540
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:51,750
as we'll call it, desire,
the act of sex, et cetera,

2541
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,300
but they are central to
it, they are vital to it.

2542
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,560
They would be considered

2543
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:58,470
what I would call necessary
but not sufficient,

2544
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:00,300
so there'll be other
chemicals involved too,

2545
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,800
but the main chemicals in neuro circuits

2546
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,540
are those involved in dopamine,

2547
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:05,850
so the so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway,

2548
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:08,760
in particular, a brain structure
called nucleus accumbens,

2549
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,410
which we'll talk about more in a moment,

2550
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:14,460
is vital to all motivated
behaviors and to the seeking out

2551
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,610
of all particular types of
pleasurable experiences,

2552
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:18,990
and sex is no exception.

2553
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,990
So when we hear that the
nucleus accumbens is activated,

2554
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:24,120
that almost always means that dopamine

2555
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,830
has been released in that area

2556
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:27,570
and other areas of the brain body,

2557
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:29,550
and we can consider dopamine central

2558
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:34,539
to the desire for,
pursuit of, an act of sex.

2559
01:49:34,539 --> 01:49:38,580
In addition to that, there
are molecules like oxytocin,

2560
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,050
which are involved in pair bonding,

2561
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:41,580
and they're going to be
neural circuit specific

2562
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,620
to the oxytocin circuitry,

2563
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:47,400
but in terms of sexual
arousal and sexual behavior,

2564
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,160
it's really the dopamine pathway
in this nucleus accumbens,

2565
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:52,297
which are especially vital.

2566
01:49:52,297 --> 01:49:54,600
That allows us to address the question,

2567
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:58,890
does cannabis increase, decrease,

2568
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:01,680
or have no effect on sexual desire

2569
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:04,680
and/or the ability to have sex?

2570
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:08,700
And therein, we will find
some very interesting answers,

2571
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:10,590
and because, once again,

2572
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:14,760
it will point to the fact
that the effects of cannabis

2573
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:18,060
on different individuals
can be highly divergent,

2574
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:20,310
meaning in one set of individuals,

2575
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:22,770
cannabis will make them far less anxious.

2576
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:24,450
And in another set of individuals,

2577
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:26,790
the same strain of cannabis,
at the same dosage,

2578
01:50:26,790 --> 01:50:28,350
will make them extremely anxious.

2579
01:50:28,350 --> 01:50:31,980
The same can be said
also of sexual activity.

2580
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:33,990
And this was beautifully illustrated

2581
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:36,697
in the context of sexual
desire in the journal,

2582
01:50:36,697 --> 01:50:39,450
"Psycho-pharmacology," in
a paper published in 2017.

2583
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:43,267
The title of this paper is,
"Individual Prolactin Reactivity

2584
01:50:43,267 --> 01:50:46,897
"Modulates Response of Nucleus
Accumbens to Erotic Stimuli

2585
01:50:46,897 --> 01:50:51,051
"During Acute Cannabis
Intoxication, an fMRI Pilot Study."

2586
01:50:51,051 --> 01:50:53,610
So I'll give a little bit of definition

2587
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:54,750
to some of the terms in the title

2588
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:57,660
that will make it easier for
you to understand the paper,

2589
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,160
but then I'll just march
through the results,

2590
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,660
because they're very straightforward

2591
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:03,390
and easy to understand
and very interesting.

2592
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,570
fMRI is just functional
magnetic resonance imaging,

2593
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:09,300
so basically subjects in this experiment

2594
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:12,060
came into the laboratory.

2595
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:16,230
They were either people who
had not used cannabis before

2596
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:18,849
or who had used cannabis before.

2597
01:51:18,849 --> 01:51:20,970
They were placed into a brain scanner,

2598
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:22,680
one of these fMRI devices.

2599
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:25,802
It looks like a tube that
people are backed up into

2600
01:51:25,802 --> 01:51:27,267
and then they can view images in there,

2601
01:51:27,267 --> 01:51:28,830
and their brain can be imaged

2602
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:30,360
without having to remove any skull

2603
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,410
or drill into the skull, no neurosurgery.

2604
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,850
The participants in
this study were grouped

2605
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,710
according to whether or
not they had experienced

2606
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:39,185
any aphrodisiac effects

2607
01:51:39,185 --> 01:51:41,790
during the intoxication with cannabis,

2608
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:43,770
so that would be the first group, Group A,

2609
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,960
they literally called it
group A for aphrodisiac.

2610
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,070
And then the second group,

2611
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:48,840
and this is the only thing I
don't like about this study,

2612
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:50,340
is rather than call it group B,

2613
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,710
they called them 'group non A,'

2614
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:54,750
which just gets a little confusing.

2615
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,460
So I'll try and simplify all this.

2616
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,870
There are two groups,

2617
01:51:57,870 --> 01:52:02,220
and one group experiences sexual arousal

2618
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:06,270
when under the influence of
cannabis, THC specifically.

2619
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:07,590
The other group does not.

2620
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:12,060
And it turns out this is a very
commonly observed divergence

2621
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:14,310
of effects of cannabis.

2622
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:16,860
Some people experience
a lot of sexual arousal

2623
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:20,610
from cannabis and THC in
particular, and some people do not,

2624
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:24,120
in fact, they experience
suppression of sexual desire,

2625
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,950
and it's always been a
little bit mysterious

2626
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:27,990
as to why that is.

2627
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:31,770
Well, in this study, they showed people

2628
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:33,750
in both groups erotic images,

2629
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,940
and they measured sexual arousal

2630
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:36,990
through a number of different measures.

2631
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:37,890
We won't go into all that.

2632
01:52:37,890 --> 01:52:39,360
It was largely subjective.

2633
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,290
There have been other studies

2634
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:42,090
where they've actually measured things

2635
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:45,822
like erections in males and
vaginal lubrication in females,

2636
01:52:45,822 --> 01:52:49,533
so-called autonomic responses
that people can't lie about,

2637
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,360
so to speak, and that
tap into other aspects

2638
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:57,690
of the so-called sexual arousal process.

2639
01:52:57,690 --> 01:52:59,790
In this study, they
also took blood samples

2640
01:52:59,790 --> 01:53:03,210
to look at the concentration
of things like cannabinoids,

2641
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:04,470
so this is a really nice study

2642
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:06,964
in that they actually
measured how much THC

2643
01:53:06,964 --> 01:53:09,720
was in the bloodstream
in different individuals

2644
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:12,450
who reacted to these erotic
stimuli in different ways.

2645
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:15,240
And they measured
hormones, namely cortisol,

2646
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:16,320
which is a stress hormone,

2647
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,850
which tends to negatively correlate

2648
01:53:17,850 --> 01:53:20,580
with sexual arousal and prolactin.

2649
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:23,610
And the interesting
takeaway from the study was

2650
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:25,830
that for people, and it didn't matter

2651
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:28,580
if it was males or females,
'cause they looked at both,

2652
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:34,964
for people that experienced
elevated prolactin levels

2653
01:53:34,964 --> 01:53:39,300
under cannabis intoxication,
that's how they refer to it.

2654
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,010
People take cannabis,
they measured prolactin.

2655
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:43,960
Some people had elevated
prolactin and some people did not.

2656
01:53:44,966 --> 01:53:48,033
For the people that had
elevated levels of prolactin,

2657
01:53:49,230 --> 01:53:51,570
they did not observe activation

2658
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:54,390
of brain areas associated
with sexual arousal,

2659
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:56,460
in this case, the right nucleus accumbens,

2660
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,860
so you have two nucleus accumbi,

2661
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:00,780
I guess they would be called,
one on each side of the brain,

2662
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,510
and the activation of that brain area

2663
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:05,550
is strongly associated with
dopamine and with arousal

2664
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:07,920
and sexual arousal in
particular in this study,

2665
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,020
and if people had elevated prolactin,

2666
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,930
they did not experience
activation of nucleus accumbens,

2667
01:54:12,930 --> 01:54:15,450
and they did not report
feeling sexually aroused

2668
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:17,370
to those pictures, at least
not to the same degree

2669
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:18,540
as the other group.

2670
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:20,670
So some people's prolactin levels go up

2671
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:22,710
when they ingest cannabis,

2672
01:54:22,710 --> 01:54:25,920
and those people do not
achieve elevated levels

2673
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:29,400
of sexual arousal when under
the influence of cannabis,

2674
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,738
even if they're looking at erotic stimuli.

2675
01:54:31,738 --> 01:54:35,790
That makes sense, because prolactin

2676
01:54:35,790 --> 01:54:39,150
is mutually inhibitory, as we would say.

2677
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:41,070
It's kind of in a push-pull with dopamine.

2678
01:54:41,070 --> 01:54:42,330
When dopamine levels are high,

2679
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:44,610
prolactin levels tend to be low,

2680
01:54:44,610 --> 01:54:46,200
and when prolactin levels are high,

2681
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,030
dopamine levels tend to be low.

2682
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:50,580
The other group, so-called Group A,

2683
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,520
that experienced elevated
levels of sexual arousal

2684
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,260
when under the influence of cannabis

2685
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:56,913
and viewing erotic stimuli,

2686
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:01,620
that group did not show
elevated levels of prolactin

2687
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,840
in response to cannabis.

2688
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:04,860
So this, I believe,

2689
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:08,070
resolves a longstanding
controversy in the field,

2690
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:11,340
which is, does cannabis
increase sexual arousal?

2691
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:12,330
Well, it depends.

2692
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:14,250
If you fall into the category of person

2693
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:15,990
who has elevated levels of prolactin

2694
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:20,160
in response to cannabis,
then no, actually cannabis

2695
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,921
will suppress your sexual
response and desire.

2696
01:55:22,921 --> 01:55:26,048
If, however, you are in
the category of person

2697
01:55:26,048 --> 01:55:29,850
that does not have elevated
levels of prolactin

2698
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:31,740
in response to cannabis,

2699
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:35,130
well then, erotic stimuli can potentially

2700
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:37,800
and in fact, do increase sexual arousal

2701
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,360
in the majority of individuals.

2702
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,860
Now, many of you are probably hearing this

2703
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:42,600
and wondering whether or not you fall

2704
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:45,900
into one category of
individual or another.

2705
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:48,990
And the key thing here to understand

2706
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:53,130
is that levels of prolactin
heading into the study

2707
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:57,950
did not predict whether or
not people would respond

2708
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:02,340
to cannabis with elevated or non elevated

2709
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:04,980
or even reduced levels of sexual arousal.

2710
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:08,730
It was whether or not people's
prolactin levels went up

2711
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:11,310
or did not go up, that predicted

2712
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:14,730
whether or not their levels
of arousal would go up or not.

2713
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:17,130
So if you are somebody who, yes,

2714
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:20,460
does experience elevated
levels of sexual arousal

2715
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:23,610
and function went under
the influence of cannabis,

2716
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,200
well that's very likely that cannabis

2717
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,910
does not increase your prolactin levels,

2718
01:56:26,910 --> 01:56:30,510
at least not to a significant
degree while you're taking it.

2719
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:33,180
And if you're somebody who
does not experience increases

2720
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:35,070
in sexual arousal or function

2721
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:36,783
or even diminished sexual
arousal and function

2722
01:56:36,783 --> 01:56:38,400
when under the influence of cannabis,

2723
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:39,780
it's very likely that cannabis

2724
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:41,760
is increasing your levels of prolactin.

2725
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:44,370
Unfortunately, there's
no way to know or predict

2726
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:46,410
based on some other measure.

2727
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,880
I think the outcome measure,

2728
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:50,160
that is increased or not increased

2729
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:53,040
or even reduced sexual arousal
is really the litmus test

2730
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,990
by which one can figure that out.

2731
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:57,240
While we are on the topic
of the effects of cannabis

2732
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:00,360
on sexual function and
hormones like prolactin,

2733
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,680
it's probably worth mentioning

2734
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,110
that cannabis has been studied extensively

2735
01:57:04,110 --> 01:57:06,300
for its impact on other hormones,

2736
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:09,990
and we can summarize those
literature in the following way.

2737
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:12,090
And here I'm referring to
studies only on adults.

2738
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:13,860
We'll talk about the
developing brain and body

2739
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:17,430
in a little bit, but it is very clear

2740
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:22,430
that smoking cannabis
increases prolactin levels.

2741
01:57:22,978 --> 01:57:24,480
Very, very clear.

2742
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,277
Now, you might say, "Didn't,
you just describe a study

2743
01:57:27,277 --> 01:57:31,477
"about a set of individuals
whose prolactin didn't increase

2744
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:33,067
"and as a consequence,

2745
01:57:33,067 --> 01:57:35,790
"their level of sexual desire went up?"

2746
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:37,560
Yes, there are a subset of individuals

2747
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:42,370
for which that's true, but
people who smoke cannabis

2748
01:57:42,370 --> 01:57:45,420
do experience increases in prolactin,

2749
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:47,190
and that's especially pronounced in people

2750
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:49,800
that smoke cannabis
more than twice a week.

2751
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:54,450
So this is important, prolactin,
as I referred to earlier,

2752
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:59,450
is reciprocal or mutually
inhibitory with dopamine.

2753
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:01,530
One way to think about
this is in the context

2754
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:03,630
of the normal sexual arousal arc

2755
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:05,430
whereby dopamine is increased

2756
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:09,600
when people are sexually
aroused, but then after orgasm,

2757
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:12,840
both in males and females,
prolactin levels skyrocket.

2758
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,400
This is actually what creates

2759
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,410
the so-called refractory period for males

2760
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:18,420
during which they cannot
achieve erection again

2761
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:19,620
for some period of time.

2762
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:22,380
That relates directly to how long

2763
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:24,603
the prolactin increase lasts.

2764
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:30,270
Prolactin is also increased
in new parents of all species,

2765
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:35,100
including humans, which
at least partially,

2766
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:38,520
explains some of the reported
or typical reductions

2767
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:41,070
in sexual desire and
activity in new parents.

2768
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:42,240
Now, there are other reasons for that too,

2769
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,090
sleep deprivation, but nature is smart

2770
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:47,400
and has arranged a set
of hormones and circuits

2771
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,650
in the brain and body,
such that when tending

2772
01:58:49,650 --> 01:58:53,160
to a newborn is the most
important thing, it relegates,

2773
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:57,840
it reduces the importance
of producing more children

2774
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,090
and sexual activity in those moments

2775
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:01,950
and days and weeks, sometimes longer.

2776
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:04,560
So when prolactin levels are
up, dopamine levels are down.

2777
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,570
Smoking marijuana more than twice a week

2778
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:09,060
significantly increases prolactin.

2779
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:11,400
There are fewer studies exploring

2780
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:14,280
whether or not edible
marijuana has the same effect,

2781
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:18,210
although the preliminary evidence
suggests that it does not.

2782
01:59:18,210 --> 01:59:21,210
I get into this in a lot more
detail in a future episode,

2783
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:24,120
all about hormones with Dr. Kyle Gillett,

2784
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:25,950
who's been on this podcast before.

2785
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:28,410
But he verified that, and
my read of the literature

2786
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:33,410
is that the edible forms
of marijuana, cannabis,

2787
01:59:33,476 --> 01:59:37,080
probably again, let's put
an asterisks next to this,

2788
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:39,480
but it appears do not have as as much

2789
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,100
of a prolactin elevating effect

2790
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:45,030
and therefore, not as much of
a dopamine suppressive effect

2791
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:46,200
and therefore, not as much

2792
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,390
of a testosterone suppressing effect,

2793
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:50,040
and that gets to the
issue of testosterone.

2794
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,770
Does cannabis, marijuana
suppress testosterone?

2795
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:55,720
And this is a very controversial
literature and here's why.

2796
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:59,980
Some studies say, "Yes,
it suppresses testosterone

2797
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:02,670
"in males and females," and keep in mind

2798
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:04,770
that testosterone in
females is vital for libido

2799
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:08,430
and cognitive function,
cellular repair, et cetera,

2800
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:11,400
so it's not just important
in males, of course.

2801
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:14,370
However, other studies say that cannabis

2802
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:16,530
does not decrease testosterone,

2803
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:20,490
and it seems to depend on
whether or not the cannabis

2804
02:00:20,490 --> 02:00:23,670
is brought into the system
by way of smoking or edible.

2805
02:00:23,670 --> 02:00:27,210
And it seems to depend on
whether or not the cannabis

2806
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:30,030
is used chronically by
an individual or acutely.

2807
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:31,980
And here I just want to zoom out and say

2808
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:35,190
that studies on cannabis or
drugs of any kind in humans

2809
02:00:35,190 --> 02:00:36,240
are really complicated.

2810
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:37,080
If you think about it,

2811
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,850
someone has to come into the laboratory,

2812
02:00:38,850 --> 02:00:41,542
and let's say you want to
study chronic cannabis use.

2813
02:00:41,542 --> 02:00:43,980
Well, you can't keep them in
the laboratory all the time,

2814
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:45,720
so you have to rely on their self-report

2815
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:47,940
of how often they use
cannabis and in what form,

2816
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:50,430
and you can't really control
from one individual to the next

2817
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:51,990
of how much cannabis and THC

2818
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:52,950
they're bringing into their system.

2819
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:55,650
One person might smoke
cannabis out of a bong

2820
02:00:55,650 --> 02:01:00,590
and take big, deep, lungs-full
bong inhalations or such.

2821
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:04,590
Other people might smoke joints.

2822
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:06,150
Other people might use edibles.

2823
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:08,460
It becomes very complicated
to know what people have done

2824
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,350
and that they're reporting it accurately,

2825
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:12,990
and no joke here, especially if marijuana

2826
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:15,000
is impacting the
short-term memory systems.

2827
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,170
They might not actually remember.

2828
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:18,660
They might not be tracking it that well.

2829
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,970
Contrast that with
studies of the acute use

2830
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:24,090
of cannabis and THC, where
people who are not regular users

2831
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:26,550
come into the laboratory and now suddenly,

2832
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:29,580
with institutional guidelines
and safety protocols,

2833
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:31,770
are under the influence
of THC and cannabis.

2834
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:32,970
Well, now you're dealing with a person

2835
02:01:32,970 --> 02:01:37,170
who may not have experience
with the elevated heart rate

2836
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:38,687
and blood pressure that's
characteristic of cannabis,

2837
02:01:38,687 --> 02:01:40,140
'cause it is a stimulant,

2838
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:42,090
at least when initially
brought into the system,

2839
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:44,430
even if it might eventually
lead to relaxation.

2840
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:45,840
So now you've got someone who's anxious

2841
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,780
or somebody who's not
anxious, who's deeply relaxed,

2842
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:50,040
and you're trying to study these effects,

2843
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,410
so it's a moving target of sorts,

2844
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:55,940
and it's very complicated to
study marijuana and cannabis

2845
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,810
in its various derivatives in this way.

2846
02:01:57,810 --> 02:01:59,910
Now you can probably appreciate better

2847
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:02,580
as to why there's so little nuanced data

2848
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,830
about sativa versus indica,

2849
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:08,010
versus different ratios of CBD and THC.

2850
02:02:08,010 --> 02:02:09,810
It's really difficult to do these studies

2851
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:10,650
in the first place.

2852
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:12,270
That said, the general rules

2853
02:02:12,270 --> 02:02:14,940
are smoking marijuana increases
prolactin in men and women,

2854
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:17,310
which will reduce
dopamine and testosterone.

2855
02:02:17,310 --> 02:02:19,643
Smoking marijuana chronically,

2856
02:02:19,643 --> 02:02:22,232
meaning more than twice a week,

2857
02:02:22,232 --> 02:02:25,320
does appear to reduce
testosterone significantly

2858
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,886
and elevate so-called aromatase enzymes,

2859
02:02:27,886 --> 02:02:29,310
which are the enzymes

2860
02:02:29,310 --> 02:02:31,560
that convert testosterone into estrogen.

2861
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,401
This might partially explain the effect

2862
02:02:33,401 --> 02:02:38,400
that occurs in about 35% of
males, which is gynecomastia,

2863
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,100
which is a development of
breast tissue in males,

2864
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:42,690
in particular young males,

2865
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:44,550
who have elevated levels of testosterone

2866
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:47,370
or who are taking exogenous testosterone

2867
02:02:47,370 --> 02:02:49,350
for testosterone replacement therapy

2868
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:51,780
or if they're taking high
doses, anabolic steroids,

2869
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:55,380
or in females, the
increase in breast size,

2870
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:58,230
which is due to additional estrogen

2871
02:02:58,230 --> 02:02:59,940
from testosterone converted to estrogen.

2872
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,800
So it does appear that
marijuana and cannabis

2873
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:04,890
increase estrogen, reduce
testosterone, increase prolactin,

2874
02:03:04,890 --> 02:03:07,470
especially in chronic users.

2875
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:09,030
Now, I'm sure that some
people out there will say,

2876
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:12,330
well, their testosterone
levels are exceedingly high

2877
02:03:12,330 --> 02:03:15,450
or they are fine, meaning
the constellation of symptoms

2878
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:18,230
associated with low testosterone
and elevate estrogen

2879
02:03:18,230 --> 02:03:20,160
are not present in them.

2880
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:24,810
That probably means one
of two things, or both.

2881
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:27,090
They either had elevated
levels of testosterone

2882
02:03:27,090 --> 02:03:28,740
to begin with, so their
ceiling was higher,

2883
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:30,660
so bringing it down didn't
have that much of effect,

2884
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:33,510
or that they have very low levels

2885
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:35,640
of aromatase in their system.

2886
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:38,220
There are some anecdotal evidence

2887
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:41,220
that smoking particular
parts of the marijuana plant,

2888
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:45,420
in particular, the seeds,
can increase aromatase

2889
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:47,430
in the conversion of
testosterone to estrogen.

2890
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:48,540
I think in the old days,

2891
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:50,580
the lore was the seeds make you sterile,

2892
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:52,710
and I think that was related
to what I just told you,

2893
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:55,830
this increase in conversion
of testosterone to estrogen.

2894
02:03:55,830 --> 02:03:57,570
There's a vast literature

2895
02:03:57,570 --> 02:04:00,833
on the effects of cannabis on fertility.

2896
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:05,220
Yes, it does seem to alter sperm motility

2897
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:06,660
and sperm health and function

2898
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:08,850
when taken chronically,
more than twice per week,

2899
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:12,270
in particular high doses
of high potency THC.

2900
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:14,310
This is something we will
cover in far more detail

2901
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:16,440
on a future episode all about fertility.

2902
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:19,560
And in females, there's
an increase in estrogen

2903
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:22,470
as a consequence of smoking marijuana

2904
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:26,430
and increasing prolactin
and estrogen in parallel.

2905
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:29,070
Whether or not that's
detrimental isn't clear,

2906
02:04:29,070 --> 02:04:33,152
although I point out that
elevated estrogen and prolactin

2907
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:36,210
can be associated,
again, can be associated,

2908
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:38,670
not necessarily, and
certainly, not causative,

2909
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:41,003
but can be associated with elevated levels

2910
02:04:41,003 --> 02:04:43,620
or frequency of breast cancer detection.

2911
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:46,080
So cannabis and its effects on hormones

2912
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:47,643
are not without consequence.

2913
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:50,370
There are effects of cannabis

2914
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:53,070
on cortisol in some individuals.

2915
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:55,650
It greatly increases
cortisol due the anxiety

2916
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:58,020
and paranoia it can create,

2917
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:00,330
and in other individuals
it reduces cortisol.

2918
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:02,250
Again, we have these divergent effects.

2919
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,890
But I want to be very clear,
the effects on prolactin,

2920
02:05:04,890 --> 02:05:07,080
meaning elevated prolactin,
the effects on testosterone,

2921
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:09,120
meaning, at least most studies point to,

2922
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:12,510
reduced levels of testosterone
and increased estrogen.

2923
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:15,420
That seems to be true
for most all individuals

2924
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,760
that chronically use cannabis,

2925
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,420
whereas the effects on
cortisol tend to be divergent.

2926
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:23,670
Cannabis increases cortisol
in some individuals

2927
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:25,290
and decreases cortisol in others.

2928
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:28,680
In general, increases in
cortisol that are ongoing

2929
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:31,606
are not healthy for us and so on.

2930
02:05:31,606 --> 02:05:34,530
And then of course, there are
other effects on hormones,

2931
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:35,940
and I'll just briefly summarize those,

2932
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:39,870
that THC in particular, not
CBD, but THC in particular,

2933
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:41,670
is known to be strongly inhibitory

2934
02:05:41,670 --> 02:05:43,980
for something called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

2935
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,020
This is a hormone that's
released from the brain,

2936
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:49,500
from the hypothalamus
that then feeds onto,

2937
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,690
or I should say signals
to the pituitary gland,

2938
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:53,010
which is also near the roof of your mouth,

2939
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:54,510
a lot of stuff happening
near the roof of your mouth

2940
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:56,100
it turns out, biologically,

2941
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:59,250
and reduced levels of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone

2942
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:00,510
caused by cannabis use,

2943
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,850
reduced levels of LH luteinizing hormone

2944
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:05,910
and FSH, which reduce
levels of testosterone

2945
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:10,910
and sperm production in males
and egg health and ovulation

2946
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:14,970
and menstrual function in females.

2947
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:17,880
Now, I'm sure there are a
number of women out there

2948
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:19,920
who will say they have perfectly
normal menstrual cycles

2949
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:22,140
despite using cannabis.

2950
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:24,540
I'm certainly not going to dispute that,

2951
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:28,170
but if you are somebody who's
trying to maximize fertility

2952
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:30,870
or regulate or balance hormones,

2953
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:34,369
marijuana and cannabis reduces GnRH.

2954
02:06:34,369 --> 02:06:38,070
That is the gonadotropin-release
from the hypothalamus

2955
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:40,740
and thereby reduces luteinizing hormone

2956
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,240
and follicle stimulating hormone,

2957
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,830
which are released from the pituitary

2958
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:45,510
and travel in the bloodstream

2959
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:48,600
to support normal ovarian
function and health

2960
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:51,120
and normal testicular function and health

2961
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:53,250
in females and males, respectively.

2962
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:55,350
Up until now I've been
discussing the biological

2963
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:57,960
and psychological effects of cannabis.

2964
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,460
Now I'd like to shift our attention

2965
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:02,550
to some of the negative
health effects of cannabis

2966
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:05,490
and shine light on some of the individuals

2967
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:08,910
or groups out there that
need to be especially wary of

2968
02:07:08,910 --> 02:07:11,730
and probably avoid cannabis use entirely,

2969
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:16,230
including ingestion of
cannabis by way of edible.

2970
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:17,310
And I frame things that way,

2971
02:07:17,310 --> 02:07:20,070
because I think there is an
increasingly large number

2972
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:24,720
of people out there that
appreciate that smoking tobacco

2973
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:29,040
or smoking cannabis, vaping tobacco,

2974
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,833
yes, vaping tobacco, or vaping cannabis,

2975
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,720
each and all have negative
health consequences on the lungs

2976
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:39,390
and on the so-called
endothelial cells of the body,

2977
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:41,250
the cells that make up the vasculature,

2978
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:43,380
the capillaries and blood vessels.

2979
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:46,920
If you don't already know
this, I'll make it very clear,

2980
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,630
and I'll make it very brief.

2981
02:07:48,630 --> 02:07:53,460
Whether or not you smoke or
vape tobacco or cannabis,

2982
02:07:53,460 --> 02:07:57,510
you are severely impairing the
function of endothelial cells

2983
02:07:57,510 --> 02:07:59,850
that make up the capillaries
and blood vessels

2984
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:01,230
of your brain and body,

2985
02:08:01,230 --> 02:08:05,850
and that is known to decrease
cognitive capacity over time,

2986
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:07,650
increase probability of strokes,

2987
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:11,040
severely impact lung function,

2988
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:14,400
and also lead to things like
peripheral neuropathies.

2989
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,320
It leads to sexual dysfunction,

2990
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:19,710
because of lack of blood
flow to the genitals,

2991
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:22,530
can lead to other aspects
of reproductive damage,

2992
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:24,780
including to the ovaries and testes.

2993
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:27,270
Essentially, there is no
other way to state it,

2994
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:30,060
except that smoking and vaping

2995
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:32,520
have negative health consequences

2996
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:35,753
that are independent of the substances

2997
02:08:35,753 --> 02:08:39,030
that people are trying to
get into their bloodstream

2998
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:40,320
by smoking or vaping.

2999
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,000
So people smoke and vape tobacco,

3000
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,660
and people smoke and vape
cannabis, and in both cases,

3001
02:08:45,660 --> 02:08:49,050
if we just set aside the
direct effects of tobacco

3002
02:08:49,050 --> 02:08:52,440
and the direct effects of cannabis,

3003
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:56,100
we can confidently say that
the process of smoking,

3004
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:57,810
of inhaling smoke into the lungs,

3005
02:08:57,810 --> 02:09:02,220
and yes, also vaping,
bringing the chemicals

3006
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:05,730
that transport nicotine,
or in this case, cannabis,

3007
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:07,280
into the lungs by way of vaping

3008
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:11,550
are both severely detrimental
to endothelial cells.

3009
02:09:11,550 --> 02:09:14,400
I think a few years ago, when
vaping wasn't as prominent,

3010
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:16,380
there was this question and this idea

3011
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,870
that maybe vaping was
going to be far healthier

3012
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:22,650
or at least not as bad as smoking,

3013
02:09:22,650 --> 02:09:24,900
but now we can see a huge number

3014
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,490
of negative health effects of vaping,

3015
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:29,250
some of which are distinct
from the effects of smoking.

3016
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:32,340
So if you'd like more information
on smoking versus vaping,

3017
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:34,290
please see the episode
that I did on nicotine.

3018
02:09:34,290 --> 02:09:36,120
We will also do an entire episode

3019
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,640
all about vaping in the future,

3020
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,400
but there's really no way
to slice it and dice it

3021
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:42,630
or candy coat it.

3022
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:45,600
The fact of the matter
is that smoking has clear

3023
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:48,630
and severe negative health
consequences, regardless of

3024
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:52,863
whether or not you're smoking
tobacco or cannabis, THC,

3025
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:57,810
and vaping has negative
health consequences,

3026
02:09:57,810 --> 02:10:00,750
whether or not you're using
the vape to bring in nicotine

3027
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:04,290
or THC or some combination of THC and CBD.

3028
02:10:04,290 --> 02:10:05,580
That's simply the way it is.

3029
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:07,740
With that said, now I'd
like to focus our attention

3030
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:10,500
on the direct effects that cannabis has,

3031
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:15,180
either by way of THC action
or by way of CBD action

3032
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:18,270
in terms of positive or
negative health effects

3033
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:20,850
on the brain and body, and
we're going to explore that

3034
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:22,920
first as a function of age.

3035
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:24,600
And the reason we're going to do that

3036
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:26,550
is related to a fact that I mentioned

3037
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:27,990
at the beginning of the episode,

3038
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:31,560
which is that the CB1
and the CB2 receptors,

3039
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:36,560
the two receptors for cannabis
to which THC and CBD and CBN

3040
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:40,800
and all other psychoactive
compounds of cannabis bind to

3041
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:45,360
to have their actions are
present throughout development.

3042
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:46,200
Believe it or not,

3043
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:49,380
they are present very
soon after conception,

3044
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:53,610
and the CB1 and CB2 receptors
actually play a critical role

3045
02:10:53,610 --> 02:10:55,800
in the development of the fetus.

3046
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:58,440
Now, you might wonder why that is,

3047
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:00,450
because of course, the developing fetus

3048
02:11:00,450 --> 02:11:02,610
doesn't necessarily expect to see cannabis

3049
02:11:02,610 --> 02:11:05,880
or to be exposed to
cannabis and THC and CBD.

3050
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:10,650
But, as you recall, endogenous
cannabinoids are present

3051
02:11:10,650 --> 02:11:14,370
in the adult brain and body
and endogenous cannabinoids,

3052
02:11:14,370 --> 02:11:16,980
it turns out, are also present
in the developing fetus.

3053
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:19,590
In fact, endogenous
cannabinoids are present

3054
02:11:19,590 --> 02:11:22,200
at much greater levels
in the developing fetus

3055
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:25,890
than they are after a child is born,

3056
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:27,840
and levels of endogenous cannabinoids

3057
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,270
actually go down across development.

3058
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:31,560
I find this really interesting.

3059
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:34,110
What this means is that
endogenous cannabinoids

3060
02:11:34,110 --> 02:11:37,050
and activation of the
CB1 and CB2 receptors

3061
02:11:37,050 --> 02:11:40,350
are an integral part
of neural development,

3062
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:42,240
and this is going to
become especially relevant

3063
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:44,160
in considering whether
or not pregnant mothers

3064
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:47,939
should or should not use cannabis or CBD,

3065
02:11:47,939 --> 02:11:51,280
and it also points to some
very interesting biology

3066
02:11:52,258 --> 02:11:54,330
in terms of how the brain develops

3067
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:55,680
and how the body develops.

3068
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:58,950
Now the development of the brain
and nervous system and body

3069
02:11:58,950 --> 02:12:01,170
is a fascinating and vast literature,

3070
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:04,170
certainly far too vast to
cover in today's episode,

3071
02:12:04,170 --> 02:12:06,900
especially at this late hour as it were,

3072
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,820
but we will have a future episode

3073
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:10,860
all about brain development.

3074
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:13,740
In terms of the effects of cannabis,

3075
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:17,370
it's sufficient to say
that cannabinoid receptors

3076
02:12:17,370 --> 02:12:21,180
are present and active
in the developing fetus.

3077
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:23,520
They're present and active in the newborn.

3078
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,040
They're present and active in adolescence.

3079
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:30,120
And across that time, from
conception until adolescence,

3080
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:32,850
endogenous cannabinoids
are mainly responsible

3081
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:35,970
for the actions of those
cannabinoid receptors.

3082
02:12:35,970 --> 02:12:37,950
During that time, the
cannabinoid receptors

3083
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:39,810
are having very specific effects

3084
02:12:39,810 --> 02:12:42,330
that are distinct from
their effects later in life,

3085
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:44,220
and those effects can largely be explained

3086
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:45,540
in terms of neural development.

3087
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:49,200
Again, we don't have time for
an entire lecture on this now,

3088
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:51,630
but during development,

3089
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:54,330
your body was a collection
of a bunch of cells.

3090
02:12:54,330 --> 02:12:55,980
It's actually called a blastula,

3091
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:58,110
which means a ball of
cells, and then those cells

3092
02:12:58,110 --> 02:12:59,760
actually have to grow out connections

3093
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:01,410
and duplicate themselves,

3094
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:03,270
and this is a very interesting process

3095
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:06,150
by which neurons initially
are situated far apart,

3096
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:07,710
and then they grow out connections

3097
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:09,030
and make contacts with one another.

3098
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:10,320
They remove certain connections,

3099
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:13,290
depending on what kind of
life events you're exposed to.

3100
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:15,570
If you have a wonderful
event early in life

3101
02:13:15,570 --> 02:13:17,490
or a traumatic early life,

3102
02:13:17,490 --> 02:13:19,383
those connections change, et cetera.

3103
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:21,870
The important point for today's discussion

3104
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:25,110
is that the CB1 receptor, in particular,

3105
02:13:25,110 --> 02:13:28,710
is expressed on every neuron
in the developing brain

3106
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:30,060
and has been shown to be important

3107
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:33,090
for every aspect of neural development,

3108
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:35,190
from the proliferation of cells,

3109
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:37,530
meaning getting enough
cells to create a brain,

3110
02:13:37,530 --> 02:13:40,050
to the outgrowth of the so-called axons,

3111
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:43,260
the little wires that connect
up neurons with one another,

3112
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:45,780
to the steering, the direction

3113
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:50,640
which those axons go in
development, which is essential,

3114
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:54,240
and even so far as to
explain the connections

3115
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:56,730
that form between neurons,
the so-called synapses,

3116
02:13:56,730 --> 02:13:58,710
and then how those synapses work.

3117
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:02,970
So the basic statement here is
that endogenous cannabinoids

3118
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:05,130
and CB1 receptor activation are critical

3119
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:08,588
for every aspect of brain
wiring and development.

3120
02:14:08,588 --> 02:14:11,430
With that in mind, the
statement I'm about to make

3121
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:14,190
is absolutely terrifying, at least to me,

3122
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:17,010
and frankly, it should be
terrifying to you as well.

3123
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:21,750
And the statement is,
the current statistics

3124
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:26,750
on cannabis use in pregnant
mothers is absolutely shocking.

3125
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:29,870
The most recent survey of pregnant mothers

3126
02:14:29,870 --> 02:14:33,848
in the United States
show that 15%, one-five,

3127
02:14:33,848 --> 02:14:37,650
15% of pregnant mothers
report using cannabis

3128
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:40,500
in some form or another, either smoking it

3129
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:43,890
or more likely ingestion of in edible,

3130
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:45,690
because they are aware
of the negative effects

3131
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:49,080
of smoking on the developing
fetus, ingestion of an edible

3132
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:53,580
to increase THC and/or
CBD during pregnancy,

3133
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:55,380
which to me, I have to say,

3134
02:14:55,380 --> 02:15:00,380
as a developmental neurobiologist
is, frankly, it's scary.

3135
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:03,600
It's absolutely scary,
because that CB1 receptor

3136
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,360
is not just a minor player
in neural development.

3137
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:09,480
It is absolutely central
to every critical aspect

3138
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,550
of brain wiring and development.

3139
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:12,990
Now, the long-term implications

3140
02:15:12,990 --> 02:15:14,910
or even the short-term
implications of this,

3141
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:18,930
15% of mothers self-reporting
the use of cannabis

3142
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:22,200
at some point during
pregnancy are not yet known.

3143
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:25,740
This is, as we would say, an
experiment that's ongoing.

3144
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:28,590
But I'd be remiss if I
didn't point out these data

3145
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:31,440
and just implore you,
please, please, please,

3146
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,330
if you are pregnant or
considering getting pregnant,

3147
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:35,490
you're a cannabis user, whether
or not you're using edibles,

3148
02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:40,490
if you're a CBD user, please
do whatever is necessary

3149
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:45,150
to not ingest cannabis or smoke cannabis

3150
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:47,790
or ingest CBD during pregnancy.

3151
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:50,130
Now, there may be certain
clinical indications

3152
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:53,340
by which your physician and your OB/GYN,

3153
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:55,560
and the pediatrician that will eventually

3154
02:15:55,560 --> 02:16:00,560
be the pediatrician for your
child will prescribe CBD,

3155
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:02,460
although it's hard to
imagine what those are.

3156
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:07,167
I contacted a number of different
pediatricians and OB/GYNs

3157
02:16:07,167 --> 02:16:10,500
and not a single one said
they would ever suggest,

3158
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:12,990
and in fact would strongly
discourage their patients

3159
02:16:12,990 --> 02:16:16,020
from using cannabis during pregnancy.

3160
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:20,940
But I think that the advent
of edible forms of cannabis,

3161
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:25,830
and the combination of THC
and CBD in certain products,

3162
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:28,800
and the fact that most
people view CBD as safer,

3163
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:32,850
because it does not include,
or does not have, I should say,

3164
02:16:32,850 --> 02:16:35,250
the psychoactive effects that THC does,

3165
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:39,600
has led to a situation where you have 15%

3166
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:41,370
of pregnant mothers using cannabis

3167
02:16:41,370 --> 02:16:43,139
at some point during pregnancy

3168
02:16:43,139 --> 02:16:45,419
and maybe even frequently
throughout pregnancy,

3169
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:47,309
and the effects on the developing fetus

3170
02:16:47,309 --> 02:16:49,079
are completely unknown.

3171
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:54,080
But recall that cannabis
and THC and CBD outcompete,

3172
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:56,910
meaning they park in the receptor

3173
02:16:56,910 --> 02:16:58,650
for endogenous cannabinoids

3174
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:01,200
and prevent endogenous cannabinoids

3175
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,530
from having their normal
level and pattern of action,

3176
02:17:04,530 --> 02:17:06,120
so this is absolutely critical.

3177
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:08,610
I cannot encourage you enough,
or rather, I should say,

3178
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:12,780
I cannot discourage
enough the use of cannabis

3179
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:16,034
and any related compounds in cannabis,

3180
02:17:16,034 --> 02:17:18,360
edible or smoked, certainly not smoked,

3181
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:21,180
but even edible during pregnancy,

3182
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:25,469
and certainly in breastfeeding,
lactating mothers,

3183
02:17:25,469 --> 02:17:26,429
the same is also true.

3184
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:30,030
Recall that cannabis and THC and CBD

3185
02:17:30,030 --> 02:17:31,948
are incredibly lipophilic.

3186
02:17:31,948 --> 02:17:33,809
They're fat soluble,

3187
02:17:33,809 --> 02:17:35,849
and they get into cells very readily,

3188
02:17:35,850 --> 02:17:37,290
and they cross the blood brain barrier.

3189
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:39,750
They cross the blood placental barrier.

3190
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:41,610
So when I encountered this statistic,

3191
02:17:41,610 --> 02:17:43,530
I had to kind of wipe my eyes a few times.

3192
02:17:43,530 --> 02:17:46,860
I could not believe it, and
yet I crosschecked that number

3193
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:47,969
with a few other studies.

3194
02:17:47,969 --> 02:17:49,769
A few others have come
in a little bit lower

3195
02:17:49,770 --> 02:17:51,746
at somewhere like 13% to 14%,

3196
02:17:51,746 --> 02:17:53,339
and a few have come in
a little bit higher,

3197
02:17:53,340 --> 02:17:57,420
but the average of 15% is
both striking and shocking,

3198
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:59,400
so I don't know how to make
the message more clear.

3199
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:00,600
I hope that is clear.

3200
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:04,778
Please do not use any cannabis, THC

3201
02:18:04,778 --> 02:18:09,360
or related things including
CBD, smoked or edible

3202
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:12,900
if you're pregnant, lactating, et cetera.

3203
02:18:12,900 --> 02:18:15,270
Now we are at the point
where we need to consider

3204
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:17,160
some of the negative
health effects of cannabis

3205
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,590
that have been well documented
in peer-reviewed studies.

3206
02:18:19,590 --> 02:18:20,940
And before I do this,

3207
02:18:20,940 --> 02:18:22,680
I want to return to a
point that I made earlier,

3208
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:25,410
which is that nothing I am about to say

3209
02:18:25,410 --> 02:18:28,139
relates directly to issues of legality.

3210
02:18:28,139 --> 02:18:30,479
If we consider alcohol, for instance,

3211
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:32,940
alcohol is legal in
most areas of the world.

3212
02:18:32,940 --> 02:18:34,830
It's certainly legal in the US,

3213
02:18:34,830 --> 02:18:37,980
and yet there's an age limit for its use.

3214
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:39,959
Typically, it's not available to people

3215
02:18:39,959 --> 02:18:41,699
until they're 21 or older.

3216
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:43,260
It's not to say that
certain people don't use it

3217
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:46,980
before age 21, but it's not legal.

3218
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:50,129
It is illegal to buy or possess alcohol,

3219
02:18:50,129 --> 02:18:53,459
consume alcohol before age 21,
and I think with good reason,

3220
02:18:53,459 --> 02:18:56,009
because the brain is still developing.

3221
02:18:56,010 --> 02:19:01,010
Likewise, we can have a informed
discussion about cannabis

3222
02:19:01,264 --> 02:19:03,178
and its various components

3223
02:19:03,179 --> 02:19:06,750
that can fully acknowledge the reality,

3224
02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:11,700
which is that one of the major
harms of cannabis in the past

3225
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:15,498
has been the legal ramifications
of cannabis being illegal.

3226
02:19:15,498 --> 02:19:19,020
That's a statement that is
no longer controversial,

3227
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:20,309
and this is not a discussion

3228
02:19:20,309 --> 02:19:22,319
about legalization or non legalization.

3229
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:24,270
If you look to the scientific literature,

3230
02:19:24,270 --> 02:19:26,730
the epidemiological literature,

3231
02:19:26,730 --> 02:19:29,340
there are wonderful data
out of Carleton University

3232
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:32,022
and elsewhere in Canada showing that

3233
02:19:32,022 --> 02:19:37,022
many of the negative
effects of marijuana and THC

3234
02:19:37,799 --> 02:19:41,129
are due to the criminal
justice system, itself,

3235
02:19:41,129 --> 02:19:45,629
that is the creation of
illicit drug businesses,

3236
02:19:45,629 --> 02:19:47,819
the creation of organized crime,

3237
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:50,250
the creation of a number
of different features

3238
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:54,240
related to the illegality of cannabis.

3239
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:57,330
And again, this isn't the
topic of today's episode,

3240
02:19:57,330 --> 02:19:59,250
but that should be acknowledged.

3241
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:01,350
And at the same time,
we need to acknowledge

3242
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:05,700
that when a compound, a drug
or whatever you want to call it

3243
02:20:05,700 --> 02:20:09,000
becomes legal, there's
a tendency to assume

3244
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,250
that it's safe and safe for everybody.

3245
02:20:11,250 --> 02:20:15,870
And with respect to cannabis
and THC and perhaps even CBD,

3246
02:20:15,870 --> 02:20:20,820
but certainly for THC and
cannabis that's smoked or vaped

3247
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:24,780
or consumed in edible form,
that is simply not the case.

3248
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:28,470
There are clear data pointing
to negative health effects

3249
02:20:28,470 --> 02:20:31,830
of cannabis use and THC use,
which again, is not to say

3250
02:20:31,830 --> 02:20:33,870
that there are not positive effects

3251
02:20:33,870 --> 02:20:36,060
on mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.

3252
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:37,530
Those are out there and they exist,

3253
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:39,240
and we will mention
some of those of course,

3254
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:40,830
and we've talked about some of those,

3255
02:20:40,830 --> 02:20:42,930
creativity for instance, et cetera.

3256
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:46,320
But if we do not acknowledge
the negative health effects

3257
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:48,330
that are documented in the literature,

3258
02:20:48,330 --> 02:20:51,570
then we are overlooking
some very important data,

3259
02:20:51,570 --> 02:20:54,990
especially as it relates to
the development of psychosis

3260
02:20:54,990 --> 02:20:57,000
in certain individuals.

3261
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:01,230
So, with that said, there
are very strong data,

3262
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:03,300
and I will provide links
to these resources,

3263
02:21:03,300 --> 02:21:04,860
pointing to the fact that for people

3264
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:07,230
who are chronic users of cannabis,

3265
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:09,750
that is using it twice a week or more,

3266
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:13,530
that over time, their levels
of anxiety actually increase,

3267
02:21:13,530 --> 02:21:15,600
and this is true even for individuals

3268
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:17,220
that are using strains of cannabis,

3269
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:21,510
that while under the influence
of cannabis, reduce anxiety.

3270
02:21:21,510 --> 02:21:26,106
Over time, meaning over the
course of 12 or more months,

3271
02:21:26,106 --> 02:21:31,106
there is a well-documented
effect of the anxiety relief

3272
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:35,250
that cannabis and THC initially brought,

3273
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:36,870
being less and less potent.

3274
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:41,340
That is people need to smoke
more of it or ingest more THC

3275
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:44,460
in order to achieve the same
level of anxiety relief,

3276
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:48,030
and in some cases, a
switch from anxiety relief

3277
02:21:48,030 --> 02:21:50,130
to increase in anxiety,

3278
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:52,440
and again, that's increase in anxiety,

3279
02:21:52,440 --> 02:21:55,920
not just when the drug
is not being consumed,

3280
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:58,650
but also while under the
influence of the drug.

3281
02:21:58,650 --> 02:21:59,940
Why would that be?

3282
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:03,960
We have to go back to our
understanding of the CB1 receptor

3283
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:08,253
and the potency with which THC
binds to that CB1 receptor.

3284
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:12,693
When THC is brought into the
system over and over again,

3285
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:16,020
meaning twice a week or more,

3286
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:19,350
the binding of THC, that CB1 receptor,

3287
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:23,520
eventually causes a
habituation or attenuation

3288
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:26,790
of the entire process
of binding the receptor

3289
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:28,710
and creating the psychoactive effects.

3290
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:30,780
So initially it creates anxiety relief,

3291
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:35,130
but over time, the affinity for
the receptor doesn't change,

3292
02:22:35,130 --> 02:22:36,630
meaning it can still park in that slot

3293
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:39,390
with a lot of affinity, a lot of strength,

3294
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:43,140
but there are fewer receptors available,

3295
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:46,560
and then the signaling that's
downstream of those receptors

3296
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,750
becomes less and less robust.

3297
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:50,850
Now this is a topic we didn't get into

3298
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:53,580
in too much detail today,
because I didn't want to include

3299
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,910
even more biological
detail, but the CB1 receptor

3300
02:22:56,910 --> 02:22:59,842
is a so-called G protein-coupled receptor.

3301
02:22:59,842 --> 02:23:02,700
That's a mouthful, but a
G protein-coupled receptor

3302
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:04,830
basically is like a bucket brigade.

3303
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:06,660
So while some receptors
in the brain and body

3304
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:09,990
are such that when something,
a chemical binds to them,

3305
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:11,700
that receptor has a direct action,

3306
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:14,100
like it opens and allows
stuff to rush into the cell,

3307
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:16,320
increases the excitability of the cell,

3308
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:18,060
so called fast effects,

3309
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:20,400
these G protein-coupled receptors,

3310
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:23,610
and CB1 is a G protein-coupled receptor,

3311
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:25,050
they are more like a bucket brigade

3312
02:23:25,050 --> 02:23:28,350
where they kick off a
process through one molecule

3313
02:23:28,350 --> 02:23:30,780
that then is handed
off to another molecule

3314
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:32,880
that then is handed off
to another molecule.

3315
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:36,210
It's a long chain or cascade of events.

3316
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:38,700
Those long chains or cascades of events

3317
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:42,450
have a lot of opportunity for
regulation, for adjustment.

3318
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:44,130
Receptor systems in the brain and body,

3319
02:23:44,130 --> 02:23:46,440
especially receptor systems
like the cannabinoid system

3320
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:49,620
that are used to being
tickled, not punched,

3321
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,390
tickled by endogenous cannabinoids,

3322
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:53,389
every once in a while
some binds, has an effect,

3323
02:23:53,389 --> 02:23:58,140
but certainly not bound
with incredible potency

3324
02:23:58,140 --> 02:23:59,610
and over and over again as they are

3325
02:23:59,610 --> 02:24:01,560
when THC is coming into the system.

3326
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,180
Well those systems eventually, over time,

3327
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:06,237
they adjust themselves so that the body

3328
02:24:06,237 --> 02:24:09,390
and those cells can achieve
so-called homeostasis.

3329
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:13,770
So when people are using
THC more than twice a week,

3330
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:16,290
what ends up happening is those
G protein-coupled receptors

3331
02:24:16,290 --> 02:24:18,030
in the downstream signaling mechanisms

3332
02:24:18,030 --> 02:24:19,500
start to adjust themselves,

3333
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:23,340
and it requires more and more drug,

3334
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:26,043
so either higher dosages
or more frequent use,

3335
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,430
and a lot of the positive effects,

3336
02:24:29,430 --> 02:24:30,930
the so-called decrease in anxiety,

3337
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:32,700
increased focus, increased creativity,

3338
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:35,220
some of that starts to wane,
it starts to dissipate,

3339
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:37,860
and people wonder why they
have to use so much cannabis

3340
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:40,470
just to achieve a fraction of the effect

3341
02:24:40,470 --> 02:24:44,580
that they used to be able to
achieve with even a lower dose.

3342
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:46,710
So anxiety is getting worse over time,

3343
02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:49,260
and that's anxiety during the drug use

3344
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:51,180
and outside of the drug use.

3345
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:54,990
Some people work around that
or try to work around that

3346
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:57,960
by using varying strains of cannabis

3347
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:01,650
or changing the pattern of
delivery from smoking to vaping

3348
02:25:01,650 --> 02:25:04,770
or from vaping to edible and
from edible to transdermal.

3349
02:25:04,770 --> 02:25:06,750
Anyway, they go through
a lot of gymnastics

3350
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:09,900
and writhing and seeking,

3351
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:12,870
but nonetheless, anxiety
increases over time.

3352
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:17,460
Also, it's very clear that
depression increases over time

3353
02:25:17,460 --> 02:25:19,650
and especially, this is surprising to me,

3354
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:22,770
but especially for individuals
that were not depressed

3355
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:24,300
at the the outset of their use.

3356
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:25,890
In other words, they
didn't start using cannabis

3357
02:25:25,890 --> 02:25:27,510
because they were depressed,

3358
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:30,690
but rather the depression starts to emerge

3359
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:34,350
as a consequence of the
cannabis and THC use.

3360
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:37,800
So that's serious, in fact, we now know,

3361
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:40,260
based on really solid
epidemiological evidence,

3362
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:43,050
that depression is not a strong predictor

3363
02:25:43,050 --> 02:25:45,480
of seeking out cannabis.

3364
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:48,120
It doesn't drive terribly many people

3365
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:50,040
to seek out cannabis use,

3366
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:54,480
but cannabis use, itself, makes
people four times likelier

3367
02:25:54,480 --> 02:25:57,630
to develop a chronic major depression.

3368
02:25:57,630 --> 02:26:01,650
So anxiety is increasing,
depression is increasing,

3369
02:26:01,650 --> 02:26:05,010
and this turns out to
be especially relevant

3370
02:26:05,010 --> 02:26:06,840
and important to young people.

3371
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:07,770
Why do I say that?

3372
02:26:07,770 --> 02:26:09,360
Well, if you look at the data,

3373
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:11,520
and again, I think some
of the strongest data

3374
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,920
are data to come out
of the Canadian system.

3375
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:15,960
They've done some really
beautiful controlled studies.

3376
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:18,420
I really hope to invite some of the people

3377
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:20,700
who arranged and ran those studies

3378
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:22,860
as guests onto the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3379
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:25,590
But if you look at the data out of Canada,

3380
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:26,610
or you look at some of the data

3381
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:28,410
out of Northern Europe and the US,

3382
02:26:28,410 --> 02:26:31,170
what you find is that the probability

3383
02:26:31,170 --> 02:26:33,327
that somebody will use cannabis

3384
02:26:33,327 --> 02:26:36,000
and then go on to use it chronically,

3385
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,770
correlates very strongly with age.

3386
02:26:37,770 --> 02:26:40,860
So for instance, some of the
highest degree of cannabis use

3387
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:44,296
is among individuals 16 to 24 years old.

3388
02:26:44,296 --> 02:26:48,420
In fact, in individuals
who are 16 to 24 years old,

3389
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:52,680
and in particular, in students
and people who are working,

3390
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:56,190
surprising, more than in
unemployed populations,

3391
02:26:56,190 --> 02:26:59,250
being young, 16 to 24, at
least to me that's young,

3392
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:03,720
and being a student or
working doubles the likelihood

3393
02:27:03,720 --> 02:27:06,450
that somebody is going to use
cannabis on a regular basis,

3394
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:08,640
twice or more per week.

3395
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:11,160
The typical age of initiating
cannabis use nowadays

3396
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:14,790
is about 19 years old, so 18.7,

3397
02:27:14,790 --> 02:27:18,420
and about 20% of people
in that age bracket,

3398
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:22,020
of 16 to 24 years old,
are using cannabis daily,

3399
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:24,900
either by vaping, by smoking or by edible.

3400
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:27,180
That's an enormous number,
at least by my read.

3401
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:28,380
It's an enormous number,

3402
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:30,693
and here's why it's of
really serious concern.

3403
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:35,380
During the ages of 16 to 24,

3404
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:38,820
the cannabinoid receptors
are still available.

3405
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:40,800
They are not being as strongly driven

3406
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,660
by endogenous cannabinoids,

3407
02:27:42,660 --> 02:27:47,660
but by ingestion of THC and/or CBD,

3408
02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:49,380
there are downstream effects

3409
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:51,360
on the signaling within those cells

3410
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:56,360
that all the data point
to creating a much,

3411
02:27:56,550 --> 02:28:00,720
much higher likelihood of
developing major depression,

3412
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:04,680
severe anxiety or psychosis at later ages.

3413
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:06,750
So to be very clear, cannabis use,

3414
02:28:06,750 --> 02:28:11,370
between the ages of 16 to
24, in both males and females

3415
02:28:11,370 --> 02:28:14,520
is increasing anxiety,
increasing depression

3416
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:17,490
in the immediate years and
within the one year's time or so,

3417
02:28:17,490 --> 02:28:21,180
so much so that people are
using the cannabis ongoing

3418
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:24,120
in an attempt to reduce that anxiety

3419
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:25,620
and reduce that depression,

3420
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:28,170
but in addition to that, the cannabis use,

3421
02:28:28,170 --> 02:28:31,380
and because of the signaling
mechanisms involved

3422
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:33,870
are predisposing those individuals

3423
02:28:33,870 --> 02:28:35,643
to psychosis later in life.

3424
02:28:36,630 --> 02:28:38,970
If you look at individuals
who start using cannabis,

3425
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:43,710
even younger, age 14,
or even as young as 12,

3426
02:28:43,710 --> 02:28:46,080
the probability of
psychosis later in life,

3427
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:49,710
in particular schizophrenic
or schizophrenic-like episodes

3428
02:28:49,710 --> 02:28:54,270
more than doubles, so this
is of really serious concern,

3429
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:56,520
and this is completely aside

3430
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:58,740
from any so-called positive effects

3431
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:01,350
or beneficial effects of cannabis

3432
02:29:01,350 --> 02:29:04,020
that people might derive from
occasional use as adults,

3433
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,030
meaning people older than 25.

3434
02:29:06,030 --> 02:29:07,770
So for the person who's older than 25,

3435
02:29:07,770 --> 02:29:10,020
who eats an edible every once in a while,

3436
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:12,210
or who smokes cannabis
every once in a while,

3437
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:14,100
and people love to make the argument,

3438
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:15,810
it's not as bad as alcohol,

3439
02:29:15,810 --> 02:29:17,550
which frankly, is a terrible argument,

3440
02:29:17,550 --> 02:29:19,104
because if you saw our episode on alcohol,

3441
02:29:19,104 --> 02:29:20,512
[laughs] alcohol is pretty bad,

3442
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:23,730
but even so, it's just
not a good argument.

3443
02:29:23,730 --> 02:29:25,170
It's saying that something is good,

3444
02:29:25,170 --> 02:29:27,090
because it's not as bad as something else

3445
02:29:27,090 --> 02:29:29,310
is simply just not a
good or valid argument,

3446
02:29:29,310 --> 02:29:31,060
at least not biologically speaking.

3447
02:29:32,194 --> 02:29:35,250
The use of cannabis in young populations

3448
02:29:35,250 --> 02:29:38,700
is very strongly predisposing
people to psychotic episodes,

3449
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:42,720
and we know the mechanism
by which this occurs.

3450
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:46,890
This occurs by a thinning of
the so-called gray matter,

3451
02:29:46,890 --> 02:29:50,310
and it's called gray matter
because with neurons,

3452
02:29:50,310 --> 02:29:52,740
nerve cells, they have
a so-called cell body,

3453
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,690
that's the part that contains the DNA

3454
02:29:54,690 --> 02:29:57,150
and manufacturers all the
neurotransmitters, et cetera.

3455
02:29:57,150 --> 02:30:00,120
And those are shipped out to
the other parts of the neuron

3456
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:02,460
that include the axon,
the wires between axons,

3457
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:05,130
and those axons under the microscope,

3458
02:30:05,130 --> 02:30:07,020
because they have a lot of
fatty tissue around them,

3459
02:30:07,020 --> 02:30:08,310
and this is healthy fatty tissue

3460
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:10,350
that allows electrical
transmission to be fast,

3461
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:12,840
that fatty tissue, those
portions of the cells,

3462
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:13,950
are called white matter,

3463
02:30:13,950 --> 02:30:15,600
so you have gray matter and white matter.

3464
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,400
Gray matter are the so-called cell bodies

3465
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:19,710
where the DNA and all the
stuff is manufactured.

3466
02:30:19,710 --> 02:30:23,334
White matter or the axons or the wires

3467
02:30:23,334 --> 02:30:26,340
through which all the key
components are shipped out

3468
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:27,783
to the synapse, et cetera.

3469
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:31,410
Wonderful data and I do say wonderful,

3470
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:33,780
because it is part of a
large scale consortium,

3471
02:30:33,780 --> 02:30:35,100
and we will provide a link to the paper.

3472
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:37,740
This was published in
"Translational Psychiatry"

3473
02:30:37,740 --> 02:30:40,950
just this year, point to the fact

3474
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:45,240
that adolescent cannabis
use accelerates the thinning

3475
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:47,940
of the prefrontal cortex and
the gray matter in particular.

3476
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:51,600
So what this means is, while
during normal development,

3477
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,880
the gray matter, the prefrontal cortex

3478
02:30:53,880 --> 02:30:56,280
and all the cells there
are indeed intended,

3479
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:58,470
it's a normal process for it to thicken

3480
02:30:58,470 --> 02:31:02,580
and then thin a little bit
as connections are adjusted

3481
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:04,650
and people learn and mature and grow up,

3482
02:31:04,650 --> 02:31:07,230
this is part of the normal
healthy maturation process,

3483
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:09,840
independent of cannabis use.

3484
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:13,860
When kids, 'cause these
really are kids, use cannabis,

3485
02:31:13,860 --> 02:31:15,900
and it doesn't matter the
mode of cannabis delivery,

3486
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:18,390
whether or not it's vaping
or smoking or edible,

3487
02:31:18,390 --> 02:31:21,570
that gray matter thins at
a much, much greater rate.

3488
02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:23,250
And the reason I like this paper published

3489
02:31:23,250 --> 02:31:26,430
in "Translational
Psychiatry" this year so much

3490
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:29,550
is that they link the
amount of cannabis use,

3491
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:32,790
heavy, moderate, light or no cannabis use,

3492
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:35,520
to the rate of prefrontal
cortical thinning,

3493
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:38,520
and it's absolutely clear from these data

3494
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:41,550
that the more often young people,

3495
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:44,760
meaning individuals between
the age of 14 and 25,

3496
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:48,840
the more often they consume
or smoke or vape cannabis,

3497
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:52,290
the faster and the more extreme
that cortical thinning is.

3498
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:53,670
And the cortical thinning is occurring

3499
02:31:53,670 --> 02:31:55,110
in exactly the area of the brain

3500
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:58,950
that's involved in planning,
in control over one's emotions,

3501
02:31:58,950 --> 02:32:03,180
in reflexes, in organizing one's life

3502
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:04,020
in a number of different ways,

3503
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:06,690
anywhere from cleaning
one's room, literally,

3504
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:08,130
knowing what goes where,

3505
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:10,740
to making plans that
extend out through the day,

3506
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:12,180
through the week, through a year,

3507
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:14,070
essentially becoming a
functional human being

3508
02:32:14,070 --> 02:32:16,020
involves using your prefrontal cortex

3509
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:17,550
in a variety of different contexts

3510
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:20,520
and different time domains,
the time domain of an hour,

3511
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:21,870
the time domain of a day.

3512
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:25,050
Making plans and being
able to execute plans

3513
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:27,000
is fundamental to being
a healthy human being,

3514
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,100
and it's absolutely clear from these data

3515
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:32,820
that the more cannabis one uses,

3516
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:35,430
the more impaired those
neural circuits are.

3517
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:38,850
There's simply no other
way to to view these data.

3518
02:32:38,850 --> 02:32:42,480
In fact, so much so, that even
small amounts of cannabis use

3519
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:44,610
are associated with rates
of cortical thinning

3520
02:32:44,610 --> 02:32:47,670
and degrees of cortical thinning
that are really detrimental

3521
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:51,240
and concerning for normal
cognitive processes.

3522
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:54,210
If you were somebody who smoked marijuana

3523
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:57,180
or consumed cannabis
in any form or another

3524
02:32:57,180 --> 02:32:59,820
during adolescence, does that mean

3525
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:02,040
that your prefrontal cortex
can never be rescued,

3526
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,810
that it can't come back?

3527
02:33:03,810 --> 02:33:05,310
Well, the short answer is,

3528
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:07,410
it probably can be rescued to some degree.

3529
02:33:07,410 --> 02:33:10,980
It will depend on how much
cannabis you were using

3530
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:14,940
and how often and what strains
of cannabis, et cetera.

3531
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:16,680
There's really no traveling back in time,

3532
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:18,480
as my graduate advisor used to say.

3533
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,070
Time machines are broken.

3534
02:33:20,070 --> 02:33:21,510
At least for now, we
don't have time machines.

3535
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:24,750
So all you can really
do is try and emphasize,

3536
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:28,049
first of all, quitting
cannabis in any form

3537
02:33:28,049 --> 02:33:33,049
and focusing on behaviors that
emphasize endothelial cell

3538
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:35,730
blood flow health to the brain,

3539
02:33:35,730 --> 02:33:38,760
so that would be cardiovascular exercise,

3540
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:41,520
adequate nutrition, not smoking nicotine,

3541
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,890
and there are a number of
other things that one can do.

3542
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:45,060
We will do an entire episode

3543
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:48,990
all about trying to reverse
the effects of cannabis

3544
02:33:48,990 --> 02:33:50,850
and other drug use during adolescence.

3545
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:52,980
We don't have time to do a
deep dive on that right now,

3546
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:56,039
but all the things that
standardize and promote health,

3547
02:33:56,039 --> 02:33:59,313
adequate sleep, good social connection,

3548
02:33:59,313 --> 02:34:03,510
regular cardiovascular and
weight training exercise,

3549
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:05,850
healthy nutrition, and what
that represents to you,

3550
02:34:05,850 --> 02:34:08,100
healthy metabolic function
and weight, et cetera,

3551
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:11,190
those are all going to
facilitate some recovery

3552
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:13,050
of brain function, in particular,

3553
02:34:13,050 --> 02:34:14,700
prefrontal cortical function,

3554
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:16,140
by way of all the positive effects

3555
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:19,200
that those behaviors and choices have.

3556
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:22,290
But with that said, if
you are in the age bracket

3557
02:34:22,290 --> 02:34:23,310
that I've been referring to,

3558
02:34:23,310 --> 02:34:25,740
this 14 to 25 year old age bracket,

3559
02:34:25,740 --> 02:34:30,630
and you are a occasional even
or chronic cannabis user,

3560
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:34,080
you should be very, very
careful and concerned

3561
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:35,460
about the long-term effects

3562
02:34:35,460 --> 02:34:36,990
that that could potentially have.

3563
02:34:36,990 --> 02:34:39,420
That statement is bolstered
by another statistic,

3564
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:42,843
which is that unlike a lot of other drugs,

3565
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:47,640
the rate of cannabis
use is strongly related

3566
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:52,242
to how dangerous people
perceive cannabis to be.

3567
02:34:52,242 --> 02:34:54,780
Now, that might seem
obvious, on the one hand,

3568
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:57,300
if you think something
is very, very dangerous,

3569
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:58,890
you would expect that the probability

3570
02:34:58,890 --> 02:35:01,050
that somebody would use it
would be very, very low,

3571
02:35:01,050 --> 02:35:02,130
and if they think something is safe,

3572
02:35:02,130 --> 02:35:04,560
the probability would be high.

3573
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:06,660
But that isn't necessarily the case.

3574
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:10,530
If you think about it,
cannabis is a unique instance

3575
02:35:10,530 --> 02:35:12,960
in which nowadays we are hearing,

3576
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,390
yes, it's becoming legal
in a number of areas,

3577
02:35:15,390 --> 02:35:17,640
and we talked earlier about why
that's probably a good thing

3578
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:19,320
in most circumstances,

3579
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:22,380
but that we aren't just
hearing that cannabis is safe,

3580
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:26,010
or it's not just being implied
that cannabis is safer,

3581
02:35:26,010 --> 02:35:28,110
but many more people are talking

3582
02:35:28,110 --> 02:35:30,491
about the positive effects of cannabis

3583
02:35:30,491 --> 02:35:32,400
without a lot of discussion

3584
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:34,380
about the negative effects of cannabis.

3585
02:35:34,380 --> 02:35:35,880
And I realize that saying this

3586
02:35:35,880 --> 02:35:37,380
is going to upset some people out there,

3587
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:38,790
because I know that there
are a number of people

3588
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:41,130
who fought very hard for
the legalization process,

3589
02:35:41,130 --> 02:35:42,930
and I want to acknowledge that.

3590
02:35:42,930 --> 02:35:47,730
I also want to acknowledge the
many known positive effects

3591
02:35:47,730 --> 02:35:52,560
of cannabis in adults
with very occasional use,

3592
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:57,120
provided it is delivered
safely and in the safe context

3593
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:59,580
and setting and with legality.

3594
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:02,040
That is entirely distinct from the issue

3595
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:03,510
of whether or not cannabis is safe

3596
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:05,760
for the developing brain and body.

3597
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:09,211
Again, I'm not demonizing
anybody for using cannabis,

3598
02:36:09,211 --> 02:36:12,780
but I want to make the point
very simply and very directly.

3599
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:17,230
It is far and away a different
circumstance for the brain

3600
02:36:18,270 --> 02:36:21,960
for an individual to be 25 years or older

3601
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:25,260
and using cannabis in whatever form,

3602
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:27,780
occasionally or maybe even frequently,

3603
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:32,780
than it is for a young
person, aged 14 to 25,

3604
02:36:33,090 --> 02:36:36,231
to be using cannabis,
either by smoking or vaping

3605
02:36:36,231 --> 02:36:41,231
or by edible or any other
form, on the brain and body.

3606
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,280
It's absolutely clear that
the brain continues to develop

3607
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:48,000
at least until age 25, and
that a huge number of systems

3608
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,330
related to mood regulation,
so-called executive function,

3609
02:36:51,330 --> 02:36:53,070
the ability to organize one's thoughts,

3610
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:55,530
plan and execute plans,

3611
02:36:55,530 --> 02:36:58,110
essentially to become a
functional human being,

3612
02:36:58,110 --> 02:37:00,540
that's one portion of becoming
a functional human being,

3613
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:02,670
but certainly an essential one.

3614
02:37:02,670 --> 02:37:05,040
All of that relies on the fine tuning

3615
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:06,416
of this neural circuitry

3616
02:37:06,416 --> 02:37:09,720
that we've been talking
about up until now,

3617
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:13,590
and it's abundantly clear that cannabis

3618
02:37:13,590 --> 02:37:18,590
and THC in particular, dramatically
disrupt those processes.

3619
02:37:20,220 --> 02:37:23,970
So if this isn't clear enough,
just from my statements,

3620
02:37:23,970 --> 02:37:26,040
I'd like to point to a particular paper.

3621
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:27,660
This is one of the more impactful papers

3622
02:37:27,660 --> 02:37:29,670
in this area in recent years.

3623
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:33,720
This is a paper published in
"Lancet Psychiatry" in 2022.

3624
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:36,667
Title is "Association of Cannabis Potency

3625
02:37:36,667 --> 02:37:40,390
"with Mental Ill Health and
Addiction, A Systematic Review."

3626
02:37:40,390 --> 02:37:41,970
There are a number of
very important points

3627
02:37:41,970 --> 02:37:43,717
in this very fine paper.

3628
02:37:43,717 --> 02:37:46,260
"Lancet Psychiatry" is one of the premier

3629
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,673
medical journals out there,

3630
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:51,450
and they evaluated a
huge number of studies.

3631
02:37:51,450 --> 02:37:54,450
They actually looked at
more than 4,000 studies.

3632
02:37:54,450 --> 02:37:57,600
They selected the ones that
were only the most rigorous

3633
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:00,480
in terms of study design and analysis

3634
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:05,430
and rigor of conclusions, and
they looked at how early use

3635
02:38:05,430 --> 02:38:09,960
of cannabis impacted later
probability of development

3636
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:12,960
of psychosis and other
psychiatric conditions,

3637
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:16,650
and the takeaways from
this study are very clear.

3638
02:38:16,650 --> 02:38:19,860
First of all, chronic cannabis use,

3639
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:22,410
so more than twice per
week, has consistently

3640
02:38:22,410 --> 02:38:24,390
been associated with
mental health disorders.

3641
02:38:24,390 --> 02:38:26,970
I'm pulling some phrases
directly from the paper.

3642
02:38:26,970 --> 02:38:30,420
Heavy cannabis use, meaning cannabis use

3643
02:38:30,420 --> 02:38:32,836
more frequent than twice per week,

3644
02:38:32,836 --> 02:38:35,760
has been associated
with four times the risk

3645
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:37,890
of psychosis later in life, in particular,

3646
02:38:37,890 --> 02:38:40,740
schizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.

3647
02:38:40,740 --> 02:38:43,119
Now, we've done an episode
on bipolar disorder.

3648
02:38:43,119 --> 02:38:44,700
It's also called bipolar depression.

3649
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:46,260
We have not yet done one on schizophrenia,

3650
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:48,840
but both bipolar disorder
and schizophrenia

3651
02:38:48,840 --> 02:38:51,900
have a very, very strong
genetic component.

3652
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:55,380
There's a 30, three-zero,
30 times greater likelihood

3653
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:56,610
that you'll have bipolar disorder

3654
02:38:56,610 --> 02:38:59,460
if you have a first relative
who has bipolar disorder.

3655
02:38:59,460 --> 02:39:03,030
And then, it's also the
case that using cannabis,

3656
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:05,790
especially during adolescents
and the teen years,

3657
02:39:05,790 --> 02:39:07,470
and up until age 25,

3658
02:39:07,470 --> 02:39:10,469
create a four times
greater risk of psychosis

3659
02:39:10,469 --> 02:39:12,600
for those that have a predisposition

3660
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:15,900
to bipolar disorder and/or schizophrenia.

3661
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:18,720
Now, I don't hear very much
about this in the media.

3662
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:22,830
This paper got some attention
and then it got swept away.

3663
02:39:22,830 --> 02:39:24,480
I don't think that was an
intentional sweeping way.

3664
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:27,810
There's just a lot of events
in the world as you well know.

3665
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:31,200
But I think it's a particularly
important set of findings,

3666
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:34,980
because obviously, in
looking at so many studies,

3667
02:39:34,980 --> 02:39:37,320
it distills out the strongest
findings that are out there

3668
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:40,620
and really pulls the consistent messages

3669
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:42,720
that are arriving from all
these different studies.

3670
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:45,671
And as they point out, and
again, I'm paraphrasing here,

3671
02:39:45,671 --> 02:39:47,610
this is the first systematic review

3672
02:39:47,610 --> 02:39:50,850
of the association of cannabis potency,

3673
02:39:50,850 --> 02:39:53,340
and all of the data point
to a very clear conclusion,

3674
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:58,140
which is the more potent
the THC concentration,

3675
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:00,690
the higher probability
of developing psychosis

3676
02:40:00,690 --> 02:40:02,220
or a major depressive episode

3677
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:04,650
or a major anxiety disorder later in life.

3678
02:40:04,650 --> 02:40:08,850
That should be of particular
concern, because we know,

3679
02:40:08,850 --> 02:40:11,310
we are absolutely clear about the fact

3680
02:40:11,310 --> 02:40:14,760
that with the advent of all
these new strains of cannabis,

3681
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:19,560
and with the engineering
and availability of cannabis

3682
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:24,090
at much higher potency,
meaning THC potency,

3683
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:27,000
the risk of psychosis is going up and up

3684
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,610
and is likely to continue going
up unless something is done

3685
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:34,610
to reduce the frequency of
cannabis use to zero, ideally,

3686
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:39,210
or to very low frequency, very low potency

3687
02:40:39,210 --> 02:40:43,650
in adolescence and teens and
people age 25 or younger.

3688
02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:45,900
I know a lot of people don't
want to hear this message,

3689
02:40:45,900 --> 02:40:47,220
because first of all, it's alarming,

3690
02:40:47,220 --> 02:40:49,830
and second of all, as I mentioned earlier,

3691
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:53,190
the statistics tell us that
the greatest number of people

3692
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:54,540
that are starting to use cannabis

3693
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:57,273
are in the age bracket of 16 to 24.

3694
02:40:58,230 --> 02:41:00,390
Many of them are functional
in other areas of life.

3695
02:41:00,390 --> 02:41:03,780
They're students, they
are employed, et cetera.

3696
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:05,880
But when you couple that with the fact

3697
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:08,580
that the most frequent
adopters of cannabis use

3698
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:11,310
are in this age bracket of 16 to 24,

3699
02:41:11,310 --> 02:41:14,670
they're twice as likely to
use as other individuals

3700
02:41:14,670 --> 02:41:17,520
or to start using cannabis
as are other individuals.

3701
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:19,530
Plus, the general perception out there,

3702
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:21,900
because of the way that
cannabis is discussed

3703
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:24,810
in the media and by sports
figures and by celebrities

3704
02:41:24,810 --> 02:41:27,270
and by politicians, et cetera,

3705
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:30,960
that it's not as bad as
alcohol and maybe not that bad

3706
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:33,630
and maybe even has health benefits,

3707
02:41:33,630 --> 02:41:35,040
then you're essentially
setting up a system

3708
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,080
where young people are far more likely

3709
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:39,178
to adopt and continue cannabis use

3710
02:41:39,178 --> 02:41:42,690
without realizing these
serious health consequences

3711
02:41:42,690 --> 02:41:43,803
that await them later.

3712
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:47,790
With all of that said, I, of course,

3713
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:51,510
again want to acknowledge
that there have been

3714
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:56,510
well-demonstrated effects of
cannabis for reducing pain,

3715
02:41:56,940 --> 02:42:00,180
in particular in chemotherapy
and in the context

3716
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:03,000
of reducing nausea in people suffering

3717
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,830
from cancer or chemotherapy.

3718
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:07,133
There is a well-known effect

3719
02:42:07,133 --> 02:42:10,020
that one can generally
point to as positive,

3720
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:13,440
using cannabis for things like glaucoma,

3721
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:15,720
for lowering intraocular pressure

3722
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:17,220
and offsetting the loss of neurons

3723
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:18,270
that would lead to blindness,

3724
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:19,680
although there are other tools, of course,

3725
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:21,270
that don't involve cannabis use

3726
02:42:21,270 --> 02:42:23,610
that can accomplish that as well,

3727
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:28,470
so called intraocular pressure
lowering drugs or drops.

3728
02:42:28,470 --> 02:42:33,470
There is a list of probably
a dozen or more psychological

3729
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:37,640
and bodily ailments that can
be aided by cannabis use,

3730
02:42:37,640 --> 02:42:41,253
in particular edible cannabis
use of particular strains.

3731
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:44,250
I, of course, am going to address each

3732
02:42:44,250 --> 02:42:47,550
and every one of those in
episodes where I'm talking,

3733
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:51,090
for instance, about eye
disease or about chronic pain.

3734
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:52,860
I am in no way, shape or form

3735
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:56,580
trying to rob the incredible
efforts of the laboratories

3736
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:58,256
and people that have worked very hard

3737
02:42:58,256 --> 02:43:02,730
to study and establish
the valid uses of cannabis

3738
02:43:02,730 --> 02:43:04,350
for treating various ailments

3739
02:43:04,350 --> 02:43:07,200
and that continue to study
cannabis in order to try

3740
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:10,493
and ameliorate the symptoms
of different ailments.

3741
02:43:10,493 --> 02:43:11,910
But today, I really wanted

3742
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:15,000
to emphasize the biology of cannabis,

3743
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:18,240
some of the often discussed effects,

3744
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:19,710
I guess one could call
them positive effects,

3745
02:43:19,710 --> 02:43:20,970
things like enhanced creativity

3746
02:43:20,970 --> 02:43:23,677
and really point to the nuance
and actually the divergence

3747
02:43:23,677 --> 02:43:27,480
of people who take cannabis
and some experience

3748
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:29,550
heightened levels of
creativity and some do not.

3749
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:33,540
Some people experience heightened
levels of sexual arousal

3750
02:43:33,540 --> 02:43:36,420
and some people experience
the exact opposite,

3751
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:37,890
and so on and so forth,

3752
02:43:37,890 --> 02:43:40,680
rather than focus on all
the potential positive

3753
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:44,100
and emerging positive data about cannabis

3754
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:45,780
in different medical contexts.

3755
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:48,510
And at the same time, I strongly
feel that it's important

3756
02:43:48,510 --> 02:43:51,436
to acknowledge the shocking,

3757
02:43:51,436 --> 02:43:54,330
because there's really no
other way to describe it,

3758
02:43:54,330 --> 02:43:58,860
the shocking effects of cannabis
use on the developing fetus

3759
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:01,080
and the fact that so many pregnant

3760
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:03,240
and lactating mothers are using cannabis.

3761
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:07,530
I mean, that number 15% still
has me dizzy with disbelief,

3762
02:44:07,530 --> 02:44:08,850
and yet we need to acknowledge this

3763
02:44:08,850 --> 02:44:11,370
and address this immediately.

3764
02:44:11,370 --> 02:44:15,330
And I think it's vital to
understand that cannabis use

3765
02:44:15,330 --> 02:44:19,020
through any delivery mechanism,

3766
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:22,140
smoking or vaping or edible or otherwise,

3767
02:44:22,140 --> 02:44:24,720
is very, very concerning,

3768
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:26,880
in fact, dangerous to
the developing brain,

3769
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:30,196
certainly for the fetal
brain and for the baby brain,

3770
02:44:30,196 --> 02:44:32,640
but also for the adolescent brain

3771
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:35,610
and for the teen and young adult brain,

3772
02:44:35,610 --> 02:44:36,840
not just because of the effects

3773
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:38,310
that it can have in the immediate term,

3774
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:41,460
those slow creeping increases
in anxiety and depression,

3775
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:43,770
brought on by cannabis use,

3776
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:47,586
but also the time release, if you will,

3777
02:44:47,586 --> 02:44:51,120
on the development of
psychosis and other types

3778
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:54,270
of major psychiatric
disorders later in life.

3779
02:44:54,270 --> 02:44:56,460
I acknowledge we've covered
a lot of ground today,

3780
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:58,230
and yet there's still far more ground

3781
02:44:58,230 --> 02:44:59,160
that we could have covered

3782
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:02,850
and that we will indeed
cover in future episodes.

3783
02:45:02,850 --> 02:45:05,307
Nevertheless, if you are learning from

3784
02:45:05,307 --> 02:45:06,990

Please also check out
the sponsors mentioned

3796
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:30,270
at the beginning of today's episode.

3797

That's the best way to
support this podcast.

3798
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:33,540
As mentioned earlier,

3799
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:35,880
the Huberman Lab Podcast
now has a premium channel.

3800
02:45:35,880 --> 02:45:37,050
You can subscribe to that

3801
02:45:37,050 --> 02:45:39,600
by going to hubermanlab.com/premium.

3802
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:43,830
There, for $10 a month or
$100 for the entire year,

3803
02:45:43,830 --> 02:45:47,100
you can get access to
all of the monthly AMAs,

3804
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:49,110
and you'll be supporting
peer-reviewed research

3805
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:50,760
to develop further protocols

3806
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:53,190
for mental, physical
health and performance.

3807
02:45:53,190 --> 02:45:56,160
Again, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.

3808
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:58,320
Not so much today, but
in many previous episodes

3809
02:45:58,320 --> 02:46:00,720
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we talk about supplements.

3810
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:02,910
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

3811
02:46:02,910 --> 02:46:04,950
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them

3812
02:46:04,950 --> 02:46:06,930
for things like enhancing sleep and focus

3813
02:46:06,930 --> 02:46:08,610
and hormone optimization.

3814
02:46:08,610 --> 02:46:09,630
The Huberman Lab Podcast

3815
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:11,250
has partnered with Momentous supplements.

3816
02:46:11,250 --> 02:46:12,083
If you'd like to see the supplements

3817
02:46:12,083 --> 02:46:13,410
that the Huberman Lab Podcast

3818
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:14,880
has partnered with Momentous on,

3819
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:17,280
you can go to livemomentous,
spelled O-U-S,

3820
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:19,740
so livemomentous.com/huberman,

3821
02:46:19,740 --> 02:46:21,720
and there you'll see a
number of the supplements

3822
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:23,640
that we talk about
regularly on the podcast.

3823
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:25,590
I should just mention that
that catalog of supplements

3824
02:46:25,590 --> 02:46:27,090
is constantly being updated.

3825
02:46:27,090 --> 02:46:28,020
If you haven't already signed up

3826
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:29,220
for the Neural Network Newsletter,

3827
02:46:29,220 --> 02:46:31,980
this is a monthly Huberman
Lab Podcast newsletter

3828
02:46:31,980 --> 02:46:35,040
in which you get some
brief show note summaries

3829
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,950
as well as a lot of actionable
tools in summary form.

3830
02:46:37,950 --> 02:46:39,660
Many people find these very useful

3831
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:42,180
for distilling out the
vast amount of information

3832
02:46:42,180 --> 02:46:43,560
that we cover on the podcast.

3833
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:45,900
So for instance, if you
go to hubermanlab.com,

3834
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:46,960
you can click on the menu,

3835
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:51,060
click to Neural Network
Newsletter or simply newsletter,

3836
02:46:51,060 --> 02:46:53,010
and you can sign up,
just give us your email.

3837
02:46:53,010 --> 02:46:54,900
We do not share your email with anybody.

3838
02:46:54,900 --> 02:46:57,180
And again, it's completely zero-cost.

3839
02:46:57,180 --> 02:46:59,340
We also have examples
of previous newsletters

3840
02:46:59,340 --> 02:47:00,480
that you can download immediately

3841
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:01,890
without having to sign up for anything

3842
02:47:01,890 --> 02:47:03,540
and decide whether or
not you want to sign up.

3843
02:47:03,540 --> 02:47:05,100
Again, that's the Neural
Network Newsletter

3844
02:47:05,100 --> 02:47:06,870
at hubermanlab.com.

3845
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:08,940
If you're not already
following us on social media,

3846
02:47:08,940 --> 02:47:11,370
we are @hubermanlab on
Instagram, on Twitter,

3847
02:47:11,370 --> 02:47:13,170
on Facebook and on LinkedIn.

3848
02:47:13,170 --> 02:47:16,080
And especially on
Instagram and on Twitter,

3849
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:18,330
I cover many of the
tools that are discussed

3850
02:47:18,330 --> 02:47:19,380
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3851
02:47:19,380 --> 02:47:21,210
but also a lot of science
and science-based tools

3852
02:47:21,210 --> 02:47:23,400
not covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3853
02:47:23,400 --> 02:47:25,650
Again, it's @hubermanlab on all platforms.

3854
02:47:25,650 --> 02:47:27,120
So once again, thank you for joining me

3855
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:29,910
for today's discussion all about cannabis.

3856
02:47:29,910 --> 02:47:33,070
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

3857
02:47:33,070 --> 02:47:35,653
