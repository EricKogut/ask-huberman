00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,920
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,700
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,890
and science-based tools for everyday life

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,190
I'm Andrew Huberman.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,410
And I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,350
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,540
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,930
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,090
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,110
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

11
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,470
and science-related tools
to the general public.

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,680
In keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,900
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,567
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

15
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,960
InsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,920
to give you an accurate assessment

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,950
of your health and your biological age.

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,540
There are many things about our health

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,750
that can only be analyzed
from blood and DNA tests.

20
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,420
I've been getting my blood
assessed for many years now.

21
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,490
And about a year ago, I
switched to InsideTracker.

22
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,130
What I like about InsideTracker

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,410
is that you get all this information back

24
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,960
about metabolic factors,
endocrine factors, et cetera,

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,780
that are really important to your health.

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,440
But unlike a lot of blood tests

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,170
where you just get all the
numbers back and it tells you

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,940
whether or not things
are high, normal, or low,

29
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,160
InsideTracker also has this really useful

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,530
and really easy-to-use dashboard

31
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,610
that takes the information
for your blood and DNA tests

32
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,440
and points you toward particular
behavioral, nutritional,

33
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,180
and other sorts of
protocols that you can use

34
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,720
to get the numbers where you
want them for your health.

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,800
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,040
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,350
and they will give you 25%
off any of their programs.

38
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,600
Again, their programs allow
you to assess your health

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,900
from the inside,

40
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,600
things that you could just never assess

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,090
from any kind of test that
didn't involve blood and DNA.

42
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,540
And it also has this
really interesting feature

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,130
that it can measure your inner age,

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,730
which is based on biology.

45
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,420
Your chronological age, of
course, is very informative

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,170
about your health and
where you ought to be

47
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,890
in terms of health
metrics, but people vary.

48
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,890
We know people, of course,

49
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,580
that are in their late
90s who are doing well.

50
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,000
We know people that are in
their 50s who are struggling

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,190
or even in their 20s.

52
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,860
So, blood and DNA are the
way to analyze your health.

53
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,693
That's my belief.

54
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,430
That's why I use InsideTracker.

55
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,220
So, go to insidetracker.com/huberman

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,090
to get 25% off any of their products

57
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,730
and use "Huberman" at checkout.

58
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,010
Our second sponsor of today's
episode is Helix Sleep.

59
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,520
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

60
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,950
that are ideally suited to your needs

61
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,550
for the best night's sleep possible.

62
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,800
I switched to using a Helix
mattress and Helix pillow

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
this last year

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,620
and I'm sleeping better
than I ever have before.

65
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,670
The way that Helix mattresses work

66
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,760
and the reason they're different,

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,340
is that they are tailored to
your individual sleep style.

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,240
Your sleep style can be assessed
by going to their website,

69
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,210
you take a brief two-minute
questionnaire quiz.

70
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,260
Asks you questions like,
do you sleep on your back

71
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,520
or your side or your stomach?

72
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,353
Maybe you don't know

73
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,600
or maybe you move around
a lot during the night.

74
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,540
It also asks you questions
such as do you tend to run hot

75
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,350
or wake up cold, things of that sort.

76
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,020
And then they tailor a particular mattress

77
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,400
to your sleep needs.

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,600
For me, I matched to the
so-called Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress.

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,500
And I love it.

80
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,060
I sleep better than ever.

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,100
And right now, if you
want to try Helix Sleep

82
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,230
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.

83
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,460
And if you do that, you'll
get $200 off your order

84
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,210
plus two free pillows.

85
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,300
They also have a great warranty.

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,700
They have a 10-year warranty
on their mattresses.

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,860
If you don't like the
mattress for any reason,

88
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,644
they'll pick it up for
free from your home.

89
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:31,630
And they just make the whole
thing really easy to try

90
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,240
and determine whether or
not it's right for you.

91
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,040
So again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman
to get $200 off

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,110
and two free pillows on your first order.

93
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,950
Some of you have asked how you
can help support the podcast

94
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,540
in yet other ways, besides
just checking out our sponsors.

95
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,130
We really appreciate the question

96
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,160
and we've set up a Patreon account

97
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,760
at patreon.com/AndrewHuberman

98
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,090
which allows you to donate to the podcast

99
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,920
at a variety of different levels.

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
We have, for instance, the 5-HTP,

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,320
which is in honor of a serotonin.

102
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,750
5-HTP is the name for serotonin

103
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,640
that it allows you to donate $5 per month.

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,620
We have the circadian,

105
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,350
which as many of you, of course,
will know is 24-hour day.

106
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,930
So, you can donate $24
a month if you like.

107
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,829
You can also pick any value that you want.

108
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,810
We even have the Costello,
which is $10 a month

109
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,550
which allows you to support the podcast

110
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,910
in honor of Costello.

111
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,690
The fact that he's 10 years old,

112
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,420
that he eats 10 pounds of food a day,

113
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,930
and the fact that he takes
10 one-hour naps per day

114
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,940
on average.

115
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,150
So again, that's
patreon.com/AndrewHuberman

116
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,450
if you'd like to support
the podcast that way.

117
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,680
Today's episode is going to be all about

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,610
the science of emotions.

119
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,020
The first month of the podcast,

120
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,470
we talked about sleep and wakefulness.

121
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,630
Last month, we were talking
about neuroplasticity,

122
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,770
the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

123
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,990
And this month we're going to talk

124
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,010
about these things that we call emotions.

125
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,960
We're going to decipher what
they are, how they work,

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,550
how we can control them

127
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,783
when we might not want to control them.

128
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,330
There are going to be
four episodes on emotions.

129
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,430
And today, we're going
to talk in particular

130
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,563
about something that most
often is called stress.

131
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:26,150
Now, you might be thinking,
"Wait, stress isn't an emotion."

132
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,690
But stress really lies at
the heart of whether or not

133
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,280
our internal experience
is matched well or not

134
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,690
to our external experience
where the events

135
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,240
that are happening to us and around us.

136
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,260
And as you'll soon, see
those converge or combine

137
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,390
to create what we call emotions.

138
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,780
Now, I want to be very clear

139
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,010
that we're going to talk
about the biology of emotions,

140
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,130
we're going to talk a little bit

141
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,170
about some psychological
concepts related to emotion,

142
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,870
and we are definitely going to talk

143
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,310
about tools to control what we call stress

144
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,840
or commonly think of as stress.

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,610
We're also going to clean up
some common myths about stress.

146
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,550
For instance, that stress
impairs your immune system.

147
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,310
That's true in certain contexts.

148
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,600
And in other contexts,

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,530
stress actually enhances
your immune system

150
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,510
and makes it function better.

151
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,480
There is going to be a lot of discussion

152
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,100
about whether or not our internal state,

153
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,560
whether or not we are alert
or calm is good or bad,

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
depending on the circumstances.

155
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,710
So, where we're headed here

156
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,750
is I'd like you to come
away from today's episode

157
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,670
with what I call an organizational logic,

158
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,490
a framework for thinking
about these things

159
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,740
that typically we just call happy or sad

160
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,418
or depressed or anxious.

161
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:44,500
And I'm going to make
sure that you have tools

162
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,280
that are grounded in
physiology and neuroscience

163
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,190
that will allow you to navigate
this otherwise complex space

164
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,760
that we call emotions

165
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,820
that will allow you to
ground yourself better

166
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,500
when you're feeling like
life is weighing on you,

167
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,590
where you're kind of being
pulled by the currents of life

168
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,800
as well as to support other people

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,044
whether or not that's in
a psychological practice

170
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:11,470
if you're a practitioner, or
you have clients or children

171
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,410
or spouses, really, to be
able to support other people

172
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,470
in your environment better.

173
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,220
And the tools that I'm
going to focus on today

174
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,260
range from behavioral tools.

175
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,040
We will talk about some
of the more valuable

176
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,560
supplementation tools that are out there.

177
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,530
And we're going to talk a little bit

178
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,923
about things like depression, PTSD,

179
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,810
but we will be devoting entire episodes

180
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,610
to things like depression,
PTSD, and even attention deficit

181
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,130
and obsessive compulsive disorder,

182
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,910
which believe it or not,

183
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,120
although this might not
surprise many of you,

184
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,410
have a very strong emotional component.

185
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,650
It's just not just about
compulsive behaviors

186
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,560
and intrusive thoughts.

187
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,270
It's also about the emotional
load of being in that state.

188
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,620
So, I promise that today
we're going to clean up

189
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,820
a lot of misunderstanding.

190
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,160
We're going to give you a lot of tools

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,040
and you're going to learn a lot

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,540
about the biology of how your
body and brain work together.

193
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,910
Because if ever there was a topic

194
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,440
that brought together the brain and body

195
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,070
or mind-body relationship,
it's stress and emotions.

196
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,480
It's also the positive emotions.

197
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,130
When we feel something,

198
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,190
whether or not we're super happy

199
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,010
or just feeling kind of pleasant

200
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,950
or we are feeling stressed,
anxious, and overwhelmed,

201
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,230
it isn't just in our head.

202
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,409
It's also in our body.

203
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,529
And as you may recall, the nervous system,

204
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,440
which includes the brain and
the eyes and the spinal cord,

205
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,750
but also all the connections
with the organs of the body

206
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,530
includes the brain and body.

207
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,010
And those organs of the body,

208
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,930
your gut, and your liver, and your spleen,

209
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,190
they're also communicating with the brain.

210
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,040
So, I look forward to a day, in fact,

211
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,710
when we no longer think about neuroscience

212
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,597
as just the brain.

213
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,120
And many neuroscientists now

214
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,777
also think about the body, of course.

215
00:09:00,777 --> 00:09:02,280
And the brain controls the body,

216
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,240
but the body is also
having a very profound

217
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,150
and concrete influence on the brain.

218
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,610
I think up until recently,
people would hear

219
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,240
about kind of brain-body and
always think about mindfulness.

220
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,090
We're actually not going to talk

221
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,360
that much about mindfulness at all today.

222
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,440
Mindfulness is kind of a
vague concept, in fact.

223
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,860
When you think about mindfulness,

224
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,180
it's good to take the opposite.

225
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,510
What's the opposite of mindfulness?

226
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,590
Would be mindlessness.

227
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,570
Well, all of a sudden we're into territory

228
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,500
that isn't really easy for one person

229
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,030
to describe their experience

230
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,190
or to help others with their experience.

231
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,898
Today, we're going to
talk about objective tools

232
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:40,030
that match the brain-body experience

233
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,790
or separate the brain-body experience

234
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,400
in ways that leverage your
ability to lean into life better,

235
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,990
to feel better, literally
to just feel better

236
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,640
about what you're experiencing,

237
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,210
and believe it or not, to be
able to control your emotions

238
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,380
when that's appropriate.

239
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,260
This isn't about becoming robotic.

240
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,710
This isn't about trying not to feel human.

241
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,000
This is actually about being
able to lean into life better

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,100
as a consequence of being able to control

243
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,170
some of your inner real estate.

244
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,440
This nervous system that
includes the brain and body

245
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,900
and how that nervous system is interacting

246
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
with the outside world.

247
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,550
So, it's to place you in a
greater position of power.

248
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,220
And so, let's get started in
deciphering what is stress,

249
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,210
what are emotions, and why did
I batch stress and emotions

250
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,730
into one discussion today?

251
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,563
Okay.

252
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:28,396
So, what is stress?

253
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,730
We hear all the time that stress is bad.

254
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,090
We hear people saying
they're really stressed out.

255
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,730
What is stress?

256
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,410
You've all presumably heard
the arguments or the framework

257
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,580
that stress is this horrible
ancient carryover over

258
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,410
from times in which humans
were pursued by animals

259
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,125
or other human predators

260
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,830
and that whenever we
feel what we call stress

261
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,220
or feel stressed out,

262
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,560
that it's just this unfortunate
invasion of something

263
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,030
that we no longer need in modern life,

264
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,850
that this was designed for
when we were being attacked

265
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,960
by bears or tigers or
lions or whatever it is.

266
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,470
And gosh, what an unfortunate thing.

267
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,180
And we have so many
creature comforts nowadays,

268
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,830
but we have not eliminated this stress.

269
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,380
Almost as if it was like an
organ or a system in our body

270
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,020
that was bad for us, that we're stuck with

271
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,500
just because of the species that we are.

272
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,080
But first of all, all
species experience stress.

273
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,750
And I think that it's fair to say

274
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,400
even though I wasn't there,

275
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,860
that yes, in fact, throughout
our evolutionary history,

276
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,670
we were vulnerable to animal attack

277
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,000
and other human attacks on a regular basis

278
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,120
up until a point where we
started developing weapons

279
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,830
and structures and fire and other things

280
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,660
that allow us to protect ourselves better

281
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,910
from those animals and
invaders of various kinds.

282
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,370
But it is entirely naive for us to think

283
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,563
that in ancient times,

284
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,080
ancient times being kind of loose term

285
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,210
for previous on medieval times,

286
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,110
100 years ago, 1000 years
ago, 10,000 years ago,

287
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,980
of course, there were infidelities, right?

288
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,740
Partners cheated.

289
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,580
People died.

290
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,870
In fact, before the advent of phones,

291
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,620
which we're going to talk about today,

292
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,600
you can imagine that someone
might head off on a hunt

293
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,780
or to go visit a relative
and never come back

294
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,040
and you would never know why.

295
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,450
That would be very stressful.

296
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,390
So, there was psychosocial stress.

297
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,410
There was the stress of losing loved ones.

298
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,160
There was the stress of cold, of famine.

299
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,160
There was the stress
probably also of just worry.

300
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,610
This idea that ancient versions of humans

301
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,930
1000 years ago, 100
years ago didn't worry,

302
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,540
I think that is entirely inconsistent

303
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,080
with everything we know
about the structure

304
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,240
of the human brain 100
years, 1000 years ago.

305
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,270
So, all the problems that
we're struggling with

306
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,923
existed forever.

307
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:58,090
It's just that stress at its
core is a generalized system.

308
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,180
It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us

309
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,560
or people attacking us.

310
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,790
It's a system to mobilize
other systems in the brain

311
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,860
and body.

312
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,050
That's what stress really is.

313
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,830
It's designed to be generic.

314
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,420
And that's the most important thing

315
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,630
that I'd like you to understand today,

316
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,310
is that the system that
governs what we call stress

317
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,940
is generic.

318
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,363
It wasn't designed for one thing.

319
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,810
And that gives it a certain advantage

320
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,270
in taking over the state
of our brain and body,

321
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,070
but it also gives you, all of us

322
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,280
an advantage in controlling it

323
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,610
because it's based on
hard-wired biological mechanisms

324
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,060
and there are hard-wired
biological mechanisms,

325
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,950
meaning cells and chemicals
and pathways and tissues

326
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,820
that exist in you right now
that require no neuroplasticity

327
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,030
that allow you to put a brake on stress.

328
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,090
And so, we're going to talk about those.

329
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,730
So, you have a system for stress

330
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,780
and you have a system for
distress that are baked into you.

331
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,450
They were genetically encoded.

332
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,880
And you were born with them
and you still have them now.

333
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,960
So, if you're alive and listening,

334
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,570
you have the capacity
to control your stress.

335
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,440
And today, I'm going to talk about ways

336
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,930
that you can control your stress,

337
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,360
not just by doing some
offline practice of meditation

338
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,870
or breath work or something like that,

339
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,630
but real-time tools.

340
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,180
Tools that allow you
to push back on stress

341
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,600
when stress hits in real time.

342
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,970
This is something that
my lab works actively on

343
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,610
in developing and testing these tools

344
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,540
and evolving these tools.

345
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,000
And there are other laboratories
that do this as well.

346
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,150
So, let's talk about the stress response.

347
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,560
And by doing that, you
will understand exactly why

348
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,430
the tools I'm going to give you work.

349
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,797
For those of you that are saying,

350
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,950
"Wait, I just want the tools.

351
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,890
Just give me a summary,"

352
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,960
trust me, if you understand mechanism,

353
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,050
you are going to be in
a far better position

354
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,980
to incorporate these tools, to
teach these tools to others,

355
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,490
and to modify them as your
life circumstances change.

356
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,000
If you'd like the cheat sheet

357
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,870
or you just want the one-page PDF,

358
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,450
eventually we'll get
that stuff out to people,

359
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,450
but it's really important to understand

360
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,410
the underlying mechanism.

361
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,243
Okay.

362
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:05,320
So, what is stress?

363
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,020
Well, let's just distinguish
between stressors,

364
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,680
which are the things that stress us out,

365
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,130
and stress, which is the psychological

366
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,230
and physiological response to stressors.

367
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,690
I'm mainly going to talk about stress,

368
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,290
which is your response to things.

369
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,520
Let's be clear about what we already know,

370
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,570
which is that stressors
can be psychological

371
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,280
or they can be physical.

372
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,113
Okay?

373
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:34,190
If I put you outside on a
cold day without a jacket

374
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,310
for a very long time,

375
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,090
that is stressful.

376
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,720
If I have you prepare for
too many exams at once

377
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,020
and you can't balance it
all with your sleep schedule

378
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,430
and your other needs for
comfort and wellbeing,

379
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,700
like food, rest, sleep,
and social connection,

380
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,723
that is stressful.

381
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,640
So, stress, and as I
mentioned before, is generic.

382
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,200
It doesn't distinguish

383
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,260
between physical and emotional stress.

384
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,400
So, what happens when
the stress response hits?

385
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,100
Let's talk about the immediate

386
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,750
or what we call the acute stress response.

387
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,870
We could also think of
this as short-term stress.

388
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,030
So, you have a collection of neurons.

389
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,000
They have a name.

390
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,050
It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia.

391
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,940
And it has nothing to do with sympathy.

392
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,090
Sympa means together.

393
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,290
And there's a group of neurons

394
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,270
that start right about at your neck

395
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,400
and run down to about your
navel, a little bit lower,

396
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,820
and those are called the
sympathetic chain ganglia.

397
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,490
You don't need to memorize that name.

398
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,960
There will not be a quiz.

399
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,620
But it's important to know that
in the middle of your body,

400
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,120
you have a chain of neurons

401
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,380
that when something stresses us out,

402
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,530
either in our mind

403
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,670
or because something
enters our environment

404
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,270
and we see something that stresses us out,

405
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,480
that we don't like heights
if you're afraid of heights,

406
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,633
somebody you dislike walks
into the room, et cetera,

407
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
that chain of neurons becomes activated

408
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,110
like a bunch of dominoes
falling on all at once.

409
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,783
It's very fast.

410
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,510
When that happens,

411
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,140
those neurons release a
neuromodulator neurochemical

412
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,920
that I've talked about
before on this podcast

413
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
called acetylcholine.

414
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,390
They release that at various
sites within the body.

415
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,319
Now, this is important because normally,

416
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,009
acetylcholine would be
used to move muscles.

417
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,680
Actually, every time we move a muscle,

418
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,509
pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen,

419
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,050
walk down the street,

420
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,230
it's spinal neurons connecting to muscle

421
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,450
and releasing acetylcholine.

422
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,319
So, in the brain it's involved in focus

423
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,290
and it muscles is involved
in making muscles twitch.

424
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,470
But if we were stressed,

425
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,570
we wouldn't want all our
muscles to contract at once

426
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,470
because we would just be kind
of like paralyzed like this

427
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,320
in what tonic activation, as it's called.

428
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,410
We wouldn't want that.

429
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,613
Something called tetanus,
believe it or not.

430
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:43,550
because the tetanus toxin
will cause that kind of rigor

431
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,050
of the entire body.

432
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,100
You do not want that.

433
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,540
When those neurons are activated,
acetylcholine is released,

434
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060
but there are some other neurons

435
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,100
for the aficionados out there.

436
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,130
They're called the postganglionic neurons.

437
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,470
Those ones respond to that acetylcholine

438
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,900
and then they release epinephrine,

439
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,590
which is the equivalent to adrenaline.

440
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,410
So, we have this system
where it's very fast

441
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,610
whenever we're stressed,

442
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,820
the core of our body,

443
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,290
these neurons down the middle of our body

444
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,080
release these chemicals

445
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,300
and then there's adrenaline or epinephrine

446
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,940
released at particular organs
and acts in particular ways.

447
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,230
We're going down into the weeds here.

448
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,730
So just stay with me because
it's going to make a lot of sense

449
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,400
and you will appreciate
having this knowledge in hand.

450
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,283
That epinephrine acts
in two different ways.

451
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,280
Some things like the muscles
of your legs and your heart

452
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,270
and other things that need to be active

453
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,830
when you're stressed,

454
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,450
they have a certain kind of receptor

455
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,570
which is called the beta receptor.

456
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,770
And that beta receptor
responds to epinephrine

457
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,960
and blood vessels dilate.

458
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,020
They get bigger and blood
rushes in to our legs.

459
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,030
The heart rate speeds up.

460
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,350
Lots of things happen that get activated.

461
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,070
And at the same time,

462
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,930
that epinephrine activates other receptors

463
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,780
on certain tissues that we don't need.

464
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,240
The ones involved in
digestion, reproduction,

465
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,130
and things of that sort that are luxuries

466
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,720
for when things are going well,

467
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,370
not things to pay attention
to when we're stressed.

468
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,640
And that binds to other receptors

469
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,840
that contract the blood vessels.

470
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,940
So, basically the stress response,

471
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,070
this is the key phrase here,

472
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,390
the stress response A, is
generic, I said that before,

473
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,390
and B, it basically pushes
certain systems to be activated

474
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,210
and other systems to not be activated.

475
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,370
So, the stress response is two-pronged.

476
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,280
It's a yes for certain things

477
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,200
and it's a no, you may not
right now for other things.

478
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,660
So, that's the key thing to understand

479
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,680
about the stress response.

480
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,030
That's why your heart speeds up.

481
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,910
That's why you feel
blood in certain organs

482
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,130
and tissues of your
body, but not in others.

483
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,090
That's why your throat goes dry

484
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,830
because it turns out that
when you get stressed,

485
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,660
the salivary glands are shut down.

486
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,420
There's a lot less blood flow

487
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,250
to the neurons that control salivation.

488
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,770
And so, you're going to start swallowing.

489
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,620
You feel like your throat is getting dry.

490
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,780
There are a lot of different effects.

491
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,270
I'm not going to list them
all off, but basically,

492
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,290
you are activated in ways
that support you moving.

493
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,190
So, that's the third thing.

494
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,640
It's first of all, it's generic.

495
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,690
Second of all, the stress
response, activate certain things

496
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,760
and shuts down other features of our body.

497
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,330
And then it's a sense of agitation

498
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,890
that makes you want to move.

499
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,160
And that's because fundamentally,

500
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,330
the stress response is
just this generic thing

501
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,650
that says do something.

502
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,050
And movement in this case
can either be the bias

503
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,410
to move in terms of action,

504
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,570
or it can be the bias to say something.

505
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,920
When we are stressed, we are
more likely to say something

506
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,660
that probably we shouldn't say.

507
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,140
We are more likely to move.

508
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,590
And if you're trying to suppress movement,

509
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,620
you'll feel that as a tremor.

510
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,880
You're going to feel agitated

511
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,350
and that's because it
was designed to move you.

512
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,730
So, this is important because
if you want to control stress,

513
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,233
you need to learn how to
work with that agitation.

514
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,390
I'd like to give you a tool at this point,

515
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,080
because I think if we go any further

516
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,230
with a lot more science,

517
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,970
people are going to begin to
wonder if this is just going to be

518
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,600
a kind of standard university lecture

519
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,840
about the stress response.

520
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
I'm going to give you more
signs about the stress response,

521
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,810
but I want to take what
we now already know

522
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,700
about the stress response

523
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,020
and use that as a framework
for thinking about

524
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,370
how one might reduce or even
eliminate the stress response

525
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,140
quickly in real time, should
it arise when we don't want it.

526
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,410
So, we're taking the podium

527
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,920
or we're sitting down at a Zoom call,

528
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,615
and all of a sudden we're feeling flushed.

529
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,680
We're feeling like our heart is racing.

530
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,240
We're feeling a little too alert.

531
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,483
We're feeling a little worked
up and we want to calm down.

532
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,513
As far as I am aware of,

533
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,300
the best tools to reduce stress quickly,

534
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,430
so-called real-time tools
are going to be tools

535
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,630
that have a direct line

536
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,800
to the so-called autonomic nervous system.

537
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,070
The autonomic nervous
system is a name given

538
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,700
to the kind of general
features of alertness

539
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,053
or calmness in the body.

540
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,260
Typically, it means automatic.

541
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,800
Although we do have some control over it

542
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,070
at certain what so-called
leavers are entry points.

543
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,700
Here's what doesn't
work to control stress.

544
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,460
Telling yourself to calm down.

545
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,190
In fact, that tends to
just exacerbate stress.

546
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,510
Telling someone else to calm down

547
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,513
also tends to exacerbate their stress.

548
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,350
If you want to reduce the
magnitude of the stress response,

549
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,570
the best thing you can do is activate

550
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,050
the other system in the body

551
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,730
which is designed for
calming and relaxation.

552
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,520
And that system is called

553
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,770
the parasympathetic nervous system.

554
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,110
Because as I mentioned before,

555
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,450
the neurons that control stress

556
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,730
run from about your neck to your navel.

557
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,580
The parasympathetic neurons,
para just means near,

558
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,720
exist in, they're some
of the cranial nerves.

559
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,460
So, it's kind of left
neck and lower brainstem.

560
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,490
Kind of back of the brain and in the neck

561
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,570
and in the pelvic area.

562
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,650
And the parasympathetic nervous
system is really interesting

563
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,830
because especially the cranial nerves,

564
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,890
the ones that are up in the
brainstem and in the neck area,

565
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,220
those have a direct line to
various features of your face,

566
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,030
in particular, the eyes.

567
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,500
They control things like eye
movements, pupil dilation,

568
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,710
things of that sort,

569
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,840
as well as the tongue, the
facial muscles, et cetera.

570
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
The parasympathetic nervous system,

571
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,890
many people don't realize this,

572
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,430
is the system by which we
control the face and the eyes,

573
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,763
and to some extent, our
airway, the trachea.

574
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,470
And it's these neurons that
reside within the pelvic area.

575
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,160
Now, the neurons within the pelvic area

576
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,240
are involved in control of
the genitals, the bladder,

577
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,490
and the rectum.

578
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,470
And those don't have a direct line.

579
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,770
You don't have a direct
way to control those.

580
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,700
It actually has to go
from brain to spinal cord

581
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,170
and then out to those organs.

582
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,690
Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system

583
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,830
has certain entry points
or what I'll call leavers

584
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,420
that will allow you to push
back on the stress response

585
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,510
in real time and diminish it

586
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,320
and feel more relaxed really quickly.

587
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,550
So, I'm going to teach
you the first tool now,

588
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,870
so I don't overwhelm you with
all this academic knowledge

589
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,970
without giving you something useful.

590
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,970
And the tool that at least to
my knowledge is the fastest

591
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,510
and most thoroughly grounded
in physiology and neuroscience

592
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,430
for calming down in a self-directed way

593
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,280
is what's called the
physiological sigh, S-I-G-H.

594
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,240
Now, some of you might've
heard me talk about this

595
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,270
on previous podcasts,

596
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,960
but I'm going to explain
this in the context

597
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,920
of how respiration in general
is used to calm us down.

598
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,660
And turns out you're all
doing this all the time,

599
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,060
but you are doing it involuntarily.

600
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,220
And when you stress, you tend to forget

601
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,470
that you can also activate
these systems voluntarily.

602
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,030
This is an extremely
powerful set of techniques

603
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,540
that we know from scientific studies

604
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,360
that are being done in my lab,
Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA,

605
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,450
and others now that are very, very useful

606
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,310
for reducing your stress
response in real time.

607
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,520
And here's how they work.

608
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,010
These days, there seems
to be a lot of interest

609
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,210
in breath work.

610
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,170
Breath work typically, is
when you go and you sit down

611
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,460
or you lie down and you
deliberately breathe

612
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,000
in a particular way
for a series of minutes

613
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,670
in order to shift your
physiology, access some states.

614
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,390
And it does have some utility
that we're going to talk about,

615
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,054
that is not what I'm talking about now.

616
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:30,950
What I'm talking about when I
refer to physiological sighs,

617
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,900
is the very real medical
school textbook relationship

618
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,610
between the brain, the body,

619
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,060
and the body as it relates
to the breathing apparati,

620
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,340
meaning the diaphragm
and lungs and the heart.

621
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,630
Let's take the hallmark
of the stress response.

622
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,230
The heart starts beating faster.

623
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,030
Blood is shuttled to the
big muscles of the body

624
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,490
to move you away from
whatever it is the stressor is

625
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,760
or just make you feel like
you need to move or talk.

626
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,070
Your face goes flushed, et cetera.

627
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,290
Heart rate, many of us
feel is involuntary.

628
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,620
Just kind of functions whether
or not we're moving fast

629
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,453
or moving slow.

630
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:09,570
If you think about it, it's
not really purely autonomic

631
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,980
because you can speed up
your heart rate by running

632
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,830
or you can slow it down
by slowing down your run.

633
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,780
You can move to a walk or lie down.

634
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,840
But that's indirect control.

635
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,210
There is however, a way
in which you can breathe

636
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,370
that directly controls your heart rate

637
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,180
through the interactions
between the sympathetic

638
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,630
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

639
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,390
Here's how it works.

640
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,470
When you inhale,

641
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,010
so whether or not it's through the nose

642
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,840
or through the mouth,

643
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,150
this skeletal muscle
that's inside your body

644
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,340
called the diaphragm, it moves down.

645
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,950
And that's because the lungs expand,

646
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,190
the diaphragm moves down.

647
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,050
Your heart actually
gets a little bit bigger

648
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,450
in that expanded space.

649
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,840
There's more space for the heart.

650
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080
So, not your emotional
heart getting bigger.

651
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,980
I'm talking about your
actual physical heart

652
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,890
getting a little bit bigger.

653
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,950
The volume grows.

654
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,940
And as a consequence,
whatever blood is in there

655
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,460
is now at a lower volume or
moving a little bit more slowly

656
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,260
in that larger volume than
it was before you inhaled.

657
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,214
Okay?

658
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,100
So more space, heart gets bigger.

659
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,360
Blood moves more slowly.

660
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,070
And there's a little group of neurons

661
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,070
called the sinoatrial node
in the heart that registers,

662
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,903
believe it or not,

663
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,230
those neurons pay attention

664
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,181
to the rate of blood
flow through the heart

665
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:27,300
and send a signal up to the brain

666
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,670
that blood is moving more
slowly through the heart.

667
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,390
The brain then sends a
signal back to the heart

668
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,230
to speed the heart up.

669
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,240
So, what this means is

670
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,860
if you want your heart to beat faster,

671
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,860
inhale longer, inhale more
vigorously than your exhales.

672
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,600
Now, there are a variety of
ways that one could do that,

673
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,180
but it doesn't matter
if it's through the nose

674
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,013
or through the mouth.

675
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:52,830
If your inhales are
longer than your exhales,

676
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,870
you're speeding up your heart.

677
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,250
If your inhales are more vigorous,

678
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,620
so even if your inhales are
shorter than your exhales,

679
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,970
you are speeding up your heart rate.

680
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,470
Now, the opposite is also true.

681
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,400
If you want to slow your heart rate down,

682
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,010
so stress response hits,

683
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,283
you want to slow your heart rate down,

684
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,820
what you want to do is again,

685
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,600
capitalize on this
relationship between the body,

686
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,800
meaning the diaphragm and
the heart and the brain.

687
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,633
Here's how it works.

688
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:20,480
When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

689
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,780
which makes the heart
a little bit smaller.

690
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,280
It actually gets a little more compact.

691
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,610
Blood flows more quickly
through that compact space

692
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,660
sort of like just a pipe getting smaller.

693
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,270
The sinoatrial node registers

694
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,660
that blood is going more quickly,

695
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,130
sends a signal up to the brain.

696
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,320
And the parasympathetic nervous system,

697
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,980
some neurons in your
brain stem send a signal

698
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,210
back to the heart to slow the heart down.

699
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,730
So, if you want to calm down quickly,

700
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,860
you need to make your exhales longer

701
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,240
and or more vigorous than your inhales.

702
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,280
Now, the reason this is so attractive

703
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,670
as a tool for controlling stress

704
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,440
is that it works in real time.

705
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,720
This doesn't involve a
practice that you have to go

706
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,360
and sit there and do
anything separate from life.

707
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,240
And we are going to get to emotion.

708
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,000
Emotions and stress happen in real time.

709
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,750
And so, while it's wonderful
to have a breath work practice

710
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,040
or to have the opportunity
to get a massage

711
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,340
or sit in a sauna or do
whatever it is that you do

712
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,640
in order to set your stress
controls in the right direction,

713
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,970
having tools that you
can reach to in real time

714
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,410
that require no learning,

715
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,830
I mean, I had to teach it to
you, you had to learn that,

716
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,330
but it doesn't require any plasticy

717
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,700
to activate these pathways.

718
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,240
So, if you're feeling stressed,

719
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,890
you still need to inhale, of course,

720
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,623
but you need to lengthen your exhales.

721
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,200
Now, there's a tool
that capitalizes on this

722
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,010
in a kind of unique
way, a kind of a twist,

723
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,700
which is the physiological sigh.

724
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,230
The physiological sigh was
discovered in the '30s.

725
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,347
It's now been explored at
the neuro-biological level

726
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:52,740
and mechanistically in far more detail

727
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,130
by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA.

728
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,860
Also Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford.

729
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,140
And the physiological sigh
is something that humans

730
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,683
and animals do anytime they
are about to fall asleep.

731
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,110
You also do it throughout
sleep from time to time

732
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,340
when carbon dioxide,

733
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,300
which we'll talk about in a moment,

734
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,310
builds up too much in your system.

735
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,009
And the physiological sigh is something

736
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:17,170
that people naturally start
doing when they've been crying

737
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,220
and they're trying to
recover some air or calm down

738
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,110
when they've been sobbing very hard

739
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,470
or when they are in
claustrophobic environments.

740
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,530
However, the amazing
thing about this thing

741
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,410
that we call the diaphragm,
the skeletal muscle,

742
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,820
is that it's an internal organ

743
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,350
that you can control voluntarily,

744
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,230
unlike your spleen or your
heart or your pancreas

745
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,320
where you can't just say, "Oh,
I want to make my pancreas

746
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,700
turn out a little more insulin right now.

747
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,730
I'm just going to do that
with my mind directly."

748
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,563
You can't do that.

749
00:30:42,563 --> 00:30:44,460
You can do that by smelling
a really good donut

750
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,293
or something,

751
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:46,770
but you can't just do it directly.

752
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,680
You can move your diaphragm
intentionally, right?

753
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,920
You can do it anytime you want.

754
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,050
And it'll run in the background

755
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,970
if you're not thinking about it.

756
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,650
So, this incredible pathway

757
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,200
that goes from brain to diaphragm

758
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,780
through what's called the
phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C.

759
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,613
Phrenic.

760
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:05,930
The phrenic nerve
innervates the diaphragm.

761
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,390
You can control anytime you want.

762
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,830
You can double up your inhales
or triple up your inhales.

763
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,010
You can exhale more than your inhales.

764
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,630
Whatever you want to do.

765
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,850
Such an incredible organ.

766
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,670
And the physiological sigh is something

767
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,760
that we do spontaneously.

768
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,700
But when you're feeling stressed,

769
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,377
you can do a double
inhale, [inhales deeply]

770
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:28,450
[exhales] long exhale.

771
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,940
Now, I just told you a minute ago

772
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,940
that if you inhale more than you exhale,

773
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,630
you're going to speed the heart rate up,

774
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,150
which would promote more
stress and activation.

775
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,440
Now I'm telling you to
do a double inhale-exhale

776
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,090
in order to calm down.

777
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,020
And the reason is the double inhale-exhale

778
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,810
which is the physiological sigh

779
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,010
takes advantage of the fact
that when we do a double inhale,

780
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,810
even if the second inhale is sneaking in

781
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,743
just a tiny bit more air,

782
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,750
because it's kind of hard to get
to deep inhales back to back,

783
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,583
you do big deep inhale

784
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,860
and then another little
ones sneaking it in,

785
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,650
the little sacks in your lungs.

786
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,710
If you only have the lungs.

787
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,110
Your lungs are just two big bags,

788
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,820
but you've got millions of little sacks

789
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,540
throughout the lungs that
actually make the surface area

790
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,680
of your lungs as big as a tennis court.

791
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,130
It's amazing if we were
to just spread out.

792
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,210
Those tend to collapse as we get stressed.

793
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,370
And carbon dioxide builds
up in our bloodstream

794
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,380
and that's one of the reasons
we feel agitated as well.

795
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,810
So, and it makes us very jittery.

796
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,630
I mean, there's some other
effects of carbon dioxide

797
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,750
I don't want to get into,

798
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,010
but when you do the double inhale-exhale,

799
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,750
the double inhale reinflates

800
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,160
those little sacks of the lungs.

801
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,810
And then when you do the long exhale,

802
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,950
that long exhale is
now much more effective

803
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,320
at reading your body and
bloodstream of carbon dioxide,

804
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,600
which relaxes you very quickly.

805
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,160
My lab in collaboration
with David Spiegel's lab,

806
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,130
David's the Associate Chair
of Psychiatry at Stanford,

807
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,580
are doing a study right now

808
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,050
exploring how physiological sighs

809
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,660
and other patterns of
breathing done deliberately

810
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,380
can modulate the stress response

811
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,270
and other things related to emotionality.

812
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,670
Those work are ongoing.

813
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,740
I want to be clear those
studies aren't done.

814
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,230
But it's very clear from work in our labs,

815
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,040
from work in Jack
Feldman's lab and others,

816
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,590
that the physiological sigh
is the fastest, hardwired way

817
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,940
for us to eliminate this
stressful response in our body

818
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,570
quickly in real time.

819
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,330
And so, I'm excited to give you this tool

820
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,380
because I think most people
have heard that mindfulness

821
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,420
and meditation is good,
exercise is good for us,

822
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,600
we all need to be getting
enough sleep, et cetera,

823
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,970
but life happens.

824
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,260
And when you find yourself in a position

825
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,210
where you are more alert and activated

826
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,280
than you would like to be,

827
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,040
regardless of whether or not the stressor

828
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:43,040
is relationship-based or it's
financial or it's physical

829
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,020
or anything like that,

830
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,900
you can look to the physiological sigh

831
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,310
because it bypasses a
very important feature

832
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,143
of how we function,

833
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:53,940
which is that it's very
hard to control the mind

834
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,830
with the mind,

835
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,440
especially when we are in
heightened states of activation.

836
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,770
When you're very alert or very sleepy,

837
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,110
it is very hard to use these
so-called top-down mechanisms

838
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,840
of intention and gratitude
and all these things

839
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,880
that are really powerful
tools when we are not

840
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,340
super activated and
stressed or not super tired.

841
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,840
But when we are anywhere in the range

842
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,610
of very alert and stressed to very sleepy,

843
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,840
physiological sighs are a powerful way

844
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,900
of bringing our level of
so-called autonomic activation,

845
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,139
which just means our
level of alertness down.

846
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,029
And so, whether or not
it's in line at the bank

847
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,480
or whether or not you're
wearing a mask nowadays

848
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,449
or you're not,

849
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:36,209
whatever the conditions
may be where you're at

850
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,350
and your needs,

851
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,350
when you're feeling stressed,

852
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,922
the physiological sigh done
just one to three times,

853
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:43,719
it will be double inhale, exhale,

854
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,089
double inhale, exhale maybe just two times

855
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,850
will bring down your level
of stress very, very fast.

856
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,690
And as far as I know,

857
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,210
it's the fastest way to accomplish that.

858
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:57,320
An important note about
the physiological sigh

859
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,450
or exhale-emphasized breathing

860
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,623
for lowering the stress response.

861
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,600
Many people worry that their heart rate

862
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,653
does not come down fast enough.

863
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,990
I want to tell you you do
not want your heart rate

864
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,610
to reduce very fast.

865
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,250
There's actually something
called the vasovagal response,

866
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,370
where people will stand up

867
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,380
or they'll get up in
the middle of the night

868
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,720
to use the bathroom and
then all of a sudden,

869
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,383
they'll collapse, they'll faint.

870
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,860
That's because the heart
rate was reduced too much.

871
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,140
Some people will see blood

872
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,680
or they'll see something
really troubling and stressful

873
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,840
and they'll pass out.

874
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,420
That's an over-activation

875
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,560
or an acceleration of
the calming response.

876
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,490
They're not so stressed

877
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,180
that they kind of fall
off the cliff of stress.

878
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,420
They get so stressed

879
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,570
that the rebound mechanism
for calming themselves down

880
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,630
goes too high, too fast.

881
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,400
They calmed down too fast
and they collapse and faint.

882
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,190
And so, be aware that if you're going

883
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,700
to use the physiological sigh

884
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,530
or exhale-emphasized
breathing to calm down,

885
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,450
that your heart rate will
take about 20 to 30 seconds

886
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,320
to come down to baseline.

887
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,460
And you may need to repeat
the physiological sigh

888
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,300
a few times.

889
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,170
So, that's an important note
about the use of breathing

890
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,180
to control levels of stress.

891
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,180
The other thing is that when
you decide to look to the body

892
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,560
to control the mind,

893
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,620
it does something else
that's very powerful.

894
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,870
When you are stressed
in your mind and body,

895
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,100
so you're feeling really
agitated, activated, and worried,

896
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,070
and you use a tool like
the physiological sigh

897
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,100
or exhale-emphasized breathing,

898
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,850
you will notice that then
your brain and your mind

899
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,800
becomes more available for
controlling the stress response

900
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,870
and reacting to it.

901
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,660
Which is great because the
sweet spot in life is to be,

902
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,950
provided you're not trying to sleep,

903
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,670
is to be alert and calm.

904
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,503
And so, that's the idea.

905
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,367
Is to be alert and calm

906
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:47,483
and to bring you back into that
sort of plane of alertness.

907
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,460
For those of you that
have trouble sleeping

908
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,500
or just relaxing through the day,

909
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,730
the physiological sigh can be repeated

910
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,400
for 10, 15 cycles if you like.

911
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,970
Some people find that it
actually puts them to sleep.

912
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,880
So, if they lie down and they're reading

913
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,040
and they do too many of these,

914
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,300
that actually can put them to sleep.

915
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,270
And what you'll find is that
most breath work protocols,

916
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,670
the kind of stuff that's
done away from real life,

917
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,010
that you set aside time

918
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,530
and decide to do quote
unquote, breath work,

919
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,550
most of that works such
that if you're doing inhales

920
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,300
that are longer and more
vigorous than exhales,

921
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,050
it tends to be activating and alert you.

922
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,270
If you're doing exhales that are longer

923
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,410
and more vigorous than the inhales,

924
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,410
it tends to put you to sleep.

925
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,600
And many of the protocols
that are out there

926
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,940
from laboratories and
that populate the internet

927
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,610
and wellness sites and whatnot,

928
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,150
if it's exhale-emphasized breathing,

929
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,940
oftentimes has been used as a tool

930
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,030
for trying to teach people to fall asleep.

931
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,500
Physiological sigh is a little different.

932
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,790
It's designed to be used in real time.

933
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,170
Just think of it is just
kind of in your kit of things

934
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,200
that you can do as life happens

935
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,370
and as you need to react to life.

936
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,000
A note about nasal versus mouth breathing,

937
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,260
there's a plethora of
information out there now

938
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,557
because of James Nestor's book,

939
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:57,410
"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"

940
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,620
which came out this last year.

941
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,490
Excellent book.

942
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,250
As well as "Jaws" which is
from Sandra Kahn, Paul Ehrlich

943
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,650
with a foreword by Jared
Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.

944
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,650
So, a collection of people from Stanford.

945
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,010
Jared Diamond is not at
Stanford, but the rest are.

946
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,960
And some heavy hitters on that book,

947
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,610
which is about the benefits
of nasal breathing.

948
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,090
And in many cases, nasal
breathing is more advantageous

949
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,810
than mouth breathing
for all sorts of things.

950
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,100
Cosmetic features of the
face, especially in kids,

951
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,450
warding off infection, et cetera.

952
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,830
With the physiological
sigh, the best way to do it

953
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,760
would be double inhale through the nose,

954
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,680
exhale through the mouth.

955
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,513
But if you can't,

956
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:33,930
and you can only do
that through your mouth,

957
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:34,910
just do it through your mouth.

958
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,350
If want to do all through your
nose, do it through your nose.

959
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,070
This anchors back to
some underlying neurology

960
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,340
or neuroscience.

961
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,760
So, for those of you that want to know,

962
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,100
you have two breathing centers.

963
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,970
One that's involved in rhythmic breathing

964
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,420
for inhales followed by exhales,

965
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,890
followed by inhales followed by exhales.

966
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,460
The so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus

967
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,040
named after a bottle of wine

968
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,070
and discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA

969
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,560
and a nearby nucleus called
the parafacial nucleus

970
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,650
also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.

971
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,930
And the parafacial nucleus is involved

972
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,670
in any time you double up the inhales

973
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,880
or double up the exhales.

974
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,790
It was designed so that you could breathe

975
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,920
while you're speaking

976
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,620
because you can't always
go inhale, exhale,

977
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,170
inhale, exhale when you're speaking.

978
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,040
So, I tell you this, not to
overwhelm you with knowledge,

979
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,320
but just know that when
you double up your inhales

980
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,153
or you double up your exhales,

981
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:22,730
you are activating this
parafacial nucleus.

982
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,070
And it has other cool effects.

983
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,530
Because it's located near the
neurons that control the face,

984
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,780
it also has a tendency to relax the jaw.

985
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,220
There's some interplay between the neurons

986
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,700
that control the speaking stuff

987
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,880
and the stuff for your tongue.

988
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,220
So, all of a sudden, when we
do this physiological sigh,

989
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,780
we tap into neural
circuitry that allows us

990
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,650
to speak more clearly,

991
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,780
to control the muscles
of the face and jaw.

992
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,440
Maybe that means not saying certain things

993
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,960
when we're stressed,

994
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,140
and just generally to relax.

995
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,560
And so, this brings us
back to the neuroscience

996
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,620
of this parasympathetic nervous system.

997
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,000
This calming system that's been
genetically encoded into us

998
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,600
that we all have, regardless
of who our parents are,

999
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,090
which is that the neurons
that control all this stuff,

1000
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,180
the face, the eyes, et cetera,

1001
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,500
are all working together.

1002
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,070
And that's why when we get stressed,

1003
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,977
it's hard for us to speak
or we tend to jitter

1004
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,100
and these kinds of things.

1005
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,030
Just like all the
neurons that cause stress

1006
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,770
in the center of the spinal
cord are working together

1007
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,780
to get our body activated.

1008
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,010
Okay, lot of science today.

1009
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,270
You've now got the
physiological sigh as a tool.

1010
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,830
You know the exhale-emphasized breathing

1011
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,486
will slow your heart down

1012
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:31,320
and inhale-emphasized breathing
will speed your heart up.

1013
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,700
So, let's think about something now.

1014
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,340
Let's think about stress
from not whether or not

1015
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,730
it's acute or chronic,

1016
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,250
whether or not it's good
for us or bad for us,

1017
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,410
but on three different timescales.

1018
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,320
Because then we can arrive
at what this is all about

1019
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,670
as it relates to emotions.

1020
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,300
Because trust me, this has
everything to do with emotions

1021
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,770
and whether or not you're
functioning well emotionally

1022
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,420
or you're not functioning
well emotionally,

1023
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,450
whether or not you're
coping or not coping.

1024
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,600
So, those are typically
psychological terms

1025
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,980
and psychological discussions.

1026
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,640
We are entering this through
the portal of physiology.

1027
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,210
The stuff of medical textbooks.

1028
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,400
And we will arrive at the psychology soon,

1029
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,150
but I really want you to
understand the difference

1030
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,010
between the three kinds of stress

1031
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,480
on three different timescales,

1032
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,010
short-term, medium-term, and long-term,

1033
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,960
and what it's good for
and what it's bad for.

1034
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,220
I think we've all heard
that stress is bad for us.

1035
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,490
We've seen these pictures
intended to frighten us.

1036
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,650
And indeed they are frightening.

1037
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,740
You see the nice really
plump brain on the left.

1038
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,190
It says healthy or control.

1039
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,840
And then you see the
brain that says stressed

1040
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,510
above it on the right
and it's like withered,

1041
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,120
where we see that the hippocampus

1042
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,510
and area involved in memory is smaller.

1043
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,860
People that are stressed.

1044
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,360
We see that the Alzheimer's
brain is made worse by stress.

1045
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,450
That people who have a
predisposition to schizophrenia,

1046
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,283
when they get stressed,

1047
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:52,400
higher incidence of
schizophrenia episodes.

1048
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,600
You hear that addicts will
relapse when they're stressed.

1049
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I mean, okay, we get it.

1050
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,500
And it's very important,

1051
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,010
but I think we've all
heard now so many times

1052
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,510
that stress is bad.

1053
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,220
But in that conversation, unfortunately,

1054
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,000
it's eclipsed some of the
really positive things

1055
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,980
that stress does for us in the short-term.

1056
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,730
So, stress can be short-term,
medium-term, or long-term.

1057
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,740
Long-term stress is indeed bad

1058
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,510
for all the reasons I just
mentioned and many others.

1059
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,000
But what's never actually been discussed

1060
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,910
is what stress is so terrific for,

1061
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,240
positive for in the short-term.

1062
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,010
And I think we tend to overlook
the important question,

1063
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,720
which is what is short-term
and what is long-term?

1064
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,850
No one ever bothers to
tell us what is chronic,

1065
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,930
what is acute.

1066
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,763
Right?

1067
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,596
Is it five minutes?

1068
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,429
Is it five days?

1069
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:39,841
Is it for the duration of final exams?

1070
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:43,847
Or is it for the duration of
a senior thesis in college?

1071
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:46,340
No one actually draws
boundaries around this stuff

1072
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,090
or even general guidelines.

1073
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,020
And so, it's become a
bit of a mess, frankly,

1074
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,530
to try and decipher this
whole space around stress.

1075
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,220
So, I'm going to try and
clean some of this up for you

1076
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,570
based on what we know
from the scientific data.

1077
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,310
First of all, acute stress,

1078
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,780
when the stress response hits,

1079
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,050
that is good for your immune system.

1080
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,790
I know that might be a
tough pill to swallow,

1081
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,900
but it's absolutely true.

1082
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,470
In fact, stress often comes
in the form of bacterial

1083
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,330
or viral infection.

1084
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:21,740
And the stress response
is in part organized

1085
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,710
to combat bacterial and viral infection.

1086
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,760
There are pathways from
the same brain centers

1087
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,990
that activate these
neurons in your spinal cord

1088
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,990
to make you feel like you want to move.

1089
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,063
There are other neurons in your brain

1090
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:37,580
that activate things like your spleen,

1091
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,100
which will deploy killer cells to go out

1092
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,860
and scavenge for incoming
bacteria and viruses

1093
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,560
and try and eat them up and kill them.

1094
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,890
So, short-term stress

1095
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,470
and the release of adrenaline
in particular or epinephrine,

1096
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,330
same thing, adrenaline and epinephrine,

1097
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,980
is good for combating infection.

1098
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,280
And this to me is just
not discussed enough.

1099
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,000
So, that's why I'm discussing it here.

1100
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,860
And it relates to a particular tool

1101
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,970
that many of you ask about,

1102
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,860
but I don't often get the
opportunity to talk about

1103
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,960
in such an appropriate context.

1104
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,980
It's not that it's ever
inappropriate to talk about,

1105
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,800
but what I'm about to talk
about now is the use of,

1106
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,293
again, respiration breathing

1107
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:23,293
to somewhat artificially
activate the stress response.

1108
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,860
And that will accomplish two things.

1109
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,693
Okay?

1110
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:28,040
I'll return to medium
and long-term stress,

1111
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,580
but I want to say
short-term stress is good

1112
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,020
because the dilation of the pupils,

1113
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,660
the changes in the optics of the eyes,

1114
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,200
the quickening of the heart rate,

1115
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,890
the sharpening of your cognition.

1116
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,710
And in fact that short-term stress

1117
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,580
brings certain elements
of the brain online

1118
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,170
that allow you to focus.

1119
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:45,330
Now, it narrows your focus.

1120
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,690
You're not good at seeing
the so-called big picture,

1121
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,010
but it narrows your focus.

1122
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,730
It allows you to do these,

1123
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,230
what I call duration path
outcome types of analysis.

1124
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,780
It allows you to evaluate
your environment,

1125
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,480
evaluate what you need to do.

1126
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,500
It primes your whole system
for better cognition.

1127
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,220
It primes your immune
system to combat infection.

1128
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,840
And that all makes sense when you think

1129
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,563
about that the fact that famine, thirst,

1130
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,690
bacterial infections,
viral infections, invaders,

1131
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,370
all of this stuff liberates
a response in the body

1132
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,280
that's designed to get you to fight back

1133
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,540
against whatever stressor
that happens to be.

1134
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,610
Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral.

1135
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,400
Again, the stress response is generic.

1136
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,370
The tool takes advantage of the fact

1137
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,910
that when adrenaline
is released in the body

1138
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,430
from the adrenals,

1139
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,590
it has the effect of also liberating

1140
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,180
a lot of these killer cells
from the immune organs,

1141
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,480
in particular from the spleen,

1142
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,160
but from elsewhere as well,

1143
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,620
and interactions with the lymphatic system

1144
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,303
that combat infection.

1145
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:53,530
The way this works in the
real world is best captured

1146
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,490
by a study that can be mapped back

1147
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,000
to so-called Wim Hof breathing.

1148
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,220
Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named

1149
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,190
after the so-called "Iceman," Wim Hof.

1150
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,700
Wim Hof, of course, being this Dutch.

1151
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,280
He, I think he has self-titled Daredevil.

1152
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,770
And indeed he has many, many
Guinness Book of World Records

1153
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,000
for things like swimming under icebergs

1154
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,440
and going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts

1155
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,440
and crossing the desert
without water, et cetera.

1156
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,720
Things that are quite dangerous

1157
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,750
if you don't know what you're doing.

1158
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,820
And Wim obviously survived or
I'm telling you he survived.

1159
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,540
But there are two components
to a sort of breathing protocol

1160
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,640
that he developed that was based also

1161
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,230
on what's called Tummo
breathing, T-U-M-M-O.

1162
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,200
So, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing.

1163
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,220
And many people call this now
super oxygenation breathing.

1164
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,440
Although the breath work
aficionados will probably say,

1165
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,970
well, it's not super oxygenation

1166
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,870
because you're also blowing an
awful lot of carbon dioxide.

1167
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,640
What I'm talking about here,

1168
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,320
regardless of whether or not
it's called Wim Hof, Tummo,

1169
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,780
or super oxygenation, is
rapid deliberate breathing.

1170
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,813
So, it's deliberate hyperventilation.

1171
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,950
Why would somebody want to do this?

1172
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,350
Well, deliberate hyperventilation
done for maybe 25 cycles.

1173
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,170
So inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale.

1174
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,610
Typically, it's done in through the nose

1175
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,443
out through the mouth.

1176
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:18,710
Although sometimes it's
just through the mouth.

1177
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,630
If you do that for 15 breaths,
20 breaths, 25 breaths,

1178
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,970
you will feel very alert.

1179
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:27,810
People who have anxiety will feel anxious.

1180
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,360
They might even have an anxiety attack.

1181
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,620
However, we need to ask

1182
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,280
why that kind of breathing feels that way.

1183
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,040
And it's because that
pattern of breathing,

1184
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,740
rapid movements of the diaphragm

1185
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,310
will liberate adrenaline
from the adrenals.

1186
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,470
So, it's the release of adrenaline.

1187
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,780
I mentioned that Wim is
also called "The Iceman."

1188
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,330
Well, that's because
he actually discovered

1189
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,403
this pattern of breathing, somewhat.

1190
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,810
And again, it maps back to Tummo breathing

1191
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,300
by going into cold water.

1192
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,720
When you go into cold water,
that too is a stressor

1193
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,860
and you liberate adrenaline
in response to cold water.

1194
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,060
So, if you get into an
ice bath or a cold shower,

1195
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,033
you will immediately release
adrenaline from your adrenals.

1196
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,670
Now, there are all sorts
of things related to this

1197
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,040
about psychological control

1198
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,180
and stress thresholds
that we'll talk about,

1199
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,720
but I really want people to understand

1200
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,670
that when adrenaline is
released in the body,

1201
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,820
you are in a better position
to combat infections.

1202
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,320
And so, whether or not
you breathe very quickly

1203
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,710
in these cycles of 25 breaths

1204
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,130
and regardless of what you
call it, doesn't matter,

1205
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,310
adrenaline is released.

1206
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,870
If you take a cold shower,
adrenaline is released.

1207
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,650
If you go into an ice bath deliberately,

1208
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:39,690
and even if you do it non-deliberately,

1209
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,860
adrenaline is released.

1210
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,080
You are mimicking the stress response.

1211
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,060
And that adrenaline serves to suppress

1212
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,820
or combat incoming infections.

1213
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,650
And this was beautifully shown in a study

1214
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,700
that was published in a very fine journal,

1215
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,700
the "Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences

1216
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,140
for the US."

1217
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,397
It's literally called

1218
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:00,660
"Proceedings of the
National Academy of USA"

1219
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,590
to distinguish it from other proceedings

1220
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,940
of other national academies
in other countries.

1221
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:11,170
The way the experiment went
is that people were injected

1222
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,410
with endotoxin or in some
cases they were injected

1223
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,290
with a bacterial wall
that mimics infection.

1224
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,290
It gives you a fever.

1225
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,340
It makes you feel nauseous.

1226
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,173
It makes you feel sick.

1227
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,050
It is not pleasant.

1228
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:27,210
Half of the people did a
particular pattern of breathing

1229
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,180
that looked very much like
the pattern of breathing

1230
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:33,180
I described a moment ago
of doing 25 deep inhales

1231
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,270
and exhales followed by an
exhale holding their breath.

1232
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:39,430
Then repeating 25 inhales,
exhales holding their breath.

1233
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:40,680
So, this would look something like this,

1234
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,513
or if you're listening,

1235
00:49:41,513 --> 00:49:42,747
it sounds like [inhaling and exhaling].

1236
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,960
25, 30 times, you'll
start feeling heated up.

1237
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,570
You'll start feeling
the adrenaline response.

1238
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,050
You're liberating adrenaline in your body.

1239
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,680
Then exhale, hold your
breath for 15 seconds

1240
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,760
and then repeat.

1241
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,500
And then typically, after doing three

1242
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,410
or four rounds of that,

1243
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,670
they would inhale very
deeply and hold their breath.

1244
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,380
Now, I want to emphasize
never ever, ever do this

1245
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,770
anywhere near water.

1246
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,620
People have passed out.

1247
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,090
So-called shallow water blackout.

1248
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:07,923
People have died.

1249
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:08,756
Don't do it in the bathtub.

1250
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:09,589
Don't do it the hot tub.

1251
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,670
Don't do it before swimming.

1252
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,040
Please don't do it anywhere near water.

1253
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,140
Please don't do it at all,

1254
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,400
unless you get clearance
to do it from your doctor

1255
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,470
because there are some
pulmonary effects and whatnot.

1256
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,340
And the breath holds should
definitely not be done

1257
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,580
by anyone that has glaucoma
pressure concerns for the eyes.

1258
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,520
But these repeated cycles of breathing

1259
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,320
that liberate adrenaline

1260
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,280
allowed the group that did that protocol

1261
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,660
to essentially experience zero symptoms

1262
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,720
from the ejection of this E.
coli, which is remarkable.

1263
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,760
They had much reduced or no symptoms.

1264
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,050
They didn't feel feverish.

1265
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:41,930
They didn't feel sick.

1266
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,580
They weren't vomiting, no
diarrhea, which is remarkable,

1267
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,280
but makes total sense when
you think about the fact

1268
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,330
that the short-term stress response there,

1269
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,100
what's typically called
the acute stress response,

1270
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,430
it's designed to combat all stressors.

1271
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:58,380
In fact, were you to
cut yourself very deeply

1272
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,400
while out on a hike in the woods,

1273
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,920
the other thing that would happen

1274
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,370
is that there would be a
rapid inflammation response.

1275
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,380
And we always hear inflammation is bad.

1276
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,050
Inflammation gives us Alzheimer's.

1277
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,570
Inflammation is the worst thing.

1278
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,940
But the swelling is associated,

1279
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,720
the inflammation is associated
with the recruitment

1280
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,020
of things like macrophages

1281
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,730
or microglia if it's a neural tissue.

1282
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,760
Cells in our brain and body

1283
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,290
whose job is to act like little ambulances

1284
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,110
and rush to that site and clean it up.

1285
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,580
And indeed the inflammation
response looks horrible,

1286
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,790
it sounds horrible,

1287
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,790
but it's a great thing in the short-term.

1288
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:38,790
You want to have that
tissue marked as in trouble

1289
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,770
and you want the body
and brain to react to it.

1290
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,690
So, if you're getting peaks in stress

1291
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,260
from time to time throughout your day

1292
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,140
or throughout your week,

1293
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,670
you are in a better position
to combat infection.

1294
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,690
You are any better position
to heal your wounds,

1295
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,220
physical wounds.

1296
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,150
Many great things happen
in the stress response.

1297
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,590
Now, of course, the stress response

1298
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,200
isn't always super intense.

1299
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,750
Sometimes it's milder.

1300
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,073
Sometimes it allows us to
just focus on something

1301
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:04,620
because we have a deadline.

1302
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,460
That can feel stressful,

1303
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,030
but that's one of the reasons
you procrastinators out there,

1304
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,800
people are always asking me

1305
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,110
what can be done for procrastination?

1306
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,520
What can be done for procrastination

1307
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,710
is you can understand what's happening,

1308
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,770
which is that you are self-imposing stress

1309
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,780
because stress acts like a drug.

1310
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,630
It is a powerful nootropic.

1311
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,130
I get asked about nootropics.

1312
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:27,480
The most powerful nootropic
or smart drug is stress.

1313
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,310
It's the concern of failure.

1314
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,090
It's the desire to do well.

1315
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,600
It's the impending deadline.

1316
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,760
It's the, "Oh my gosh, I
have to do this thing now

1317
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,593
or I'm going to fail."

1318
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:38,220
That is the best nootropic
you will ever find.

1319
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,910
That combined with a good night's sleep,

1320
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,000
which we'll talk about.

1321
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,210
But we spent a whole month on sleep.

1322
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,370
So, I don't want to backtrack too much.

1323
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,203
Okay.

1324
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,540
So, short-term stress, great.

1325
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,620
The key is to be able to
turn the stress response off

1326
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,050
when you're done, when
you don't want that.

1327
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,360
In fact, let's just really tamp down

1328
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,860
the relationship between the short-term

1329
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,160
or acute stress response and infection.

1330
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,880
Many of us are familiar
with the experience

1331
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,100
of work, work, work, work, work,

1332
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,690
or taking care of a loved one,

1333
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,070
or stress, stress, stress,
stress, then we finally relax.

1334
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,640
Maybe we even go on vacation.

1335
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,360
Like, "Oh, now I'm finally
going to get the break."

1336
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,790
And then we get sick.

1337
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,480
And that's because the
adrenaline response crashed

1338
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,380
and your immune system crashed with it.

1339
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,780
So, please understand this.

1340
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,860
Now, many of you might
say, "Well, how long?

1341
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,810
Is it two hours?

1342
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:24,643
Is it three hours?"

1343
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:26,380
A lot of you out there that
really like specificity,

1344
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,143
it will vary for everybody.

1345
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,810
I would just kind of use a rule of thumb.

1346
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,780
When you are no longer
able to achieve good sleep,

1347
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,350
what good sleep means to you,

1348
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,060
and please see the episodes on sleep

1349
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,430
if you want more about tools to sleep,

1350
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,690
when you are no longer
able to achieve good sleep,

1351
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,330
you are now moving from acute
stress to chronic stress.

1352
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:49,490
You need to be able to turn
the stress response off.

1353
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,950
If I have one wish,

1354
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,490
well, I have many wishes
for this lifetime,

1355
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:56,600
but if I have one wish today
that I hope will permeate

1356
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,020
and spread out there,

1357
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,650
is this idea that we
need from a young age,

1358
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,140
but even as adults and forever,

1359
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,610
we need to learn how to turn
off our stress response.

1360
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,180
Physiological sigh is one.

1361
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,600
If we're going to activate our
stress response intentionally

1362
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,900
by ice baths, cold showers,

1363
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,030
cyclic hyperoxygenated
breathing, aka Tummo breathing

1364
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,400
or Wim Hof breathing,

1365
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,750
we also need to learn
how to press the brake.

1366
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,583
Okay?

1367
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,110
So, let's think about the stress system.

1368
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:25,180
It knows how to activate itself.

1369
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,800
Now we're talking about a way

1370
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,550
of deliberately activating
your stress system

1371
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,830
in order to combat infection.

1372
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:31,960
I do this from time to time.

1373
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,470
I might feel a tickle in my throat

1374
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,620
or like I'm getting kind of run down,

1375
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,570
I will do this kind of breathing.

1376
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:38,403
I do.

1377
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:40,380
I will take 25 or 30 breaths.

1378
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,177
Exhale, hold my breath.

1379
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:44,180
25, 30 breaths again,

1380
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,820
exhale, hold my breath
for about 15 seconds.

1381
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,240
25, 30 breaths again,

1382
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,290
exhale, hold my breath
for 25 or 30 seconds.

1383
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,290
Then a big inhale.

1384
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,350
And I hold my breath until I
feel the impulse to breathe.

1385
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,400
Again, I feel it's safe for me.

1386
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,270
I've run it by my doctor, so it's fine.

1387
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,810
You should not do this
unless it's right for you.

1388
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:01,643
But I do this.

1389
00:55:01,643 --> 00:55:03,560
Some people like the ice bath.

1390
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,360
I rarely do the ice bath.

1391
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,600
Some people like cold showers.

1392
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,100
I like hot showers.

1393
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,210
So, I take hot showers, but
I do this kind of breathing.

1394
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:14,250
Again, they are all having
more or less the same effect

1395
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,090
of increasing adrenaline,

1396
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,410
which allows you to combat the infection

1397
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,430
because you're activating
the immune response.

1398
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:22,520
Okay.

1399
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,490
So, now let's talk about
medium-term stress.

1400
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,600
Medium-term stress is going to be stress

1401
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,360
that lasts anywhere from
several days to several weeks.

1402
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,314
Okay.

1403
00:55:32,314 --> 00:55:33,420
We might think of that
as long-term stress.

1404
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,840
There are times in life when
we are just dealing with a lot.

1405
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,673
Okay?

1406
00:55:37,673 --> 00:55:38,506
This particular quarter,

1407
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:40,930
I happened to be directing
a course, I'm doing the lab,

1408
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,120
I'm doing this.

1409
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,060
I enjoy all these things immensely,

1410
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,670
but I'm kind of near my threshold.

1411
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,490
I'm near the point where
any additional thing,

1412
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,200
like I couldn't log onto
a website the other day

1413
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,110
and it felt like the most
intense thing in the world

1414
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,943
at that moment.

1415
00:55:54,943 --> 00:55:55,940
And I kind of laughed at myself.

1416
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,280
Fortunately, I caught it.

1417
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,120
But that typically wouldn't be my response

1418
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,210
under conditions where I
wasn't pushed to threshold.

1419
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,900
What is this medium-term stress?

1420
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,270
What is stress threshold?

1421
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:09,770
Well, stress threshold
is actually our ability

1422
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:14,060
to cognitive re-regulate
what's going on in our body.

1423
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,960
So, we all hear so much about
we need to unify our mind

1424
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,793
and body.

1425
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,720
We need to be at one with our
mind and body or whatever.

1426
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,450
Now I realize I'm kind of poking fun

1427
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,650
at some of the new agey language,

1428
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,090
but the reason I poke fun

1429
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,540
is not because I don't think it has value,

1430
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,200
but it has no specificity.

1431
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,033
What does that mean?

1432
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:31,970
I mean, I think I'm always in my body.

1433
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:33,920
I've never fortunately
looked across the room

1434
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,370
and seen my arm over there
or my leg over there.

1435
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:38,050
I'm connected to my body.

1436
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:41,080
There actually is a syndrome
where people feel disconnected

1437
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,913
from their limbs.

1438
00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:43,530
This is a real clinical condition.

1439
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,800
These people actually
will seek out amputation.

1440
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,090
They will try and convince doctors

1441
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,260
to amputate certain
portions of their body.

1442
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,763
It's a really terrible
thing for people to have.

1443
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:56,360
And it relates to a change
in central maps in the brain,

1444
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,230
believe it or not.

1445
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,560
Most of us want to keep our limbs,

1446
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,030
whichever ones we happen to have.

1447
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:04,740
And most of us feel one in mind and body

1448
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,240
so much so that when stress hits,

1449
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,980
we feel it in our mind and body.

1450
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,910
A lot of stress inoculation,

1451
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,833
a lot of managing medium-term stress

1452
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:17,680
on the timescale of weeks or
maybe even a couple months,

1453
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,830
so we're not talking
about years of stress,

1454
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,470
a lot of that has to do with
raising our stress threshold.

1455
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,610
It's about capacity.

1456
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,860
And there are very simple
tools, excellent tools

1457
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,230
that will allow us to modulate
our capacity for stress.

1458
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,830
And they look a lot like
the tools I just described.

1459
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,780
They involve placing oneself deliberately

1460
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:44,560
into a situation where our
adrenaline is increased somewhat

1461
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,390
not to the extreme.

1462
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:49,423
And then when we feel
flooded with adrenaline,

1463
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,460
and normally we would panic,

1464
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,240
it's about cognitively,
mentally, emotionally

1465
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,680
calming ourselves and being comfortable

1466
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,530
with that response in our body.

1467
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,190
So, unlike trying to
unify the mind and body

1468
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,470
and make it all calm or make it all alert,

1469
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:09,190
this is about dissociating
mind and body in a healthy way.

1470
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,970
And what would this look like?

1471
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,090
Well, this is something I
actually do as a practice

1472
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,000
because I mentioned before,

1473
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,894
you can use physiological
sighs in real time,

1474
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:21,070
you can use the cyclic
hyperoxygenation breathing

1475
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:24,390
to combat infection if you're
feeling kind of run down.

1476
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,320
And there's also a way

1477
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,340
in which you can use
things like cold showers,

1478
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,840
or if you exercise

1479
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,580
and you bring your
heart rate up very high,

1480
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,750
you kind of go into that
high-intensity realm

1481
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:37,040
where your heart is
beating a little bit harder

1482
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,000
than you're comfortable with
and that you're just you feel,

1483
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,410
some people think it's lactic acid.

1484
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,110
No one can agree on this what the burn is,

1485
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,360
whether or not it's lactic acids

1486
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,210
or it's buildup of hydrogen or whatever.

1487
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,850
I don't want to get into
that, but we're all familiar

1488
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,750
with the intense feeling of
your muscles kind of burning

1489
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:56,200
because you're working
very hard physically.

1490
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,160
The key in those moments is
to learn to relax the mind

1491
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,340
while the body is very activated.

1492
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,280
And what that tends to do,

1493
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,770
there's a limited amount
of research on this,

1494
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,850
but what that tends to do is
it tends to create a situation

1495
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:13,460
where what once felt like
a lot feels manageable.

1496
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,380
Okay?

1497
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,540
That you've raised your stress threshold

1498
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,240
or your stress capacity.

1499
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,760
One way that you can do this,

1500
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,600
and this is kind of fun,

1501
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,980
if it's approved by your physician

1502
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,240
and you're able to do this,

1503
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,640
you can bring your heart rate up.

1504
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,900
You can do this through an
ice bath if that's your thing

1505
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,570
or a cold shower or cyclic
oxygenation breathing

1506
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,400
or you could sprint or you
could go hard on the bike,

1507
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,610
whenever it is that
brings your heart rate up.

1508
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,330
And then what you want to do

1509
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,710
is you want to actually
try and calm the mind

1510
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,540
while your body is in this
heightened state of activation.

1511
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,450
And the best way that
I'm aware to do that,

1512
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,583
again goes back to
physiology, not psychology.

1513
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,140
When we are stressed, our pupils dilate.

1514
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,380
The effect of that pupil dilation

1515
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,800
is to create tunnel vision.

1516
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,970
It literally narrows our
view of the visual world.

1517
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,180
We no longer see in Panorama.

1518
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,640
And there's some other effects as well.

1519
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,100
But that's because the visual system

1520
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,740
through this cranial nerve
system that I described before

1521
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:10,120
is tethered and is part of
this autonomic nervous system.

1522
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,930
By deliberately dilating your gaze,

1523
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,780
meaning not moving your
head and eyes around,

1524
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,080
but by deliberately
going from tunnel vision

1525
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,310
to broader panoramic vision,

1526
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:22,920
literally seeing more of
your environment all at once.

1527
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,680
You don't have to do what I'm
doing, which is not blinking.

1528
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,230
You're welcome to blink.

1529
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,560
But it means deliberately
dilating your gaze

1530
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,820
so that you can see yourself
in the environment you're in.

1531
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,720
It creates a calming effect on the mind

1532
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,310
because it releases a particular
circuit in the brainstem

1533
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,140
that's associated with
alertness, aka stress.

1534
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,930
Now, this is very powerful.

1535
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,700
If you're running, for instance,
and you're at max capacity

1536
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,880
or close to it,

1537
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,060
or you're kind of hitting like
80, 90% of maximum on the bike

1538
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,610
and you dilate your gaze,

1539
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,290
what you'll find is the mind can relax

1540
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:55,410
while the body is in full output.

1541
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,810
And this relates to work
that in various communities,

1542
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,860
people are working with this
in the sports community,

1543
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,430
military community, et cetera.

1544
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,820
But it's a form, not really
of stress inoculation,

1545
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,330
it's more about raising stress threshold

1546
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,860
so that the body is going to continue

1547
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,320
to be in a high alertness,
high reactivity mode,

1548
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,020
high output, but the mind is calm.

1549
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,550
And so, this isn't about
unifying mind and body.

1550
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,230
This is actually about using body

1551
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,070
to bring up your level of activation,

1552
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,630
then dissociating,

1553
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:28,930
not the clinical dissociation
kind of disorders,

1554
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:32,040
but dissociating the mental
or emotional response

1555
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,190
from what's going on in your body.

1556
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,410
And over time, so if you
do this a couple of times,

1557
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,000
you don't have to do this every workout,

1558
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,480
but if you do this every
maybe once a week or so,

1559
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,080
you start being comfortable

1560
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,980
at these higher activation states.

1561
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,920
What once felt overwhelming
and like a lot of work,

1562
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,460
now is manageable.

1563
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,540
It feels tolerable.

1564
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,580
So, that's for navigating
medium-term stress.

1565
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,970
Now, there are other tools as well,

1566
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:56,940
but we don't want to go over 90 minutes

1567
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,770
because 90 minutes is
one old trading cycle.

1568
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,960
I was trying to keep these
podcasts to one on trading cycle,

1569
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,100
in case you haven't noticed,

1570
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,040
so you can derive
maximum benefit from them

1571
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,830
based on all trading and
cycle principles of learning.

1572
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,620
So, I don't want to go into
every little bit of this.

1573
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,020
And I want to make sure
we get to emotions.

1574
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,390
But I want to emphasize that
these medium-term stressors,

1575
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,860
of, "Oh, it's been a hard
month, or hard week."

1576
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,970
Stanford's on the quarter system.

1577
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,270
So 10 weeks or semester.

1578
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:27,450
That becomes more manageable
when we train ourselves

1579
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,860
to be calm of mind when
our body is activated.

1580
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,880
And if you haven't noticed,

1581
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,530
most of the tools I'm describing today

1582
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:38,310
are nothing like the sort of,
okay, sit and do meditation.

1583
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:41,510
I'm actively avoiding
saying the words NSDR,

1584
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,500
non-sleep deep rest.

1585
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,150
I talked a lot about those tools

1586
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:47,130
during the months on
sleep and neuroplasticity.

1587
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,040
And of course, they are wonderful

1588
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,610
for replenishing your
ability to lean into effort,

1589
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,210
to learn to focus.

1590
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:56,150
Please do try and check out NSDR protocol.

1591
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,150
See if they're right for you.

1592
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,020
The margins for safety,
I think are enormous.

1593
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,180
You're basically just
listening to a script.

1594
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,270
We have links to them
in previous captions.

1595
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,810
I've talked on them on
various podcasts before.

1596
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,330
We can provide them again.

1597
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,350
But today I'm really talking about tools,

1598
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,840
so you can learn to dance with stress.

1599
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,450
To in the short-term,
reduce that stress response

1600
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,280
a little bit if you feel
it's too uncomfortable.

1601
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,210
In the medium-term,

1602
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,460
to be comfortable with these
heightened levels of activation

1603
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,637
because life is going to
continue to come at you.

1604
01:03:21,637 --> 01:03:24,300
And we can't pick the stressors,

1605
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,450
but we need to be able to function

1606
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,740
at a higher capacity often.

1607
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,680
And then there's long-term stress.

1608
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,740
Now, long-term stress is bad.

1609
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:35,410
You do not want adrenaline
up in your system

1610
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:36,760
for a very long time.

1611
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,280
In fact, you ideally, you
would have your stress go up

1612
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,950
various times throughout the day,

1613
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,740
but it would never stay elevated

1614
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:45,690
and it would never prevent you

1615
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,940
from getting a good night's sleep.

1616
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,260
Now, that isn't realistic.

1617
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,093
Okay?

1618
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:53,310
I would say for me, three,
four nights out of the month,

1619
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:55,610
no matter what I do, I take on too much

1620
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,820
or something happens in life is life

1621
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,563
and I don't get the best night's sleep

1622
01:03:59,563 --> 01:04:01,260
that I would like to get.

1623
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,890
For many of you, it's 30 nights per month.

1624
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,990
For some of you, it's
zero nights per month.

1625
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:09,210
And congratulations to you
zero nights per month people.

1626
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:11,410
If you are managing your
sleep really well every night,

1627
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,150
that is fantastic.

1628
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,000
You really want to be able
to fall asleep at night,

1629
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,230
stay asleep for most of the night.

1630
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,590
And if you get up, go back to sleep

1631
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,440
for as long as you need to
in order to feel rested.

1632
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,650
That's what I define as a
healthy relationship to sleep.

1633
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,050
Check out the episodes on sleep

1634
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:26,947
if you want tools to be
able to accomplish that.

1635
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,390
And we can all accomplish that.

1636
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,630
It can be done.

1637
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:30,800
And there are tools to do it.

1638
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,240
Zero-cost tools.

1639
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,490
Okay, so let's talk
about long-term stress.

1640
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:38,130
Earlier, I talked about how breathing

1641
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:41,700
can modulate heart rate through this loop

1642
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,537
that includes the brain

1643
01:04:42,537 --> 01:04:44,960
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

1644
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,030
I don't think I mentioned this,

1645
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:47,690
and I want to make sure that I mentioned

1646
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,270
that breathing controlling heart rate

1647
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,890
through the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system

1648
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:57,083
is the basis of what's called
HRV, heart rate variability.

1649
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:01,190
And we know that heart
rate variability is good.

1650
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:04,210
You don't want your heart
rate chronically elevated

1651
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,703
or chronically low.

1652
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:06,536
A lot of people think,

1653
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,020
"Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate."

1654
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,650
And indeed, if you're in shape,

1655
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,250
the stroke volume of your
heart will be greater

1656
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,710
and you can have a nice slow heart rate.

1657
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,680
Years ago when I was running regularly,

1658
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,910
I think my heart rate
was down to like 50 or 60

1659
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,060
or something like that.

1660
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:23,893
That's great.

1661
01:05:23,893 --> 01:05:26,050
But, and now it's higher than that

1662
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,350
because I'm running a little bit less.

1663
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:30,750
But everyone needs to determine
what's right for them.

1664
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,470
But you don't really want your heart rate

1665
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,010
to be chronically low or chronically high.

1666
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:35,843
Both are bad.

1667
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:38,900
We know that chronic
stress, elevated stress

1668
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,570
and especially in the
so-called type A personalities

1669
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,100
creates heart disease,

1670
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,290
the leading killer of for
in most, every country,

1671
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:49,920
but in particular in the US.

1672
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,280
Because of the way that adrenaline

1673
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,957
impacts those blood vessels
or constricting some

1674
01:05:56,065 --> 01:05:57,200
and dilating others,

1675
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,240
it's just that kind of hypertension,

1676
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,260
chronic hypertension is just bad.

1677
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,790
And so, chronic stress truly is bad.

1678
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,630
I want to really make that clear

1679
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,480
because I emphasized a lot

1680
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,490
of what some of the
positive effects of stress.

1681
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,130
But you want to be able

1682
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:14,060
to tamp down your stress in real time.

1683
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,377
You also want to be able
to modulate your stress

1684
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:18,890
and your emotional relationship
to stress in the body

1685
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,220
in the medium-term,

1686
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,420
but by no means do you
want to be stressed out

1687
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,100
all the time, chronically for
months and months and months

1688
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,233
and years on end.

1689
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,500
The best tools, the best mechanisms

1690
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,080
that we know to modulate long-term stress

1691
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,680
might surprise you a little bit.

1692
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,420
First of all, there are
going to be the things

1693
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,253
that don't surprise you,

1694
01:06:40,253 --> 01:06:42,630
which is everyone knows
getting regular exercise,

1695
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:45,850
getting good sleep, using real-time tools

1696
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:48,300
to try and tamp down the
stress response, et cetera,

1697
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,093
that's all going to be really useful.

1698
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:56,090
The data really points to the
fact that social connection

1699
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,320
and certain types of social
connection in particular

1700
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,030
are what are going to mitigate
or reduce long-term stress.

1701
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:06,960
And this is a particularly
important issue nowadays

1702
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,440
where we have all these proxies

1703
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,900
or surrogates for social connection.

1704
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,100
We're online and texting
with people a lot,

1705
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,484
so we can feel connected.

1706
01:07:15,484 --> 01:07:17,210
Like the plane's about to take off

1707
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,200
and everyone's texting each other

1708
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,233
whether or not they have
fear of flying or not.

1709
01:07:20,233 --> 01:07:22,050
They're like, "Okay, see you.

1710
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:22,883
Love you.

1711
01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:23,716
Hate you."

1712
01:07:23,716 --> 01:07:25,953
Whatever it is that they're
trying to communicate to people.

1713
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,567
Then plane lands, every phone's out,

1714
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:30,400
"See you.

1715
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,431
Love you.

1716
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:32,264
Hate you."

1717
01:07:32,264 --> 01:07:33,097
Let's hope it's fewer hate yous.

1718
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:34,420
But everyone has this kind of need

1719
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,760
to stay connected to one another.

1720
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,390
Humans are incredibly social creatures.

1721
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,810
Now, there is a way to look

1722
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,990
at this whole business
of social connection,

1723
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:45,880
not from just the kind of
wishy-washy new agey perspective.

1724
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,530
And I want to point out
that sometimes I'll say

1725
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,130
wishy-washy new agey.

1726
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:51,180
I have nothing against that.

1727
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:55,620
I just, my goal here is
always to put scientific data

1728
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,820
and some neurochemistry on
things so that for those of you

1729
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,960
that are into wishy-washy new agey stuff,

1730
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,480
you also can arm yourself
with some arguments

1731
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,990
for those of the members of
your family and your life

1732
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:10,890
that maybe aren't so tuned
into the typical language

1733
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:13,890
around those practices like,
"Oh, connection is really key.

1734
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,060
We all get oxytocin."

1735
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,060
Actually, did you know that
connection between individuals

1736
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,350
rarely causes the release of oxytocin?

1737
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,430
Oxytocin is released in very
particular circumstances

1738
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:28,430
like post-orgasm, baby
and mother milk let down.

1739
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,710
It's associated with
kind of really intense

1740
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,220
kinds of pair bonding
things of mother and child.

1741
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,310
Also father and child, but
especially mother and child,

1742
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,760
because its relationship
to the lactation system.

1743
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,830
Couples post-sex.

1744
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,520
These kinds of things that reflect deep

1745
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,970
kind of layers of our biology.

1746
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:50,930
And oxytocin is not just
released when we walk in

1747
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,319
and pat the dog on the head

1748
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,926
or we see somebody and
we give them a hug and,

1749
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:56,269
"Hi, great to see you," fist bump.

1750
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,939
That's not a situation for oxytocin.

1751
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:00,569
The way to think about social connection

1752
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,569
and how it can mitigate

1753
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:04,779
some of the long-term effects of stress

1754
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:07,919
is really through the
systems of neuromodulation

1755
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,700
like serotonin,

1756
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,770
and through blocking certain things

1757
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:16,640
that are really bad for us
when we feel socially isolated.

1758
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,850
Things like Taqi Kynan.

1759
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,819
So, let me explain what these are.

1760
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:21,079
Serotonin again, is a neuromodulator.

1761
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,640
Neuromodulators are a little bit

1762
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,870
like playlists in the brain.

1763
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:26,500
They tend to amplify
or bias the likelihood

1764
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,350
that certain brain
circuits and body circuits

1765
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:31,729
are going to be activated
and that others will not.

1766
01:09:31,729 --> 01:09:33,369
Serotonin generally,

1767
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:36,090
and I realize I'm speaking
very generally here,

1768
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:38,170
but it generally gives
us feelings of wellbeing.

1769
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,050
At very high levels,

1770
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,060
it makes us feel blissed
and it tends to make us feel

1771
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,680
like we have enough in
our immediate environment.

1772
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,470
This is why some of the side
effects of antidepressants

1773
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:48,569
that elevate serotonin,

1774
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:49,859
and actually can help a lot of people

1775
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:51,289
with depressive symptoms.

1776
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,250
But the side effects associated with drugs

1777
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:57,750
that increase serotonin
tend to be reduced affect.

1778
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,120
They tend to kind of blunt affect

1779
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,060
or make people feel like
their libido is lower.

1780
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:07,020
Desire goes down because the
body has so much serotonin

1781
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,170
and the brain has so much serotonin,

1782
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,340
that one feels like they have enough.

1783
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,330
But serotonin, pharmacology aside

1784
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:18,150
or taking antidepressants
aside a topic for another time,

1785
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:20,080
serotonin tends to make us feel good.

1786
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,430
When we see somebody that
we recognize and trust,

1787
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,290
serotonin is released in the brain.

1788
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:29,180
And that has certain positive
effects on the immune system

1789
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,900
and on other systems of
neural repair and synopsis

1790
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,500
and things that really reinforce
connections in the brain

1791
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,440
and prevent that long-term
withering of connections.

1792
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,640
So, serotonin is tied
to social connection.

1793
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,660
Now, social connection
can take many forms.

1794
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,620
As many of you know, I am
very attached to my dog.

1795
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,340
I hope he's attached to me.

1796
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:49,430
He's asleep most of the time.

1797
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,263
So, I don't know.

1798
01:10:50,263 --> 01:10:51,350
And even if he was awake,

1799
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,610
I don't really know what I would ask him.

1800
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:56,970
But he seems more or less to
be attached to me as well.

1801
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:00,220
And there's no scientific evidence

1802
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,740
that it has to be human-human attachment.

1803
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:05,020
I do have attachments to humans as well.

1804
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,240
But you can have
attachments to other people.

1805
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,160
Some of those can be romantic attachments.

1806
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,120
They could be familial
attachments that are non-romantic,

1807
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,300
friendship, pets, even
attachments to things

1808
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,800
that just delight us.

1809
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,230
One of the things that really can mitigate

1810
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:23,870
against the long-term negative effects

1811
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:27,660
of chronic long-term stress
isn't just having fun.

1812
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,210
We hear all this stuff, "You
need to play and have fun."

1813
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,840
That can be a little
bit of a tough concept,

1814
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,290
especially for the hard driving people

1815
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,610
or people that are stressed,

1816
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,820
but having a sense of delight,

1817
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,760
a sense of really enjoying
something that you see

1818
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,870
and engage in, witness, or participate in,

1819
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:46,150
that is associated with
the serotonin system.

1820
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:48,010
And certainly, play is
one of those things.

1821
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,520
Social connection of various forms.

1822
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,220
Those are things to invest in.

1823
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,360
Some people might say, "Well,
nobody wants to be my friend,"

1824
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,510
or, "Nobody wants to
engage socially anymore."

1825
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,050
I'll be the first to admit,
social connection and friendship

1826
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,760
and relationships of all
kinds to animals or humans

1827
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,810
or inanimate objects takes work.

1828
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:06,810
It takes investment.

1829
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:10,130
It takes time in not needing everything

1830
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,610
to be exactly the way you want it to be.

1831
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,660
I have a friend who struggles with this

1832
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,680
and oftentimes the
conversations just circle back

1833
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,330
to the fact that when you
want social connection,

1834
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,410
you often have to be more flexible.

1835
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:22,980
You have to eat on other
people's schedules.

1836
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:23,920
Sometimes you have to eat things

1837
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,150
you don't necessarily want to
eat the most in that moment

1838
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:28,500
or stay up a little later
or wake up a little earlier.

1839
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,610
Social connection is
something that we work for,

1840
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:33,100
but it is incredibly powerful.

1841
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,833
I want to, of course, tip my heart to,

1842
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,042
it's only appropriate to call
him the great Robert Sapolsky,

1843
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:43,070
my colleague who I'm
unfortunate to know at Stanford.

1844
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,680
Of course, he has talked
about this quite a lot.

1845
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,490
So, I want to acknowledge
Robert's incredible work

1846
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,970
and discussions around this.

1847
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,680
You can look up those materials online

1848
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,160
and his wonderful books.

1849
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,380
But primates, and we are
primates, we are social species.

1850
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,810
And as Robert has said many times before,

1851
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:02,840
never before in any primate history,

1852
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,260
but in particular in human history

1853
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,340
have we interacted with so
many strangers at a distance

1854
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,710
when we are not really connected to them.

1855
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:14,010
So, finding just a few
people, even one or an animal

1856
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,320
or something that you delight in,

1857
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,530
believe it or not, has
very positive effects

1858
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,370
on mitigating this long-term stress

1859
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:24,680
on improving various aspects of our life

1860
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,943
as it relates to stress and emotionality.

1861
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,500
So, that's the social connection part.

1862
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,880
The other thing is the social
isolation that goes too long

1863
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,260
is associated in everything
from flies, believe it or not,

1864
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:39,570
to mice and humans with
this molecule of Taqi Kynan.

1865
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:44,410
Taqi Kynan is a molecule
that makes us more fearful,

1866
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:48,240
paranoid, and impairs our immune system.

1867
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,900
And so, Taqi Kynan is like this
internal punishment signal.

1868
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,897
It's like our body and
our brain telling us,

1869
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,310
"You're not spending enough time

1870
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,600
with people that you really trust.

1871
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,130
You're not spending time doing things

1872
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,550
that you really enjoy."

1873
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,810
And I often think about
Taqi Kynan for myself

1874
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,040
because I'm pretty hard driving.

1875
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,930
I have a lot of pursuits.

1876
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,750
I also have a lot of wonderful people

1877
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,930
and an incredibly wonderful
bulldog in my life,

1878
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,650
but there are times when
I can be so goal-directed

1879
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,470
and so in motion and trying
to accomplish everything,

1880
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:18,280
that I sometimes forget about Taqi Kynan.

1881
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,740
And I like to remind myself so much so

1882
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,940
that I actually have a
little post-it above my desk

1883
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,560
that says, "Taqi Kynan," to
remind me that Taqi Kynan

1884
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,930
is this very sinister molecule
that starts being secreted

1885
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:31,150
when we are not socially connected enough.

1886
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,550
And this is why long meals
with friends or family

1887
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:35,819
where there are,

1888
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:36,652
we'll talk about phones in a moment,

1889
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:37,820
but where there's no intrusions,

1890
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,840
or even if there are, just
feeling like we are connected

1891
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,050
suppresses Taqi Kynan.

1892
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,940
And Taqi Kynan is something
you really want to avoid

1893
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:50,600
because chronic isolation,
chronically high Taqi Kynan

1894
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,400
that's associated with long-term stress

1895
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,030
really depletes so many good
functions of our brain and body

1896
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:59,330
and promote so many bad
ones including irritability,

1897
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:01,710
paranoia, fear, et cetera.

1898
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:03,450
That is really something to avoid.

1899
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:05,020
And so, I want to highlight Taqi Kynan

1900
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,350
as something to avoid.

1901
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,470
I don't want to completely
disregard oxytocin.

1902
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:12,210
It's just, the oxytocin has
been built up a lot in the media

1903
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,590
and really serotonin works
on much faster timescales.

1904
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,370
Now, how do you know if
you're making serotonin?

1905
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:18,950
And you don't know in the moment,

1906
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:21,060
but you can learn if you pay attention

1907
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,190
to kind of recognize these feelings

1908
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:25,610
of comfort, trust, bliss, delight.

1909
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:28,500
And those are not weak terms.

1910
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,332
Those are not associated just
with psychological terms.

1911
01:15:31,332 --> 01:15:34,760
They are every bit as physiological

1912
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,330
as the movement of your muscles

1913
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:38,090
or the secretion of adrenaline.

1914
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:41,450
And many people focus now on gratitude.

1915
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,330
Gratitude is a little bit subjective.

1916
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,410
And here we're moving from some objective

1917
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,550
to kind of subjective things,

1918
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,630
but recognizing, and in particular,

1919
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:51,530
writing down things that
you're thankful for,

1920
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:53,940
however small, they may seem,

1921
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:57,800
does seem to have a positive
effect on the serotonin system.

1922
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,330
Now, there are a plethora of things

1923
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:00,920
that will also impact wellbeing

1924
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,950
and allow you to modulate
your long-term stress.

1925
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,610
Reduce the likelihood that you'll engage

1926
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:07,890
in long-term stress.

1927
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:09,240
And we don't have time
to go into all these,

1928
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,150
but of course, finding
the diet and nutrition

1929
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:11,983
that's right for you,

1930
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:13,430
the exercise schedule
that's right for you,

1931
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:15,260
the sleep schedule, all that.

1932
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,880
But do not underemphasize

1933
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,170
the social connection part, please.

1934
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:23,240
As well, there are some compounds

1935
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,370
that are not antidepressants.

1936
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:26,990
Although if you need antidepressants,

1937
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:28,600
then a clinician prescribes them to you.

1938
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,300
Please follow their advice if
that's what is right for you.

1939
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,500
There are compounds that are
not prescription compounds

1940
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,340
that can modulate the stress system.

1941
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,650
And sometimes because
of the way that life is,

1942
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:43,790
we just don't have the
opportunity to control life

1943
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,840
and to control our response to stress.

1944
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,260
And at least for myself,

1945
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,960
I can only talk about my own experience,

1946
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,760
I found it useful in
times of chronic stress

1947
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,960
to start modulating some
of the neurochemistry

1948
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,080
related to the stress
response in order to help.

1949
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,750
Now, if a doctor prescribes you prednisone

1950
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,380
or prescribes you some
other hormone or something,

1951
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,213
that's important,

1952
01:17:04,213 --> 01:17:07,530
but what I'm talking about now
are non-prescription things.

1953
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:10,240
You should check out examine.com,

1954
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,160
this free website which will allow you

1955
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,620
to put in any supplement
and evaluate that supplement

1956
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,870
with they provide links in the
so-called human effect matrix

1957
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:18,920
to PubMed.

1958
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,220
It tells you the exact
subjects they were done in.

1959
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,460
It was a post-menopausal women.

1960
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,500
Was it kids?

1961
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,590
Was it normal adults?

1962
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:27,320
Was it people with autism, et cetera.

1963
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,520
Check out that site for
any and all supplements

1964
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,800
you're considering or taking.

1965
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,030
I highly recommend it.

1966
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,730
I've no relationship to them.

1967
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,040
I just think it's a wonderful site

1968
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,490
that's curated all this
important information.

1969
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:41,360
But some of these compounds
are effective enough.

1970
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,290
They can kind of take the edge off.

1971
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:46,070
And I'll use them periodically myself.

1972
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:47,330
And so, I just thought I'd mentioned them

1973
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,770
since there a number of you
that are interested in them.

1974
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,000
The three I want to focus on

1975
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,590
and one that I think you
need to be cautious about

1976
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:54,290
that I've mentioned before,

1977
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:57,780
include ashwagandha, funny name,

1978
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,950
but that's what's it's called,

1979
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:03,350
L-theanine or theanine it's
often called, and melatonin.

1980
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,730
Let's talk about melatonin first.

1981
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:06,910
Melatonin I talked about
during the month on sleep.

1982
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:10,100
Melatonin is a hormone
secreted from the pineal

1983
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,780
in direct relationship to
how much darkness you are in.

1984
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,200
Not emotional darkness.

1985
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,450
But light suppresses melatonin.

1986
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,850
Melatonin helps you fall asleep.

1987
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:19,210
It doesn't help you stay asleep.

1988
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:23,770
I personally do not recommend
supplementing melatonin

1989
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:27,363
because it's supplemented
typically at very high levels.

1990
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,470
One to three milligrams or even more

1991
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:32,680
that is an outrageously high dose.

1992
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,480
It's super, super physiological

1993
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,060
compared to what you normally would make.

1994
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:39,260
It also has a number of
potentially negative effects

1995
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,900
on the reproductive
access and hormones there.

1996
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,450
Some people can take it without problems.

1997
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:46,530
If you like it and
that's your thing, fine.

1998
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:48,510
I just want to cue to the
fact that there can be issues.

1999
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:49,900
You should check on examine.com.

2000
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,810
Talk to your doctor, especially in kids,

2001
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,330
because melatonin suppresses
the puberty response

2002
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,950
in a number of species.

2003
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:57,660
Enough about the negative
things in melatonin

2004
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:01,603
except that people who take
too much melatonin chronically,

2005
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,790
oftentimes when they're taking it to sleep

2006
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:05,940
or for whatever reason,

2007
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,490
yes, it can reduce anxiety and stress,

2008
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,300
but it also can reduce
the output of the adrenals

2009
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,170
to the point where it
can become problematic.

2010
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:16,600
Now, a note about adrenal burnout.

2011
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,380
There is actually no such
thing as adrenal burnout

2012
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,720
under normal conditions.

2013
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,780
The adrenals have enough adrenaline

2014
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:28,110
to support 200 years of
stress for better, for worse.

2015
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,410
The concept of adrenal burnout has origins

2016
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:34,710
in the work of Nobel
Prize winner, Hans Selye,

2017
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,290
who actually discovered

2018
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:38,140
what he called the general
adaptation syndrome.

2019
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,940
He discovered a lot of
things about stress.

2020
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:43,010
He did some phenomenal work
that turned out to be true.

2021
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,720
That we have stressors.

2022
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,090
There's something called distress.

2023
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,760
He talked about eustress,
which is positive stress.

2024
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,666
Eustress has never really caught on

2025
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:52,660
in the kind of more general discussion.

2026
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,340
But he had this theory that
if stress went on long enough,

2027
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:59,560
that you would eventually reach
a phase called exhaustion.

2028
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,473
And that turned out to be wrong.

2029
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,860
Although many of you may feel exhausted

2030
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:05,870
after chronic stress,

2031
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:08,720
there isn't really a physiological
exhaustion that happens.

2032
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,760
And that eventually got picked up

2033
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,650
and ran with the general public.

2034
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:14,160
And they talk about adrenal burnout.

2035
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,730
Too much coffee, adrenal burnout.

2036
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:16,740
You hear all this stuff.

2037
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,260
There is no such thing as adrenal burnout.

2038
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,130
The adrenals don't burn out.

2039
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,190
There is something, however,

2040
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,210
called adrenal insufficiency syndrome,

2041
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:25,600
which is a real physiological problem

2042
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,160
where some people have
very impaired adrenals

2043
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,490
and they can't produce adrenaline.

2044
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,210
And melatonin taken at very high levels

2045
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:34,030
for periods of time that are too long

2046
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,060
can cause suppression of the cortisol

2047
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,660
and epinephrine released from the adrenals

2048
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,900
and can create a kind of pseudo

2049
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,520
adrenal insufficiency syndrome.

2050
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,690
So, be aware of melatonin for that reason.

2051
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:49,250
Please, I'm trying,

2052
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,930
I alone can't get rid of
the phrase adrenal burnout.

2053
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,300
I'm not trying to give a hard time

2054
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,640
to anyone who feels
burnt out or exhausted,

2055
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,180
but it is for other reasons.

2056
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,280
It is not because of the
adrenals are burnt out.

2057
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,720
Unless you happen to have
adrenal insufficiency syndrome.

2058
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,680
So, I'm not a fan of melatonin
for a lot of reasons.

2059
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,513
Now I've mentioned several.

2060
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:08,580
The other is L-theanine.

2061
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,240
I've talked about L-theanine,

2062
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,640
which provided it's safe for you,

2063
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,240
can be taken 100 milligrams
or 200 milligrams

2064
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,250
about 30 minutes or 60
minutes before sleep.

2065
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,170
It can enhance the transition to sleep

2066
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:20,920
and depth of sleep for many people.

2067
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:23,050
It increases GABA,

2068
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,700
this inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the brain.

2069
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,420
It tends to turn off our
forebrain a little bit

2070
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,840
or reduce the activity of
our kind of thinking systems

2071
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,660
and ruminating systems
help people fall asleep.

2072
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,600
That's for sleep.

2073
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,840
But theanine has also been shown

2074
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,290
for people that are chronically anxious

2075
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,950
or chronically stressed to,

2076
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:40,293
if you look at the studies,

2077
01:21:40,293 --> 01:21:41,520
I have a large collection of studies

2078
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,570
in front of me right now,

2079
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:43,920
if you want to see those links,

2080
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,860
I know if you want
those, go to examine.com,

2081
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:46,960
put in theanine.

2082
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,610
They linked, for instance, it is known

2083
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,400
to significantly increase relaxation.

2084
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,840
There are four studies listed
there with PubMed links.

2085
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,180
It is known to have a
minor effect on anxiety,

2086
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,830
but eight studies have shown that.

2087
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,460
Which I think is a fairly
large set of studies.

2088
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,620
Some of them in great journals.

2089
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,950
It also can reduce task
completion anxiety.

2090
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:08,020
So, anxiety related to task completion.

2091
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,740
Not good for the procrastinators perhaps,

2092
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,480
but for those of you that
are chronically stressed.

2093
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,740
It can increase attention a little bit,

2094
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,490
it can reduce blood pressure a little bit,

2095
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:17,070
improve sleep quality, et cetera.

2096
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,040
It definitely has a
notable effect on stress,

2097
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,280
two studies in particular,

2098
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,170
that it can notably reduce
the effects of stress.

2099
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,120
So, there's a lot there.

2100
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,010
It also has effects on insomnia,

2101
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,590
on some blood lipid profiles.

2102
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:32,270
And so, go to examine.com
and check it out.

2103
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:35,290
But this is one reason why I
supplement theanine for sleep.

2104
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,830
But if I'm feeling like I've
been under a lot of stress

2105
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:41,030
and I'm not managing my stress
very well with the short-term

2106
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:43,160
and medium-term tools that
I talked about earlier,

2107
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,900
I might start taking a
little bit of theanine

2108
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,170
especially in the late afternoon,

2109
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,520
which is when I tend to start to feel

2110
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,190
like I haven't gotten enough done

2111
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,050
and the day is kind of carrying on.

2112
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,810
And so, you can blunt the
response to stress a little bit,

2113
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:56,820
which is why a lot of companies

2114
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,280
are now putting theanine
into energy drinks.

2115
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,650
I am not a big fan of most energy drinks.

2116
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,300
Most of them have taurine,

2117
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,647
which I know some of you
wrote to me and said,

2118
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,720
"Oh, taurine is great
for all these reasons."

2119
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,520
Taurine also has effects
on the microvasculature

2120
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,150
that at least for me, were not good.

2121
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:13,780
It cause bursting of
microvasculature in my sclera,

2122
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:17,230
in my eyes, which is why I'm
not a fan of any energy drink

2123
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:20,350
that has taurine or taurine generally.

2124
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:21,183
But that's just me.

2125
01:23:21,183 --> 01:23:22,200
You have to decide for you.

2126
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,300
I'm sure in the comment section,

2127
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,410
there'll be a couple of
taurinesters out there

2128
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,540
that will say, "But I love taurine."

2129
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:27,710
Great.

2130
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,110
Keep the taurine companies in business.

2131
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,230
But it's not for me.

2132
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,440
And I'd like people to know

2133
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,980
that it may or may not be for them.

2134
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,540
The other supplement that can
be very useful is ashwagandha.

2135
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,340
Ashwagandha is known to
lower anxiety and cortisol.

2136
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:45,090
There is six, there are,
excuse me, six studies

2137
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:47,640
that collectively show
reductions in cortisol,

2138
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,600
which is cortisol is typically associated

2139
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,410
with waking up in the
morning, which is good.

2140
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:54,200
That's a healthy, brief
cortisol bump that goes away

2141
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,830
provided you're getting your
light at the right time of days

2142
01:23:56,830 --> 01:24:00,220
at correct times of day,
like morning and evening.

2143
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,270
But you don't want cortisol
chronically elevated.

2144
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,450
That's associated with all
the bad stuff about stress.

2145
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:09,350
There's a very strong
effect of ashwagandha.

2146
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:12,120
You can find dosages at examine.com.

2147
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:17,120
They report in across six
studies, 14.5 to 27.9 reduction

2148
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:22,520
in cortisol in otherwise healthy,
but stressed individuals.

2149
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,810
Now, I don't know about kids.

2150
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:26,800
You have to look at what it
says on various supplements.

2151
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,810
Most things here are being done in adults.

2152
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,280
So, please check carefully.

2153
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,450
But this is great.

2154
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:33,500
I mean, the opportunity for me anyway,

2155
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,240
to be able to take something

2156
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,660
that can help me reduce my cortisol

2157
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,563
so that I don't get some of the
long-term effects of stress.

2158
01:24:39,563 --> 01:24:41,930
And I'm not going to take
ashwagandha year round.

2159
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:43,230
I would only do this if I was feeling

2160
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:46,360
like I wasn't managing my short
and medium-term stress well.

2161
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,790
So, I don't take it on a regular basis.

2162
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:50,310
I do take it when I'm in these times

2163
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:52,690
when things are particularly stressful.

2164
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:57,470
It has their five other studies
that show reduced stress.

2165
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:59,200
So, that's not cortisol measurements,

2166
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,493
but things like fatigue,
cognitive impairment, et cetera.

2167
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,660
It does lower total cholesterol,

2168
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:09,770
which may or may not be good
or bad for you up to 10%.

2169
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,740
So, some people don't want
their cholesterol lowered.

2170
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,140
Some people might.

2171
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:16,110
Cholesterol, we'll talk about
this in a month on hormones,

2172
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:18,810
but cholesterol is the molecule
from which testosterone

2173
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:21,770
and estrogen and cortisol for
that matter are synthesized.

2174
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:23,780
So, you don't want to get
your cholesterol so low,

2175
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,650
then there are all sorts
of negative effects,

2176
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,850
but you don't want it too high either.

2177
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,645
Mild effects in good clinical studies

2178
01:25:29,645 --> 01:25:31,720
on reducing depression,

2179
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,420
probably associated with
the effects on stress

2180
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,920
and some other things as well.

2181
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,080
So, ashwagandha is something
I use from time to time.

2182
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,430
It's kind of interesting.

2183
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:44,880
L-theanine, I rarely will
use those during the daytime,

2184
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,990
except under conditions

2185
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,470
where I'm feeling chronically stressed.

2186
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:50,320
So, check out the human
effect matrix on examine.com.

2187
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
Again, a phenomenal website.

2188
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,870
I think I've sent them
a few emails before.

2189
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,930
That's the only exchanges
I've ever had with them.

2190
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:57,990
But I just think it's wonderful

2191
01:25:57,990 --> 01:25:59,340
that they put together this resource.

2192
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,470
Otherwise we'd be stuck mining PubMed.

2193
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:04,820
They've collated the papers from PubMed

2194
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,850
with links to PubMed.

2195
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:07,670
So, terrific resource.

2196
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:10,550
So, social connection
and some supplementation.

2197
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:14,090
Of course, diet, exercise,
sleep for long-term stress.

2198
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:18,070
And now we're finally in
a position to talk about

2199
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:21,270
what we have set out to
do from the beginning,

2200
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:24,210
which is spend the month on emotions.

2201
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:27,100
It was very important
that we discuss stress

2202
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,390
and we discuss in the
context of short, medium,

2203
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,640
and long-term stress.

2204
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,930
That we discuss tools for
short-term, medium-term,

2205
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,010
and long-term control.

2206
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,080
I don't really want to
say mitigation of stress.

2207
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,110
Stress is going to happen.

2208
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:43,220
But our ability to modulate
and control stress in real time

2209
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:46,550
offline using tools such as respiration,

2210
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,360
using tools such as dilation of gaze,

2211
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,910
using tools like social
connection, maybe some supplements,

2212
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:53,280
certainly take care of your sleep

2213
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,193
and nutrition and exercise.

2214
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:58,190
Again, tons of resources

2215
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,310
and information in the sleep episodes.

2216
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:01,143
So, you can look there.

2217
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:05,170
We will do a month on hormones,
on exercise, et cetera.

2218
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:06,760
But let's talk about emotions

2219
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,880
because in subsequent episodes,

2220
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,650
we're going to talk about OCD,

2221
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,040
we're going to talk about depression,

2222
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,970
we're going to talk about mania,

2223
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:16,660
we're going to be talking about dopamine

2224
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,580
and all sorts of things.

2225
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:22,380
But at the core of
emotions is this question,

2226
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:23,800
what is an emotion?

2227
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,950
Well, it's complex.

2228
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:27,340
There isn't a single brain area
for any one of these things

2229
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,020
that we call emotions.

2230
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,770
My framework, and I
think the modern science,

2231
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:36,770
both psychology and neuroscience
is pretty well-aligned

2232
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:41,590
with what Lisa Feldman
Barrett has taught about.

2233
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,240
Now, Lisa's at Northeastern University.

2234
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,410
She runs a big lab there.

2235
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:46,580
She's a world expert in emotion.

2236
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:48,540
She's written two books
that are really wonderful.

2237
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,390
One is "How Emotions Are Made,"
which was her first book.

2238
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:55,712
The second one is "Seven and
a Half Facts About the Brain."

2239
01:27:55,712 --> 01:27:56,850
It's a wonderful book as well.

2240
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,180
It came out more recently.

2241
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,230
I hosted Lisa on an Instagram live once.

2242
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:03,470
Maybe we'll get her here on
the podcast if we're lucky.

2243
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:05,080
We don't agree on everything

2244
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,390
about the neuroscience of emotions,

2245
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,150
but I subscribed to most everything

2246
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:11,060
that I've heard Lisa say.

2247
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:15,160
In particular, the fact that
emotions are context-dependent.

2248
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,550
There's a cultural dependence, et cetera.

2249
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,600
I look at things mainly

2250
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,337
through the lens of
physiology and neuroscience

2251
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:23,120
and kind of low-level circuitry.

2252
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,780
And one way to think about emotions

2253
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,200
that I think is consistent

2254
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,910
and I think Lisa would generally approve,

2255
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,743
I can't speak for her,

2256
01:28:29,743 --> 01:28:31,060
but I would hope she
would generally approve

2257
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,893
of this description,

2258
01:28:31,893 --> 01:28:36,440
is that when our internal
state of stress or calm

2259
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,020
matches the demands on us

2260
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,300
or is mismatched from the demands on us,

2261
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,540
we tend to interpret those as good or bad.

2262
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,330
Let me give you an example.

2263
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:51,330
If I am feeling very anxious,
very stressed inside,

2264
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,580
and I have a lot to do,

2265
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:58,160
that doesn't feel good, but
it's really no different

2266
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,260
than if I'm very tired
and I have a lot to do

2267
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,460
because there's this mismatch.

2268
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,400
I'm not in the right internal state,

2269
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,330
my internal state is incorrect rather,

2270
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,870
to meet the demands that
are being placed upon me.

2271
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:10,940
So, in both cases, whether I'm too tired

2272
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:13,510
or I'm too stressed to
do what I need to do,

2273
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:16,410
the valence, meaning the
value that I assigned to that

2274
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:18,340
is I don't feel good.

2275
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,910
It's not a good situation
and I don't feel good.

2276
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:23,070
Now, I might call it stressed,
I might call it anxious,

2277
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:25,960
I might call it worried, I might
call it a number of things,

2278
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,793
but it's not good.

2279
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:31,180
However, when I'm tired
and I want to fall asleep,

2280
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:33,540
well then I feel good because
that's what the demand is.

2281
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,100
I need to go to sleep and I'm tired.

2282
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,640
If I'm wide awake and
I need to fall asleep,

2283
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:38,680
then that's not good.

2284
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:42,230
And then the brain tends
to go down the direction

2285
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:44,550
of interpreting the
situation as a bad one.

2286
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:48,310
So, while the discussion around
emotions is far more nuanced

2287
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:50,460
and more elaborate than this,

2288
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,820
one way to think about your
relationship to emotions

2289
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,670
is whether or not your internal state

2290
01:29:54,670 --> 01:29:57,570
is matching the demands that are upon you.

2291
01:29:57,570 --> 01:30:01,410
So, in that way, we don't
really place so much value

2292
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:03,840
on whether or not we're
feeling alert or sleepy.

2293
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,820
We only place value on
whether or not that alertness

2294
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:09,070
whether or not it's
full-blown stress or not

2295
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,520
or our sleepiness, whether
or not we're falling asleep

2296
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,020
or just a little bit drowsy,

2297
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,600
whether or not that matches
the conditions that we face.

2298
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,410
And it's a useful framework to have.

2299
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,040
And it's the reason in part

2300
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,970
why I spent this last
hour and a half or so

2301
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:25,830
talking about stress and
how to control stress.

2302
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:26,887
One reason we did that is

2303
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:28,530
because I think it's
a valuable opportunity

2304
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,690
to learn some tools and understand stress

2305
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,600
and really learn how to
take control of stress,

2306
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,730
which I think we could all benefit

2307
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:36,010
from doing regardless of age.

2308
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:38,240
The other reason is that
when you start to understand

2309
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,690
that you have this kind of
see-saw system in your body,

2310
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:42,710
this autonomic nervous
system that takes you

2311
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:46,930
from alert and calm to
stressed to full-blown panic,

2312
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:48,260
it has that capacity,

2313
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:53,260
or from sleepy and drowsy
to passing out tired

2314
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,350
to God forbid, let's hope
never, but a coma, right?

2315
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:00,620
That you're basically on
this see-saw all the time.

2316
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:03,870
And where you are on that
see-saw of alertness or calmness

2317
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:08,083
positions you to be in better reaction

2318
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:10,790
to the demands that you face.

2319
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,230
Whether or not the thing that you face

2320
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:15,230
is a need to fall asleep or to
listen quietly and not react.

2321
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,950
You now know, for instance,

2322
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:19,860
that if your job is to take feedback,

2323
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,680
when maybe you're going
in for a job evaluation

2324
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,420
or you're in a relationship

2325
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:26,340
where there was a call for a discussion

2326
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,270
and somebody needs to talk
to you about something

2327
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,540
and we need to talk about something,

2328
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:30,373
you're going to there you're like,

2329
01:31:30,373 --> 01:31:33,070
"Goodness, this is going to be rough."

2330
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,320
Learning to reduce that
stress response a little bit

2331
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,830
so that you are in a position to hear

2332
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,970
the information better,

2333
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:41,420
and remember, from a previous episode,

2334
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,253
if you close your eyes,

2335
01:31:42,253 --> 01:31:44,830
you'll be able to actually
focus on the information better.

2336
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:46,730
There's your permission to
not look someone directly

2337
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:47,660
in the eye when they talk to you

2338
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:49,950
if you really want to hear
what they have to say.

2339
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:53,370
You will be able to modulate
that stress response

2340
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:55,110
and lean into life better.

2341
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:59,060
You will be able to react to
things in a more effective way

2342
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,070
and to not be reactive.

2343
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:04,840
And this is really one of the
important things to me anyway,

2344
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,740
is that so much of the
language around psychology,

2345
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:09,390
which I think is a wonderful field,

2346
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,360
but pop psychology in
particular is be responsive,

2347
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,230
not reactive.

2348
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:14,110
Well, great.

2349
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,130
But then how does one do that?

2350
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:15,963
Well, one does that

2351
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:19,170
by modulating their short-term
stress response in real time.

2352
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,330
Not by saying, "Hold
on, I need to meditate.

2353
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:22,590
Hold on, I need a massage

2354
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:23,740
and then I can have this conversation."

2355
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,050
By modulating the reactivity in real time.

2356
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:30,400
How does one, for instance, be mindful?

2357
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,010
Which is a beautiful concept,
but how are you mindful?

2358
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,940
Well, I don't know, when
I'm moving through my day,

2359
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:37,410
a lot of times I'm just
trying to get things done.

2360
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:40,940
And as soon as I start monitoring
and seeing what I'm doing

2361
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:43,070
and kind of third-personing
what I'm doing,

2362
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:44,780
it actually takes me
out of the effectiveness

2363
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:45,870
and experience of what I'm doing.

2364
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:47,900
So for me, sometimes that mindfulness,

2365
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,480
that observer, as they call it,

2366
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,060
is something that doesn't help me.

2367
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,240
It actually hinders me.

2368
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,580
What's important to me is
to be able to work and focus

2369
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:56,580
and then to be able to disengage.

2370
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,620
To be able to do a non-sleep depressed

2371
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:59,990
or to be able to still fall asleep

2372
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:02,430
even though I've been
working hard until 9:30

2373
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:03,790
to put my head down at 10 o'clock

2374
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:08,070
and be out cold sleeping by 10:02.

2375
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:09,630
That's possible if you can learn

2376
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:12,050
to control this stress response.

2377
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:14,730
And to do that, we can't
use the mind to control.

2378
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,090
The mind, we need tools.

2379
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,630
And so, a lot of the people being grumpy

2380
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,810
or anxious or depressed,

2381
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,200
a lot of that,

2382
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,830
provided it's not for some
underlying neurochemical reason

2383
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:26,663
that's chronic,

2384
01:33:26,663 --> 01:33:29,540
a lot of that come from
being poorly rested,

2385
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:32,160
from overworked, from
feeling like the world

2386
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:33,180
is bearing down on us.

2387
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:36,650
And so, rather than take
a subjective view of this,

2388
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:39,120
I take the view of objective physiology.

2389
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,570
What can we do that's anchored
to these neuronal systems

2390
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:44,470
in our body, in our brain, in our eyes,

2391
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:45,820
in our diaphragm, et cetera,

2392
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,870
and look to those as tools leavers

2393
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:49,450
that we can pull on and push

2394
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:51,240
and maneuver through life in a way

2395
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,100
where we start to feel
like we have some agency.

2396
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,450
We actually have some real control

2397
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:57,010
because we're controlling
the internal landscape.

2398
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,640
So, I think that ought to set the stage

2399
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,730
for where we're headed next,

2400
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,350
which is to talk about all the things

2401
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:05,170
that you normally think of
when you think of emotions,

2402
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:07,270
like happiness, like awe, like joy.

2403
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:09,040
And we will get into some of that.

2404
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,140
But all of that rests
firmly on the foundation

2405
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:15,310
of this thing we call the
autonomic nervous system.

2406
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,800
This stress modulation.

2407
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,580
This calming modulation system.

2408
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,490
And again, whether or not
you're activated or you're calm

2409
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:25,850
is not good or bad, it
depends on the situation.

2410
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:27,140
Certainly, when you want to fall asleep,

2411
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:28,260
being activated isn't good.

2412
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:30,860
When you have work to do,
being activated is great.

2413
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:34,290
So, I hope today you were able to take

2414
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:37,820
a slightly different view of
this thing that we call stress.

2415
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:40,110
Not just see it as evil,
but see it as powerful

2416
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:41,910
and useful in certain contexts.

2417
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,770
Great for us in certain contexts

2418
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:45,572
and problematic in other contexts.

2419
01:34:45,572 --> 01:34:47,930
And as well to think
about the various tools

2420
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:51,320
that I've presented that
can allow you to adjust

2421
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:55,060
and modulate your internal
levels of alertness or calmness

2422
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:57,450
so that you can lean more
effectively into life,

2423
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:00,110
which includes sleep and social connection

2424
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:01,820
and the work you have to do.

2425
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:05,440
And of course, acknowledges
that the events in the world

2426
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,870
are beyond our control.

2427
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:08,920
What's in our control
is how we react to them.

2428
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,810
Something that's commonly said
in the wellness and self-help

2429
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,800
and psychology world,

2430
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,080
but for which there often
aren't as many concrete tools

2431
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:20,120
that we can really look
to and trust in real time.

2432
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,940
And of course, there are
other tools out there.

2433
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:25,830
As always, I'll say it,
I strive to be accurate,

2434
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:27,450
but I'll never be exhaustive.

2435
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:28,860
I might have exhausted you.

2436
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:32,350
I might've cured your insomnia
with this discussion today,

2437
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:33,580
but in all seriousness,

2438
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,990
my goal is to bring you
tools and information

2439
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:38,620
so that you can manage
better through life.

2440
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:40,300
So, thanks so much.

2441
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,870
I very much want to thank all of you

2442
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,860
for your support for the podcast.

2443
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:45,800
It's really been wonderful.

2444
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,530
If you've subscribed to the podcast

2445
01:35:47,530 --> 01:35:49,830
on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,

2446
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,320
or maybe even all three, terrific.

2447
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,430
If you haven't, please do subscribe

2448
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:56,480
on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,
or maybe even all three,

2449
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,060
which would be wonderful.

2450
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,590
On Apple, you can leave a five-star review

2451
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:01,850
if you think we deserve that

2452
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:05,030
as well as a comment reviewing us.

2453
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:06,620
If you have suggestions,

2454
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:10,180
if you have questions regarding
the content of the podcast

2455
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,840
or things that you'd like
us to cover in the future,

2456
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,470
please put those in the comment
section on YouTube as well.

2457
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:19,050
If you could recommend
the podcast to friends,

2458
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:21,350
family members, coworkers,
that you think would benefit

2459
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,183
from the information,

2460
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:24,640
maybe even send them
the links if you like,

2461
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,740
that's tremendously helpful.

2462
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,400
Today, as in previous episodes,
I've touched on some things

2463
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,230
as they relate to supplementation.

2464
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:34,080
As always, I always cover a lot of tools

2465
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,810
that are zero-cost tools

2466
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:38,240
that don't involve
ingesting anything at all,

2467
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,740
behavioral tools.

2468
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:41,370
But I mentioned some supplements

2469
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,163
that I particularly find useful.

2470
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,520
With supplements, it's
a complicated landscape,

2471
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,240
often because many supplement companies

2472
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:50,340
don't put in the bottle

2473
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,670
what they say is in
the particular product.

2474
01:36:54,670 --> 01:36:58,360
We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2475
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,710
because Thorne is a supplement company

2476
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,180
that we know to have the
highest levels of stringency.

2477
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:05,070
It's used by the Mayo Clinic.

2478
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:07,390
It's used by all the
major sports organizations

2479
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:08,500
for that particular reason

2480
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,400
and because their quality
standards are exceptionally high.

2481
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,600
If you'd like to try any supplements

2482
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,649
and see the ones that I
take, you can go to Thorne,

2483
01:37:16,649 --> 01:37:21,649
thorne.com/u/huberman.

2484
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,840
And if you do that,

2485
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,030
you'll get 20% off anything
that's listed there on my page

2486
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:30,330
as well as any of the
supplements that Thorne sells.

2487
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:35,190
So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman

2488
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,570
to get 20% off anything that Thorne sells.

2489
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:43,040

2491
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,380
I also do some content on "Huberman Lab,"

2492
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:49,620
a little neuroscience posts.

2493
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,550
Some are reposts of
clips from the podcast.

2494
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:53,680
Others are unique content

2495
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,480
that you won't find on the podcast.

2496
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,600
So you can follow us @hubermanlab.

And most of all, and as always,

2500
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:07,270
really appreciate your
time and attention today.

2501
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:09,170
I hope you practice some of the tools

2502
01:38:09,170 --> 01:38:10,090
if they're right for you.

2503
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:12,130
I hope you think hard about stress

2504
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:14,990
and how you can control your stress.

2505
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:17,750
And above all, as always,

2506
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,073
thank you for your interest in science.
