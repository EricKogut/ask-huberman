00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,720
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,107
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:09,530
(energetic music)

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,550
I'm Andrew Huberman

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,480
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,740
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,767
Today's podcast episode
is all about sleep,

9
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,650
and we're also going to talk about

10
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,860
the mirror image of sleep,
which is wakefulness.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,580
Now, these two phases of our life,

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,220
sleep and wakefulness,

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,600
govern everything about our
mental and physical health,

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
and we're not just gonna talk about

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,190
what's useful about sleep,

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,170
we're also gonna talk about
how to get better at sleeping,

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,870
and that will include how to
get better at falling asleep,

18
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,950
timing your sleep, and
accessing better sleep quality.

19
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,670
In doing so, we're also gonna discuss

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,820
how to get more focused
and alert in wakefulness,

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,660
so because sleep and
wakefulness are related,

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,610
we really can't have a
conversation about one

23
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,100
without the other.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,750
Now, in keeping with this theme,

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,040
you may catch a few
snores in the background.

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,020
Unlike me, my bulldog, Costello,

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,950
can fall asleep anywhere, anytime,

28
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,220
and he happens to be sleeping
over there in the corner,

29
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,360
so if you hear snoring,
that's what that's about.

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,740
As always, I wanna just
mention that this podcast

31
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,920
is part of my effort to bring

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,540
zero-cost-to-consumer public education

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,300
about science and science-related tools,

34
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,870
it is unrelated to my
teaching and research roles

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,220
at Stanford School of Medicine.

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,280
Today's podcast is brought
to us by Helix mattresses,

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
having the proper sleep environment,

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,000
both the environment you're sleeping in

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,870
and the object you're sleeping on,

40
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,650
is critically important to
getting a good night's sleep.

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,140
Helix mattresses are a
little different than most

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,060
because they're matched to
your specific sleep needs,

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,360
as well as whether or not
you tend to run hot or cold

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,660
as you sleep through the night,

45
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,900
what position you sleep in, and so forth,

46
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,520
so if you go to their website,

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,810
they have a quiz that you can take

48
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,760
that matches you to
the particular mattress

49
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,120
that's gonna be best for your sleep needs.

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,950
I've always had a lot of trouble sleeping,

51
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm one of these people
that can fall asleep easily,

52
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,740
but then I wake up

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,780
and I have a hard time
getting back to sleep,

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,880
and once I switched to a Helix mattress

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,383
that was precisely
matched to my sleep needs,

56
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,770
I found I could sleep through the night,

57
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,060
which has made a tremendous
difference for me.

58
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,699
If you wanna try Helix mattresses,

59
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,420
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

60
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,500
and that will give you up to
$200 off on a mattress order,

61
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,780
as well as two pillows free
with your mattress order,

62
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,670
and of course, having the proper pillows

63
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,820
is just as important as
having the proper mattress.

64
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,900
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace,

65
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,610
Headspace is a meditation app

66
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,920
that teaches you how to meditate.

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,130
It's fair to say that now there's

68
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,360
a ton of research out there
in peer-reviewed journals

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,600
supporting the fact that
mindfulness meditation

70
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,630
can support mental and physical health,

71
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,650
but many people find it hard to meditate,

72
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,310
in fact, I'm one of these people.

73
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,780
I started meditating in my teens,

74
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,010
but then I would drop
it every few weeks or so

75
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,260
and then I'd get back to it

76
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,200
maybe the following week or every year,

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,920
I just was not very regular
about my meditation practice,

78
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,590
and then a few years ago I
was flying a lot for work

79
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,040
and I was on JetBlue flights,

80
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,993
and they have Headspace as
part of the choice of things

81
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,140
that you can watch on the TV screen,

82
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,820
and as I started
meditating more regularly,

83
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,910
what I found is my sleep was better,

84
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,050
I would arrive feeling more rested,

85
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,730
it was just a tremendous effects

86
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,060
on my work performance and
other aspects of my life.

87
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,490
If you wanna try Headspace,

88
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,223
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,

89
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,340
if you do that, you'll get one month

90
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,140
of all of Headspace's
meditations for free,

91
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,800
that's the best offer right now,

92
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,773
so if interested, go to
headspace.com/specialoffer.

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,230
So let's talk about sleep,

94
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,020
sleep is this incredible
period of our lives

95
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,360
where we are not conscious.

96
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,510
We might dream, we might
twitch, we might even wake up,

97
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,230
but in sleep, we are only in relation

98
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,910
to things that are happening
within our brain and body.

99
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,910
Outside sensory experience, in most cases,

100
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,860
can't really impact us,

101
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,130
and yet, sleep is this tremendously
important period of life

102
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,210
because it resets our ability

103
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,290
to be focused, alert,
and emotionally stable

104
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,240
in the wakeful period,

105
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,550
so we can't really talk
about wakefulness, focus,

106
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,610
motivation, mood, wellbeing

107
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,160
without thinking about sleep,

108
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,180
and that's why we're
devoting this entire month

109
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,853
to the discussion about sleep.

110
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:20,730
Now, we also can't talk about
sleep and think about sleep

111
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,380
without thinking about wakefulness

112
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,947
because it turns out that
the period that we call sleep

113
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:27,790
and the period we call wakefulness

114
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,690
are tethered to one another.

115
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,500
What we do in the waking state

116
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,030
determines when we fall asleep,

117
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,920
how quickly we fall asleep,

118
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,750
whether or not we stay asleep,

119
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,560
and how we feel when we
wake up the next day,

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,170
and today, we're going to talk mostly

121
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,870
about how to get better at sleeping,

122
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,490
and the reason for starting
the conversation that way

123
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,500
as opposed to just diving into
a lot of biology about sleep,

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,360
is because first of all,

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,330
there's a lot of information
out there already

126
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,380
about the biology of sleep.

127
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,800
We're gonna touch on a little bit of this,

128
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
things like stages of
sleep and sleep spindles,

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,410
melatonin, and dreaming,

130
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,490
but I think that by now,
most people are aware

131
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,410
that getting a really good night's sleep

132
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,590
on a consistent basis
is critically important,

133
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,110
but most people don't know how to do that.

134
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,390
In fact, I'm guessing that
very few of you out there

135
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,220
are consistently getting
seven to nine hours

136
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,090
of really terrific sleep,
waking up feeling rested

137
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,627
and like you're ready to attack the day,

138
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,260
and being able to go through the day

139
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,030
feeling focused and alert

140
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,600
without dips in energy or focus,

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,920
so if you're like most
people, which includes me,

142
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,760
you have some challenges with sleep

143
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,110
at least every third or fifth night or so

144
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,720
and maybe even more often,

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,600
so we're really gonna go tool-heavy today

146
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,040
and talk about tools that
can help you fall asleep,

147
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,690
sleep better, and emerge from
sleep feeling more rested,

148
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,170
and we're gonna do that by
grounding our discussion of tools

149
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,440
in peer-reviewed studies,

150
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
mostly from the last 10 years,

151
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,690
although some even more recent than that,

152
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,120
and we're gonna start by
discussing what is sleep

153
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,370
and what governs the timing
of the onset of sleep,

154
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,590
in other words, what makes you get sleepy

155
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,540
at a particular time of day.

156
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,090
So what determines how well we sleep

157
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,230
and the quality of our wakeful state?

158
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,720
Turns out that's governed by two forces,

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,370
the first force is a chemical force,

160
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,630
it's called adenosine.

161
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,900
Adenosine is a molecule in
our nervous system and body

162
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,790
that builds up the longer we are awake,

163
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,640
so if you've just slept for 8, or 9,

164
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,440
or 10 really deep, restful hours,

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,920
adenosine is gonna be very
low in your brain and body.

166
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,990
If, however, you've been awake
for 10, 15, or more hours,

167
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,730
adenosine levels are
going to be much higher.

168
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,580
Adenosine creates a sort of
sleep drive or a sleep hunger,

169
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,020
and actually, hunger is
the appropriate word here

170
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,910
because for most of what
we're gonna discuss today,

171
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,410
we can think of it in an
analogous way to nutrition.

172
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,400
Your nutrition and how well you feel

173
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,380
after you eat certain foods,

174
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,370
your overall level of fitness

175
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,160
and your cellular health
and your heart health

176
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,130
isn't governed by any one food item

177
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,630
that you might eat or not eat,

178
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,450
it's governed by a number
of different factors,

179
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,440
how often you eat, how much you eat,

180
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,410
which items you eat, et cetera,

181
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,460
and what works best for you.

182
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,180
In the same way, your
sleep and your wakefulness

183
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,910
are the product of kind of the average

184
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,740
of a number of different behaviors,

185
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,750
how long you've been awake is a key one

186
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,330
because of this molecule, adenosine.

187
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,970
So the reason you get sleepy
when you've been up for a while

188
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,860
is because adenosine
is creeping up steadily

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,630
the longer you've been awake,

190
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,920
and a good way to remember
this and think about adenosine

191
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,380
is to think about caffeine.

192
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,280
Caffeine, for most people,

193
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,400
except a very small percentage of people,

194
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,070
wakes them up, it makes
them feel more alert,

195
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,780
in fact, some people are
so sensitive to caffeine

196
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,240
that they feel jittery if they drink it

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,670
even in small amounts,

198
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,820
other people can drink
large amounts of caffeine

199
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,763
and not feel jittery at all.

200
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,310
Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist,

201
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,260
what that means is that
when you ingest caffeine,

202
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,430
whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea,

203
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,150
or in any other form,

204
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,750
it binds to the adenosine receptor,

205
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,760
it sort of parks there just like a car

206
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,520
would park in a given parking slot,

207
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,950
and therefore, adenosine
can't park in that slot.

208
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,253
Now, when caffeine parks in
the adenosine receptor slot,

209
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,149
nothing really happens
downstream of that receptor,

210
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,600
the receptor can't engage

211
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,297
the normal cellular
functions of making that cell

212
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:41,570
and you feel sleepy.

213
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,380
So the reason caffeine wakes you up

214
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,120
is because it blocks
the sleepiness receptor,

215
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,840
it blocks the sleepy signal,

216
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,550
and this is why when
that caffeine wears off,

217
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,620
adenosine will bind to that receptor,

218
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,570
sometimes with even greater,
what we call affinity,

219
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,110
and you feel the crash,
you feel especially tired.

220
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,437
Now, I'm not here to demonize
caffeine, I love caffeine,

221
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:05,810
and I drink it in the morning

222
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,550
and I drink it in the afternoon,

223
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,610
but I'm one of these people

224
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,970
that, either because of my tolerance

225
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,270
or because of some genetic variations

226
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,730
that exist among people

227
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,400
in terms of their adenosine receptors,

228
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,410
I can drink caffeine

229
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,470
as late as 4:00 or 5:00
p.m. in the evening

230
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,750
and still fall asleep just fine.

231
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,400
Some people can't have any caffeine at all

232
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,760
or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m.

233
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,030
or else their sleep is totally disrupted.

234
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,810
All of this has to do
with the relationship

235
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,860
between adenosine and
these adenosine receptors,

236
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,050
genetic variation,

237
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,230
things that are very hard to
find out except experimentally,

238
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,160
meaning each of you needs to decide

239
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,860
and figure out for yourselves

240
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,670
whether or not you can tolerate caffeine

241
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,320
and at what times of day
you can tolerate caffeine

242
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
in order to still fall asleep
easily and get good sleep,

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,900
so rather than demonize caffeine,

244
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,800
or say that everyone can
drink caffeine until late,

245
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
you need to figure out
what's right for you.

246
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,220
Caffeine has a lot of health benefits,

247
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,630
it also, for some people,

248
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,320
can be problematic for health,

249
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,430
it can raise blood pressure, et cetera,

250
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,720
caffeine increases this molecule

251
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,260
that's a neuromodulator
that we call dopamine,

252
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,190
we discussed this in episode one,

253
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,620
which tends to make us
feel good, motivated,

254
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,230
and give us energy

255
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,410
because, as you may have
learned in episode one,

256
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,300
dopamine is related to
another neuromodulator

257
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,420
called epinephrine, which gives us energy,

258
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,880
in fact, epinephrine
is made from dopamine.

259
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
So let's just take a step back

260
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,900
and think about what we're talking about

261
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,670
when we're talking about sleepiness,

262
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,920
sleepiness is driven by
increases in adenosine

263
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,483
that happen naturally,

264
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,700
caffeine prevents the adenosine

265
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
from having its action of making us sleepy

266
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,010
by blocking that receptor,

267
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,510
so it gives us energy and it
increases our dopamine levels,

268
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,550
but some people can't
tolerate caffeine very well,

269
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,680
other people can tolerate it just fine,

270
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,320
so you need to determine
that experimentally.

271
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,890
All the data say there's
tremendous variation,

272
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,060
and right now, the only
way that I'm aware of

273
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,250
for you to decide whether or not

274
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,820
caffeine is a good or a bad thing for you,

275
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,590
and whether or not you should ingest it

276
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,050
at a given time of day or at all

277
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,730
is really to figure that out on your own,

278
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,850
in fact, there's a small subset of people

279
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,440
that can drink caffeine until very late

280
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,110
and they have no trouble falling asleep

281
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,430
because they actually have a mutant form

282
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,090
of the adenosine receptor,

283
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,410
so in keeping with the theme

284
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,550
of science and science-related tools,

285
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,570
this is one of those cases

286
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,960
where I can't give you a
one-size-fits-all prescription

287
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,700
except to say you need to
experiment with caffeine

288
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,280
in a way that's safe for you

289
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,430
and explore that and figure
out what works for you,

290
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,200
and then stick with that.

291
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,570
Okay, so adenosine is
driving this sleep hunger,

292
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,000
when adenosine is low,

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,580
it's like we're well-fed,
we're not very hungry,

294
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,570
and when adenosine is high,

295
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,210
it's like we're fasted for a long time

296
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,870
and we tend to be very hungry,

297
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,270
so that when adenosine is high,

298
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,550
we really wanna fall asleep.

299
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,880
If you want, I'm not suggesting
you do this experiment,

300
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,850
but you can do it,

301
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,350
you can stay up for four more hours

302
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,590
than you're used to staying up

303
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,250
and you'll find that
you're very, very sleepy.

304
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,900
That's because adenosine is building up

305
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,620
at levels higher and higher

306
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,830
because you've been awake
for those extra four hours.

307
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,320
However, if you've ever
pulled an all-nighter,

308
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,200
you'll notice something interesting,

309
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,870
as morning rolls around,

310
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,590
you'll suddenly feel an increase

311
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,500
in your energy and alertness again,

312
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,300
even though adenosine has been building up

313
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,600
for the entire night.

314
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,150
Now, why is that?

315
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,700
The reason that is is because
there's a second force

316
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,800
which is governing when you
sleep and when you're awake,

317
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,740
and that force is a
so-called circadian force,

318
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,440
circadian means about a
day or about 24 hours,

319
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,170
and inside all of us is a clock

320
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,590
that exists in your brain and my brain,

321
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,910
and the brain of every
animal that we're aware of,

322
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,970
that determines when we want to be sleepy

323
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,010
and when we want to be awake.

324
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,843
Just think about it,

325
00:12:58,843 --> 00:12:59,820
we don't go through the day

326
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,950
wanting to fall asleep every 30 minutes

327
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,270
and then feeling like we're wide awake,

328
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,260
our sleep and our period of sleepiness

329
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,700
tends to be condensed into one block,

330
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,180
typically one 6- to 10-hour block,

331
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,850
although there's also variation

332
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,860
in terms of how much people want to sleep,

333
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,060
and we're going to discuss

334
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,370
how you can diagnose
your absolute sleep need

335
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,820
as well as how to recover
sleep that you've lost.

336
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,490
That block of sleep

337
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,690
and when it falls within
each 24-hour cycle

338
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,970
is governed by a number
of different things,

339
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,090
but the most powerful thing

340
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,100
that's governing when
you want to be asleep

341
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,810
and when you want to be awake is light,

342
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,197
and in particular, it's
governed by sunlight,

343
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,020
and I can't emphasize enough

344
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,760
how important and how
actionable this relationship is

345
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,573
between light and when you want to sleep.

346
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,440
It's quite simple on the face of it

347
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,090
and it's quite simple to resolve,

348
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,950
but people tend to make a big mess

349
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,510
of this whole circadian
literature, frankly,

350
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,290
so let's just break it
down from the standpoint

351
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,210
of what's going on in your brain and body

352
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,420
as you go through one 24-hour day.

353
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,850
Let's start with waking,

354
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,970
so regardless of how
well you slept at night

355
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,150
or whether or not you were up all night,

356
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,630
most people tend to wake up

357
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,240
sometime around when the sun rises,

358
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,620
maybe not right at sunrise,

359
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,733
but within an hour or two
or maybe three of sunrise.

360
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,930
Now, I realize there
are night-shift workers

361
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,780
and there are people traveling
and experiencing jet lag

362
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,440
where this is not going to be the case,

363
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,160
we are gonna deal with
jet lag and shift work

364
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,070
at the end of this podcast,

365
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,880
but for most people, we tend to wake up

366
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,450
about the time that the
sun is rising or so,

367
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,570
and as we do that,

368
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,820
adenosine levels tend to
be low if we've been asleep

369
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,160
for reasons that you now understand,

370
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,420
and our system generates
an internal signal

371
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,440
that is in the form of a hormone.

372
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,520
Now, I've talked a lot about

373
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,500
neuromodulators and neurotransmitters,

374
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,510
I haven't talked a lot about
hormones yet on this podcast.

375
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,250
The definition of a hormone
is it's a substance,

376
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,100
a chemical that's released
from one organ in your body

377
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,800
that goes and acts on other
organs elsewhere in your body,

378
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,010
including your nervous system.

379
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,740
When you wake up in the morning,

380
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,390
you wake up because a particular
hormone called cortisol

381
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,710
is released from your adrenal glands,

382
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,830
your adrenal glands sit
right above your kidneys,

383
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,030
and there's a little pulse of cortisol.

384
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,250
There's also a pulse of some,

385
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,150
and when I say a pulse,

386
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,440
I just mean the release of a little bit,

387
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,050
there's also a pulse of
epinephrine, which is adrenaline,

388
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,750
from your adrenals and also in your brain,

389
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,650
and you feel awake.

390
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,980
Now, that pulse of cortisol
and adrenaline and epinephrine

391
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,550
might come from your alarm clock,

392
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,210
it might come from you
naturally waking up,

393
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,480
but it tends to alert your
whole system in your body

394
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,080
that it's time to
increase your heart rate,

395
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,610
it's time to start tensing your muscles,

396
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,000
it's time to start moving about.

397
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,070
It's very important
that that cortisol pulse

398
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,140
come early in the day,

399
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,930
or at least, early in your
period of wakefulness,

400
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,770
I say that because some people
are waking up at 8:00 p.m.

401
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,240
and are sleeping all day,

402
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,280
but it's very important
that that pulse of cortisol

403
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,160
occur early in the day and
that it happens all at once,

404
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,130
it sort of sets a rising tide
of cortisol in your system.

405
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,510
Now, many of you have
probably heard about cortisol

406
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,930
in relation to stress,

407
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,870
and indeed, as we go through
our day and our life,

408
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,150
different stressors, different
events happen in our life

409
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,210
that make us feel more alert.

410
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,480
Some of the more stressful ones

411
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,470
might be looking at your credit card bill

412
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,740
and seeing what seems to
be a fraudulent charge,

413
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,040
or looking at your phone

414
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,970
and suddenly seeing a text that something

415
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,490
you thought was gonna
happen at a particular time

416
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,360
is not gonna happen,

417
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,630
or you're running late,

418
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,030
those will tend to increase norepinephrine

419
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,970
and epinephrine and
adrenaline in your system,

420
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,550
and if they're severe enough,

421
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,030
you'll start getting
some pulses of cortisol

422
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,440
released from your adrenals
throughout the day,

423
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,280
but there's this normal,
healthy rising tide of cortisol

424
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,600
that happens early in the day,

425
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,940
and I say healthy because it wakes you up,

426
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,772
it makes you feel alert,

427
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:08,789
and it makes you feel able
to move and wanting to move

428
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,440
and to go about your day
for work, for exercise,

429
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,720
for school, for social
relations, et cetera.

430
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
So when you wake up in the morning

431
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,770
is when that cortisol pulse takes off,

432
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,030
and something else important happens,

433
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,890
a timer is set in your body
and in your nervous system

434
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,870
that dictates when a different
hormone called melatonin,

435
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,950
which makes you sleepy,

436
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,740
will be secreted from a
particular brain region,

437
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,700
so let's talk about that.

438
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,840
When you wake up in the morning

439
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,020
and you experience that rise in cortisol,

440
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,610
there's a timer that starts going,

441
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,090
and these are cellular timers

442
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,780
and they're dictated by the relation

443
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,670
between different organs in your body,

444
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,230
that says to your brain and body

445
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,110
that in about 12 to 14 hours,

446
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,370
a different hormone, this
hormone we're calling melatonin,

447
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,320
will be released from your pineal gland.

448
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,710
So there's two mechanisms here,

449
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,430
a wakefulness signal
and a sleepiness signal,

450
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,230
and the wakefulness signal
triggers the onset of the timer

451
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,340
for the sleepiness signal.

452
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,610
Now, that sleepiness signal
that we call melatonin

453
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,490
that's released from the pineal

454
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,950
comes only from the pineal.

455
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,180
Unless you're taking exogenous melatonin,

456
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,180
you're supplementing with melatonin,

457
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,910
the only source of melatonin in your body

458
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,950
is going to be this pineal gland,

459
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,540
so let's talk about the
pineal gland for a second.

460
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,250
The pineal gland is a gland

461
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,740
that sits kind of in the
little structure near,

462
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,500
for the aficionados out there,

463
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,590
it's kind of near the fourth ventricle,

464
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,430
it's about the size of a pea,

465
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,430
Descartes, the philosopher,

466
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,330
said that the pineal was
the seat of the soul,

467
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,680
he said that because it's

468
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,480
one of the few structures
in the human brain

469
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,530
that there's only one of them,

470
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,363
you know, most structures,

471
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:54,150
there's one on either side of the brain,

472
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,490
so-called bihemispheric,

473
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,420
but the pineal, there's only one.

474
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,100
I don't know anything about souls, really,

475
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,830
certainly not the science of souls,

476
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,340
but I think it's very unlikely

477
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,890
that the pineal is the seat of the soul,

478
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,220
but it is a very interesting organ

479
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,550
because it's the only organ in our body

480
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,400
that releases melatonin,

481
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,200
and that melatonin makes us
sleepy and lets us fall asleep.

482
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,317
Now, I'm guessing that many
of you are probably asking,

483
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,500
"Should I take melatonin?"

484
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,500
My personal bias on this is,
except in rare cases, no,

485
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,070
for the following reason,

486
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,240
melatonin has a second function,

487
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,510
which is that melatonin

488
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,940
also suppresses the onset of puberty.

489
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,820
In kids, and especially in babies,

490
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,430
melatonin isn't just
released in the evening

491
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,250
12 to 16 hours after we wake,

492
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,860
melatonin is released
chronically, or tonically,

493
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,650
throughout the day and night,

494
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,380
and that chronic or tonic
release of melatonin

495
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,750
is known to suppress some
of the other hormones

496
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,170
in other regions of the brain

497
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,280
that trigger the onset of puberty.

498
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,550
Now, if you or your child
has been taking melatonin,

499
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,900
don't freak out,

500
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,750
as always, any kind of supplement

501
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,940
or anything that you're going
to take or think about taking,

502
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,970
you really need to
consult with your doctor,

503
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,830
I've said this many times on this podcast

504
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,670
and it's in the show notes, et cetera,

505
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,390
but before you remove anything

506
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,000
or add anything to what
you're already doing,

507
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,490
please do consult with a
healthcare professional.

508
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,160
However, melatonin is known

509
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,760
to suppress the onset of puberty,

510
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,420
so much so that regular, cyclic,

511
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,070
cycled periods of melatonin
release from the pineal

512
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,300
really correlate with the onset of puberty

513
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,050
and early adulthood,

514
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,810
meaning as we start secreting
melatonin only at night,

515
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,790
that's also when we tend to
transition out of puberty.

516
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,210
Now, there are a lot of
things that correlate

517
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,090
in our nervous system,

518
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,160
so that doesn't necessarily
mean it controls it,

519
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,750
but in this case we know,

520
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,090
based on lots of data,
endocrinology and so forth,

521
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,200
that melatonin suppresses
the onset of puberty,

522
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,810
so supplementing melatonin
could be problematic

523
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,400
for that reason,

524
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,130
but if you've already
gone through puberty,

525
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,430
it could also have some impact

526
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,540
on other hormone systems in your body,

527
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,970
so that's why I personally

528
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,080
don't like to use
melatonin to fall asleep.

529
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,913
There's another reason,

530
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:14,880
which is that melatonin
will help you fall asleep

531
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,720
but it won't help you stay asleep,

532
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,230
and many people who take melatonin

533
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,770
find that they wake up
three to five hours later

534
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,780
unable to fall back asleep.

535
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,180
Part of the reason for that might be

536
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,790
that melatonin purchased at,

537
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,880
you can buy it over the counter

538
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,420
in most areas of the world
even though it's a hormone,

539
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,300
which is a little unusual,

540
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,670
you can't just go into a
pharmacy, at least in the US,

541
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,420
and buy testosterone or
cortisol or estrogen,

542
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
you need a prescription,

543
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,580
but you can go buy melatonin
for whatever reason,

544
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,780
I don't know the reasons
for that legality,

545
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,950
but it's been shown many times,

546
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,440
and now I'm borrowing from some items

547
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,120
that were in Matt Walker's
book, "Why We Sleep,"

548
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,820
where he stated there is evidence

549
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,230
that, in commercially available melatonin,

550
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,520
the amount of melatonin has
been tested for various brands,

551
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,330
it can range anywhere from being

552
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,610
15% of what's listed on the bottle,

553
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,220
okay, so if they list
this as 100 milligrams,

554
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,960
it would be a tremendously high dose,

555
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,150
it turns out it's only 15 milligrams

556
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,470
in that particular pill or capsule,

557
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,010
or up to 400 times more than
what's listed on the bottle,

558
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,860
so it's completely unregulated,

559
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,050
and so for those of you taking melatonin,

560
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,740
I will discuss at the end of the podcast

561
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,810
some other potential alternatives
that are probably safer

562
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,630
and don't have these issues.

563
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,990
So should you take melatonin?

564
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,410
My personal bias is no,

565
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,520
but for many people, they
find that it does help them,

566
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,040
and so if you do find it helps you,

567
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,800
then just consider what I'm saying

568
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,210
in light of the other
practices that you're doing

569
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,150
and talk to your healthcare professional.

570
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,490
Okay, so the rhythm of
cortisol and melatonin

571
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,110
is what we call endogenous,

572
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,190
it's happening in us all the time

573
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,080
without any external input,

574
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,450
in fact, if we were in complete darkness,

575
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,540
living in a cave with no
artificial lights whatsoever,

576
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,260
or we were in complete brightness

577
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,150
where we never experienced any darkness,

578
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,270
these rhythms of cortisol
and melatonin would continue,

579
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,070
you would have a bump in
cortisol, or a pulse in cortisol,

580
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,530
that would drop off with time,

581
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,300
and then melatonin would come
up about 12 to 14 hours later,

582
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,390
but these endogenous systems of our body,

583
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,650
which are both hormonal and neural,

584
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,930
were set so that external things

585
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,900
could govern when they happen.

586
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,140
Now, this takes us back to
episode one of the podcast

587
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,730
that if you haven't listened to already,

588
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,740
you might wanna listen to,

589
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,360
where we talked about sensation
and perception and all that,

590
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,280
I'm not gonna review it again here,

591
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,090
but there's one particular sensory event,

592
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,000
one particular influence
on your nervous system

593
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,740
that determines when that cortisol

594
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,360
is going to start to rise,

595
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,530
so if you were in complete darkness,

596
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,640
it would happen once per 24-hour cycle,

597
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,320
but it would be somewhat
later and later each day,

598
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,590
whereas under normal circumstances,

599
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,870
what happens is you wake up,

600
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,690
and what happens when you wake up?

601
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,020
You open your eyes.

602
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,440
When your open your eyes,
light comes into your eyes.

603
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,190
Now, the way this system works

604
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,850
is that you have a particular
set of neurons in your eye,

605
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,490
they're called retinal ganglion cells,

606
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,810
you don't have to remember
that if you don't want to,

607
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,410
but these retinal ganglion
cells are brain neurons,

608
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,140
again, the retina is just
the one piece of your brain,

609
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,890
actually, two pieces because
most of you have two retinas,

610
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,930
that resides outside the skull, per se.

611
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,610
When light comes into the eye,

612
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,630
there's a particular group
of retinal ganglion cells,

613
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,950
or type of retinal ganglion cells,

614
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,790
that perceives a particular type of light

615
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,220
and communicates that to this clock

616
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,050
that resides right above
the roof of your mouth

617
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,400
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, okay?

618
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
So I know this can get
a little complicated,

619
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,460
but these retinal ganglion cells,

620
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,447
when you open your eyes, light comes in,

621
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:08,860
and an electrical signal is
sent to this central clock

622
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,150
we call the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

623
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,230
and the suprachiasmatic
nucleus has connections

624
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,850
with essentially every cell
and organ of your body.

625
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,580
Now, it's vitally important

626
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,910
that we get light communicated
to this central clock

627
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,320
in order to time the cortisol
and melatonin properly,

628
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,800
and when I say properly, I
can say that with confidence

629
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,310
because we know based on a lot of evidence

630
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,860
that if you don't get

631
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,030
your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right,

632
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:43,030
there are tremendously
broad and bad effects

633
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,840
on cardiovascular health,
dementia, metabolic effects,

634
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,550
learning, depression, dementia,

635
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,250
in fact, there're so many negative effects

636
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,630
associated with getting this wrong

637
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,360
that I don't wanna get
into it in too much detail,

638
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,260
in fact, I feel like we've been bombarded

639
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,540
with all this information about
how we're not sleeping well,

640
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,730
we're not sleeping at the right times,

641
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,920
we're not sleeping enough,

642
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,780
to the point where people
now have sleep anxiety,

643
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,700
if they can't sleep well for a night,

644
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,250
they're feeling overwhelmed by that

645
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,570
and it's sort of now they're stressed

646
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,740
about not being able to sleep

647
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,170
which is making it harder
to sleep, et cetera.

648
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,570
I really wanna focus on what we can do

649
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,930
to anchor these systems properly,

650
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,190
so let's think about what
happens when we do this correctly

651
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,610
and how to do it correctly.

652
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,890
When we wake up, our eyes open,

653
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,280
now, if we're in a dark room,

654
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,350
there isn't enough light to
trigger the correct timing

655
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,373
of this cortisol-melatonin
thing, these rhythms.

656
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,460
You might say, "Well, why
won't any light do it?"

657
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,700
Well, it turns out that
these neurons in our eye

658
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,360
that set the circadian clock

659
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,340
and then allow our circadian
clock to set all the clocks

660
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,010
of all the cells and organs
and tissues of our body

661
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,470
responds best to a
particular quality of light

662
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,763
and amount of light,

663
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,260
and those are the qualities
of light and amount of light

664
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,420
that come from sunlight,

665
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,110
so these neurons, what
they're really looking for,

666
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,080
although they don't have
a mind of their own,

667
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,510
is the sun at what we
call low solar angle,

668
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,620
the eye and the nervous system

669
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,940
don't know anything about
sunrises or sunsets,

670
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,360
it only knows the quality of light

671
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,000
that comes in when the
sun is low in the sky,

672
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,910
the system evolved so that
when the sun is low in the sky,

673
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,010
there's a particular contrast
between yellows and blues

674
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,510
that triggers the
activation of these cells,

675
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,110
so if you wake up and
you look at your phone

676
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,943
or your computer,

677
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,040
or you flip on a bunch
of artificial lights,

678
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,990
will these cells be activated?

679
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,650
And the answer is, sort of,

680
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,000
they'll be activated but
not in the optimal way.

681
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,590
What you want to do is
get sunlight in your eyes

682
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,960
as close to waking as possible.

683
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,420
Now, I wanna be really clear about this

684
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,300
because I've talked about it

685
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,770
on other podcasts when I was a guest

686
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,940
and I talked about it
on my Instagram feed,

687
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,350
and there seemed to be the same questions

688
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,250
coming up again and again,

689
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,140
these neurons don't know sunlight, per se,

690
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,450
they don't know sunrise or
sunset, for that matter,

691
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,580
they don't know artificial
light from sunlight,

692
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,480
what they respond best to,

693
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,590
however, is the quality
and amount of light

694
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,180
that comes in when the
sun is low in the sky,

695
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,570
that means that if you can
watch the sunrise, great,

696
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,020
that's perfect for triggering
activation of these cells,

697
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,210
however, if you wake up a
few hours after the sunrise,

698
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,150
which I tend to most days, personally,

699
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,850
you still wanna get
outside and view sunlight,

700
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,130
you don't need the sunlight

701
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,820
beaming you directly in the eyes,

702
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,190
there's a lot of photons, light energy,

703
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,790
that's scattered from
sunlight at this time,

704
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,520
but the key is to get that light energy,

705
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,090
from sunlight, ideally, into your eyes.

706
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,097
Now, I know many of
you are already asking,

707
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:51,740
"Well, I live in Scandinavia,"

708
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,937
or, "I can't get sunlight,

709
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:54,690
"there's buildings around me," et cetera,

710
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,740
we will get to all of that,

711
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,050
but it's critically important

712
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,510
that you get outside to get this light.

713
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,380
I had a discussion with
a colleague of mine,

714
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,730
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, who's in
the Department of Psychiatry

715
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,500
and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,

716
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,530
a world expert in this,

717
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,530
and he tells me that it's
50 times less effective

718
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,570
to view this sunlight through a window,

719
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,230
through a car windshield,

720
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,190
or through the side window of a car

721
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,210
than it is to just get
outside with no sunglasses

722
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,780
and view light early in the day.

723
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,760
Now, if you can't see the sunrise,

724
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,920
like I said, you can see this

725
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,530
within an hour or two of sunrise,

726
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,150
but it has to be low solar angle,

727
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,590
once the sun is overhead,
the quality of light shifts

728
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,660
so that you miss this opportunity

729
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,510
to time the cortisol pulse,

730
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,000
and that turns out to
be a bad thing to do,

731
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,180
you really wanna time that
cortisol pulse properly

732
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,360
because, we'll get into this
a little bit more later,

733
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,510
but a late-shifted cortisol pulse,

734
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,570
in particular, a 9:00 p.m. or
8:00 p.m. increase in cortisol

735
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,570
is one of the consequences,
and maybe one of the causes,

736
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,540
of a lot of anxiety
disorders and depression,

737
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,660
so it's kind of a chicken-egg thing,

738
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,640
we don't know whether or
not it's correlated with,

739
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,600
it's the cause, or the effect,

740
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,880
but it's a signature of
depression and anxiety disorder.

741
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,720
Bringing that cortisol pulse
earlier in your wakeful period,

742
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,540
earlier in your day,

743
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,360
has positive benefits
ranging from blood pressure

744
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,530
to mental health, et cetera,

745
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,560
not gonna list them all off

746
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,240
because there's just so many of them,

747
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,450
but many, many positive things happen

748
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,630
when you are getting the
cortisol early in the day

749
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,400
far away from your melatonin pulse.

750
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,090
Okay, so how long should you be outside?

751
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,300
Well, this is gonna vary tremendously

752
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,870
because some people live in environments

753
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,710
where it's very bright,

754
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,560
so let's say it's Colorado
in the middle of winter,

755
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,327
there's a snowfield,
there's no cloud cover,

756
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,030
and you walk outside,

757
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,230
there's going to be so
much photon light energy

758
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,700
arriving on your retina

759
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,860
that it probably only
takes 30 to 60 seconds

760
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,480
to trigger the central clock

761
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
and set your cortisol and
melatonin rhythms properly

762
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,163
and get everything lined up nicely,

763
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,000
whereas if you're in Scandinavia
in the depths of winter

764
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,977
and you wake up at 5:00 a.m.

765
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:13,770
and the sun is just barely
creeping across the horizon

766
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,210
and then goes back down
again a few hours later,

767
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,930
you probably are not
getting enough sunlight

768
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,270
in order to set these rhythms,

769
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,540
so many people find that they need to use

770
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,070
sunlight simulators in the
form of particular lights

771
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,840
that were designed to simulate sunlight,

772
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,090
however, and I'm not out to attack

773
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,900
the companies that produce those,

774
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,793
there's another solution to that,

775
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,100
you can simply go outside for longer,

776
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,270
even if there's a lot
of dense cloud cover,

777
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:47,270
you're probably getting anywhere
from 10,000 to 50,000 lux,

778
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,520
L-U-X, which is just a
measure of light energy,

779
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,163
and that should be sufficient
to set the circadian clock.

780
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,377
You could say, "Well, the
lights in my house or my phone

781
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,887
"are really, really bright, right?

782
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:01,657
"Everyone's telling us to
stay off our phones at night

783
00:32:01,657 --> 00:32:03,290
"because they're really bright,"

784
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:06,370
but guess what, it turns
out that early in the day,

785
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,270
your retina is not very sensitive,

786
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,160
which means you need a lot of photons,

787
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,570
ideally coming from sunlight,

788
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,320
to set these clock mechanisms,

789
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,600
so looking at your phone or
artificial lights is fine

790
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,890
if you wake up before sunrise,

791
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,200
but it's not going to work to
set these clock mechanisms,

792
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,700
and this is supported by
dozens, if not hundreds,

793
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,140
of quality peer-reviewed studies,

794
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,710
so you wanna use sunlight,

795
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,850
if you can't see sunlight
because of your environment,

796
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,150
then you are going to have
to opt for artificial light,

797
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,680
and in that case, you're going
to want an artificial light

798
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,090
that either simulates sunlight
or has a lot of blue light.

799
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,830
Now, without going off course here,

800
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,857
you might be saying,

801
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:48,930
"Wait, I've heard blue
light is bad for me."

802
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,850
Actually, blue light is
great for this mechanism

803
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,763
during the day,

804
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,070
we can talk about blue
light and blue blockers,

805
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,160
but you really want a lot
of blue and yellow light

806
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,040
arriving on the retina early in the day.

807
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,870
Let me be clear about something,

808
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,320
you never ever want to look at any light,

809
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,270
sunlight or artificial light,

810
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,030
that is painful to look at.

811
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,790
If you find that your eyes are watering

812
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,490
or you're having challenges maintaining,

813
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,180
you know, looking at
this thing for a while

814
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
because it's painful,

815
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
that light is too bright

816
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,050
and you do not wanna damage your retina,

817
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,090
so you don't wanna gaze at
the sun refusing to blink

818
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,110
and burn your retina, that's
actually possible to do,

819
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,383
you don't wanna do that.

820
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,100
You have a proper blink reflex
installed in you since birth,

821
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,787
and if you feel like
something's too bright

822
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:35,710
and you need to blink,

823
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,830
it means you need to blink,
that it's too much light,

824
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,870
so please don't beam your
eyes with really bright light,

825
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,810
but blue light,

826
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,460
in particular, blue light and yellow light

827
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,030
coming from sunlight is ideal,

828
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,100
if you're going to get
it from artificial light

829
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,650
because you can't get enough sunlight,

830
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,180
well, then, artificial lights

831
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,710
that are rich in blue, blue wavelengths,

832
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,870
are going to be ideal for
setting this mechanism.

833
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,447
A lot of people will say, "Oh, I should be

834
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:01,270
"wearing blue blockers
throughout the day."

835
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,020
No, that's the exact wrong thing,

836
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,710
if you're going to use blue blockers,

837
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,600
we can talk about that,

838
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,409
that should be reserved
for late in the evening

839
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,702
because light suppresses melatonin.

840
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,900
I've been asked many times
before about this pineal gland

841
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,440
and there are a lot of ancient practices

842
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,090
that map to some of the
things that I'm saying,

843
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,817
and people will always say,
"Oh, I heard that sunlight

844
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,719
"is great for the pineal."

845
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,409
Well, perhaps, but we have
to careful about that phrase,

846
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,179
sunlight inhibits the pineal,

847
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,299
it prevents it from releasing melatonin,

848
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,210
darkness allows the pineal
to release melatonin,

849
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,989
so the pineal is not the gland
or the organ of sunlight,

850
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,899
it is the gland of darkness,

851
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,230
in fact, melatonin can be
thought of as a sleepiness signal

852
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,980
that's correlated with darkness,

853
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,070
so get up each morning,
try and get outside,

854
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,719
I know that can be challenging for people,

855
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,120
but anywhere from 2 to 10
minutes of sunlight exposure

856
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,880
is going to work well for most people,

857
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,740
and you wanna do this on a regular basis

858
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,620
and you don't have to do
it exactly at sunrise,

859
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,230
I realize I'm repeating myself,

860
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,360
but somehow, despite
barking at people about this

861
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,000
for a couple years now,

862
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,430
I keep getting the same questions,

863
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,693
and somehow, it hasn't been sinking in,

864
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,860
which could be related to
some circadian disorder,

865
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,640
I'm just kidding, if it's not sinking in,

866
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,210
it's probably that I'm not being effective

867
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,680
in communicating the information,

868
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,640
but get that bright light
early in the day from sunlight,

869
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,860
and if you can't get it from sunlight,

870
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,220
get it from artificial light.

871
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,000
What kinds of artificial lights will work?

872
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,150
Well, there are these sunrise simulators,

873
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,280
but the ring lights that
people use for selfies

874
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,800
and this sort of thing,
for posting on Instagram,

875
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,100
those generate a lot of blue light.

876
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,090
If wanna get experimental about this,

877
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,690
there's a free app, I have
no relationship to the app,

878
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,840
but it's a great app called Light Meter

879
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,630
that you can use your phone

880
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,070
and you can measure the
amount of photon energy

881
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,000
in your environment,

882
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
and it's kind of a fun experiment to do,

883
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,640
you can go outside in the morning

884
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,190
and you'll see that
there's 10,000, 20,000 lux,

885
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,100
even though it might
seem like it's kinda dim

886
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,740
or there's tree cover or cloud cover,

887
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,940
you go inside and you
shine an artificial light

888
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,773
at your phone,

889
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:09,150
press the button on Light Meter

890
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,990
and you'll find that it's
only 500 or 1,000 lux,

891
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,350
and you realize that even
though it seems really bright,

892
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,890
the artificial light is very condensed,

893
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,410
whereas the outside light is
scattered in the atmosphere,

894
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,450
and so you can think that
you're not getting much sunlight

895
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,080
but you're actually
getting much more outside,

896
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,300
so get outside, get that
sunlight early in the day,

897
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,230
and try and do it on a consistent basis.

898
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,410
If you can't do it every day

899
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,780
or you sleep through this
period of the early day,

900
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,740
low solar angle,

901
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,230
don't worry about it,

902
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,610
these systems in the body,

903
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,140
these hormone systems and
neurotransmitter systems

904
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,650
that make you awake at
certain periods of the day

905
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,900
and sleepy at other times

906
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,610
are operating by averaging

907
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,110
when you view the brightest light.

908
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,900
Now, that can immediately tell us

909
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,700
that what most people
are doing is terrible,

910
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,550
they're waking up and they're
looking at their phone,

911
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,320
which isn't triggering activation
of these cells in the eye

912
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,030
and the central circadian clock,

913
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,110
then a few hours later,

914
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,500
they might get in their car
with sunglasses and drive.

915
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,313
Now, a note about sunglasses
and prescription lenses,

916
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,340
absolutely never, ever,
ever compromise safety

917
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,000
for the sorts of things I'm talking about,

918
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,300
so if you need to wear
sunglasses for safety reasons,

919
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,340
wear them,

920
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,190
absolutely, if you wear
prescription lenses or contacts,

921
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,760
wear them, they won't filter
out the wavelengths of light

922
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,130
that are necessary for
setting these central clocks,

923
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,200
so safety first, of course,

924
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,470
if you have a retinal
degenerative disorder,

925
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,360
retinitis pigmentosa, macular
degeneration, or glaucoma,

926
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,410
or those run in your family,

927
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,700
you want to avoid excessively
bright light all the time,

928
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,340
you wanna be very cautious about that,

929
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,060
you're going to wanna
get your light exposure

930
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,810
through seeing dimmer
light, including sunlight,

931
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,810
but for longer periods of time, perhaps.

932
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,207
You might immediately ask,

933
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,757
"What about low-vision or blind people,

934
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:55,380
"how do they set these central clocks?"

935
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,030
Well, turns out that
low-vision and blind people,

936
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,300
most of them, provided
they still have eyes,

937
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,300
that the eyes weren't removed

938
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,720
because of a burn or a tumor
or something like that,

939
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,800
still maintain these neurons
that set the circadian clock,

940
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,310
which brings me to a
really important point,

941
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,760
it's not about seeing
and perceiving the sun,

942
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,620
this is a subconscious mechanism
by which these neurons,

943
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,900
which are called
melanopsin ganglion cells,

944
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,620
these neurons set your central clocks

945
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,090
by getting activated by the
particular wavelengths of light

946
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,570
that are present in the atmosphere,

947
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,223
even coming through cloud cover,

948
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,210
and you don't need to
see or perceive the sun

949
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,610
in order to get this mechanism to start.

950
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,560
Now, it's such a vitally
important mechanism

951
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,910
because it dictates how well

952
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,310
and what time you will want to
fall asleep later in the day,

953
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,900
so for those of you that are night owls

954
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,157
and you insist that you're a night owl

955
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:51,110
and you have the genetic polymorphism

956
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,110
that makes you a night owl,

957
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,850
you may very well have
that genetic polymorphism,

958
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,930
those genes that make
you want to stay up late

959
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,710
and wake up late,

960
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,400
but chances are, about half of you

961
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,960
that think that you're night owls

962
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,880
are just not getting enough
sunlight early in the day.

963
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,410
So viewing light early in
the day, ideally sunlight,

964
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,530
is key for establishing
healthy sleep-wake rhythms

965
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,460
and for allowing you to
fall asleep easily at night.

966
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,780
Now, it's not gonna make sure

967
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,690
that all that happens every single time,

968
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,057
but it is the foundation of proper sleep

969
00:39:23,057 --> 00:39:25,460
and what we call circadian health,

970
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,640
it governs metabolism
and so many other things

971
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,223
that are supposed to exist
on a regular 24-hour cycle.

972
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,087
Some of you, many of you, might be asking,

973
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,980
"What else can help set this rhythm?"

974
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,520
Well, it turns out that light

975
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,990
is what we call the primary
zeitgeber, the time giver,

976
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,930
but other things can help
establish this rhythm of cortisol

977
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,520
followed by melatonin 12
to 16 hours later as well.

978
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,480
The other things besides light

979
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,960
are timing of food intake,
timing of exercise,

980
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,410
as well as various drugs or
chemicals that one might ingest,

981
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,490
not illegal drugs,

982
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,333
although those will impact
circadian mechanisms as well,

983
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,560
but the reason we focus
so heavily on light

984
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,560
is that light is the main
way that this central clock,

985
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,677
the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
was supposed to be set,

986
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:22,380
and we know that because
it's the only direct input

987
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,480
to the clock.

988
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,590
These neurons in the eye that
are also part of the brain

989
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,760
that we call melanopsin ganglion cells

990
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,290
that, not so incidentally, were discovered

991
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,800
by my friend and colleague David
Berson at Brown University,

992
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,380
and others, Samer Hattar,
King-Wai Yau, et cetera,

993
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,530
worked out the mechanisms,
the molecular mechanisms,

994
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,560
but it was really David Berson

995
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,363
that discovered these
incredibly fascinating,

996
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,570
you know, these are cells that
aren't important for sight

997
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,500
like pattern vision,

998
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,980
but are for setting our clocks,

999
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,090
David's really credited
with making that discovery.

1000
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,640
Those cells are the main way

1001
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,500
and the only direct way to set the clock,

1002
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,070
in fact, it's fair to say

1003
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,700
that light viewed by
these melanopsin cells,

1004
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,630
in particular, sunlight,

1005
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,500
is 1,000 to 10,000 times more effective

1006
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,070
than, say, getting up in
darkness and just exercising.

1007
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,110
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't

1008
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,800
exercise early in the day in darkness

1009
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,070
if that's what you like to do,

1010
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,370
it will have somewhat an effect

1011
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,130
on raising your wakefulness
early in the day

1012
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,620
and setting these rhythms,

1013
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,500
and this is because of
some other pathways,

1014
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,820
for the aficionados out there

1015
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,090
who wanna know more neuroscience,

1016
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,030
here's how it goes, you've got this clock

1017
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,930
above the roof of your mouth

1018
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,720
that churns out this 24-hour rhythm

1019
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,630
and it's communicated
to all the other organs

1020
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,160
and tissues of your body,

1021
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,550
but there's another structure,

1022
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,870
it has a cool name, it's called
the intergeniculate leaflet,

1023
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,350
which sits a few millimeters
away in the brain,

1024
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,580
and it's involved in
regulating the clock output

1025
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:55,680
through what's called non-photic,
non-light-type influences

1026
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,470
like exercise and feeding, et cetera.

1027
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,420
So if you are not feeling
awake during the day

1028
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,210
and you're having trouble sleeping,

1029
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,170
get the sunlight exposure
that we just talked about,

1030
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,180
but in addition to that,

1031
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,540
if you wanna become an
early riser, for instance,

1032
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,660
and you wanna feel more awake

1033
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,200
during the early part of the day,

1034
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,500
by getting that light exposure

1035
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,000
and exercising early in the day,

1036
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,250
you will, after two or three days,

1037
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,690
you will naturally start to
wake up earlier in the day,

1038
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,130
and that's because these
clock mechanisms have shifted,

1039
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,860
it's like setting the clock earlier

1040
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,280
as opposed to delaying the clock,

1041
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,530
and that takes us to a
somewhat complicated,

1042
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,810
but very important, aspect to all this,

1043
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,400
which is, what sets the
clock and keeps it anchored?

1044
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,570
The main thing is that bright
light early in the day,

1045
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:44,500
the other thing is sunset,

1046
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,680
when the sun is also at low solar angle,

1047
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,333
low, close to the horizon,

1048
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:53,520
by viewing sunlight at that
time of day in the evening,

1049
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,410
or afternoon, depending
on what time of year it is

1050
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,340
and where you are in the world,

1051
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,800
these melanopsin cells,
these neurons in your eye,

1052
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,970
signal the central circadian clock

1053
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,090
that it's the end of the day,

1054
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,510
and there's a really nice study

1055
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,940
that was published last year,

1056
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,770
and I will put links to
these references on a website

1057
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,860
not too long from now,

1058
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,780
there was a really nice study that showed

1059
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,910
that viewing sunlight around
the time of the sunset,

1060
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,320
doesn't have to be just
crossing the horizon,

1061
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,470
but circa sunset,

1062
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,273
within an hour or so of sunset,

1063
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,930
prevents some of the bad effects of light

1064
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,860
in preventing melatonin
release later that same night,

1065
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,800
so let me repeat this,

1066
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,330
viewing light early in the day is key,

1067
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,260
viewing light later in the day

1068
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,270
when the sun is setting,
or around that time,

1069
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,290
can help protect these
mechanisms, your brain and body,

1070
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,820
against the negative effects
of light later in the day,

1071
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,290
so let me talk about you would do that,

1072
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,650
you'd go view the sunset

1073
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,920
or you would go outside in
the late afternoon or evening,

1074
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,410
again, if you safely can do that

1075
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,410
with sunglasses off, you will,

1076
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,650
if you need to wear sunglasses, fine,

1077
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,810
but it will take probably
100 to 1,000 times longer

1078
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,160
with dark sunglasses than
if you take them off,

1079
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,680
again, if you wanna do this
through a window at work,

1080
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,080
that's fine, but it'll
take 50 times longer,

1081
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,040
so the best thing to do is

1082
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,020
just to get outside for a few minutes,

1083
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,780
anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes,
also in the afternoon.

1084
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,140
Having those two signals
arriving to your central clock

1085
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,560
that your body, your internal world,

1086
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,770
knows when it's morning and
knows when it's evening,

1087
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,020
is tremendously powerful.

1088
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,030
Maybe think about it this way,

1089
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,090
every cell in your body
needs glucose and energy,

1090
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,230
it needs, whether or not
it gets that from meats

1091
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,760
or it gets it from ketones or
it gets it from carbohydrates

1092
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,510
or fruit or vegetables, it doesn't matter,

1093
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,330
it is eventually converted
into a certain form of energy

1094
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,990
that all your cells use,

1095
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,760
but you don't take glucose,

1096
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,070
you don't take bread or
a steak or a nice orange

1097
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,350
and shove it in your ear,

1098
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,300
you put it in your mouth,

1099
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,150
it goes into your stomach, it's digested,

1100
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,700
and then that resource is distributed

1101
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,530
to all the cells of your body.

1102
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,910
Every cell in your body needs oxygen,

1103
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,650
and you don't put a hose

1104
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,100
you know, through your
nostril or through your ear

1105
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,190
or through some other
orifice in your body,

1106
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,260
you inhale air and it's then
distributed via the lungs

1107
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,350
to the cells in your blood stream,

1108
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,380
and then it's distributed to
all the organs of your body.

1109
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,460
Every cell and organ in your
body needs light information,

1110
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,300
and the way to get that light information

1111
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,200
to all those cells,

1112
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,510
because you have a thick skull

1113
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,230
and the inside of you is
dark inside your skin,

1114
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,810
there's no sunlight getting in there,

1115
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,760
is by viewing sunlight with your eyes

1116
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,550
at the two times of day
that I'm referring to, okay?

1117
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,420
That's the only route.

1118
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,050
There was a study published in "Science,"

1119
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,930
an excellent journal,

1120
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,230
well over 10 years ago,

1121
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,240
that showed that light shone
on the back of the knee

1122
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,180
could set these circadian rhythms,

1123
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,670
that study was retracted,

1124
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,120
and unfortunately, most people don't know

1125
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,410
that it was retracted,

1126
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,990
there were some experimental flaws,

1127
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,450
that people were actually viewing light

1128
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,510
through their eyes.

1129
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,740
That study was repeated,

1130
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,250
turns out, there is no

1131
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,450
extraocular photo reception in humans.

1132
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,690
Whatever somebody tells you

1133
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,470
that light to the skin
or light to the wherever

1134
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,500
is beneficial for your health,

1135
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,700
we can talk about that,

1136
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,760
but there's no way that light information

1137
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,720
is setting your clocks,

1138
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,930
you need these cells in your eyes

1139
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,740
to perceive or to see light

1140
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,060
at the particular times of
day that I'm referring to.

1141
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,100
Some animals, like snakes
and other reptiles,

1142
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,760
actually have a hole in
the top of their skull

1143
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,510
to get light information
directly to their pineal

1144
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,940
to suppress melatonin.

1145
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,000
We don't have that hole,

1146
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,160
I mean, most of you don't
have holes in your skull.

1147
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,720
These holes in your skull

1148
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,340
that we call the sockets for the eyes

1149
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,380
are actually there primarily
to allow light information

1150
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,650
to this central clock,

1151
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,710
and then vision and pattern
vision and color vision

1152
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,580
came much later in evolution,

1153
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,360
we know this on the
basis of genetic studies

1154
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,120
we get to discuss in a future podcast.

1155
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,930
So get that light information

1156
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,060
to the cells of your brain and body

1157
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,450
by viewing sunlight at
the two times of day

1158
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,433
that I referred to.

1159
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,617
There's always a lot of questions about,

1160
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,880
"How long, how much, how do
I know if I've had enough?"

1161
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,900
You'll know because your rhythm

1162
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,200
will start to fall into
some degree of normalcy,

1163
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,080
you'll start to wake up

1164
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,710
at more or less the same time each day,

1165
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,370
you'll fall asleep more easily at night,

1166
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,070
generally, it takes
about two or three days

1167
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,760
for these systems to align,

1168
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,990
so if you've not been
doing these behaviors,

1169
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,230
it's gonna take a few days,

1170
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,330
but they can have tremendous benefits,

1171
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,550
and sometimes rather quickly,

1172
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,320
on a number of different
mental and physical aspects

1173
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,153
of your health.

1174
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,830
Now let's talk about
the bad effects of light

1175
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,340
because light is not supposed
to arrive in our system

1176
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,560
at any time,

1177
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,490
and nowadays, because of
screens and artificial light,

1178
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,580
we have access to light
at times of day and night

1179
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,610
that normally we wouldn't.

1180
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,290
Now, earlier I said that
you need a lot of light,

1181
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,123
in particular, sunlight,

1182
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:56,290
to set these clock mechanisms,

1183
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,110
that's true, but there's a
kind of diabolical feature

1184
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,230
to the way all of this works,

1185
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,943
which is the longer you've been awake,

1186
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,070
the more sensitive your retina
and these cells are to light,

1187
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,830
so that if you've been
awake for 10, 12, 14 hours,

1188
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,760
it becomes very easy for
even a small amount of light

1189
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,490
coming from a screen or
from an overhead light

1190
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,800
to trigger the activation of the clock

1191
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,660
and make you feel like
you wanna stay up later,

1192
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,920
make it harder to fall asleep,

1193
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,350
and disrupt your sleep pattern, okay?

1194
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,620
So the simple way to think about this is

1195
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,280
you want as much light
as is safely possible

1196
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,640
early in the day, morning
and throughout the day,

1197
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,840
including blue light,

1198
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,860
so take those blue
blockers off during the day

1199
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,870
unless you have a real issue
with screen light sensitivity,

1200
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,860
and you want as little
light coming into your eyes,

1201
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,920
artificial or sunlight,

1202
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,610
after, say, 8:00 p.m.,

1203
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,690
and certainly, you do not want to get

1204
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,980
bright light exposure to your eyes

1205
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,080
between 11:00 p.m. and
4:00 a.m., and here's why,

1206
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,160
David Berson, who I mentioned before,

1207
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,320
and another and friend and
colleague, Samer Hattar,

1208
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,050
who's director of the chronobiology unit

1209
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,240
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health

1210
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,790
published a paper in
"Cell," which is a journal,

1211
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,950
another excellent journal,
very high stringency,

1212
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,950
showing that light that
arrives to the eyes

1213
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,880
between 11:00 p.m. and
4:00 a.m., approximately,

1214
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,340
suppresses the release of dopamine,

1215
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,250
this neuromodulator
that makes us feel good,

1216
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,550
and it's sort of an
endogenous antidepressant,

1217
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,040
and can inhibit learning

1218
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,630
and create all sorts of
other detrimental effects,

1219
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,310
it does this through a mechanism,

1220
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,480
for those of you that wanna
know the neural pathways,

1221
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,900
that involves light to the eyes

1222
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,856
that's then signaled to a
structure called the habenula,

1223
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:40,640
the habenula looks like
two little bat ears

1224
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,530
sitting right in the middle
of a structure in your brain

1225
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,550
called the thalamus,

1226
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,650
don't worry about these names

1227
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,720
if you're not interested in this stuff,

1228
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,440
if you are, these are
just avenues to explore,

1229
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,360
when that habenula gets activated

1230
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,130
it's actually called the
disappointment nucleus

1231
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,090
because it actually
makes us feel less happy

1232
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,190
and more disappointed,

1233
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,700
and can lead to certain
forms of depression

1234
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,180
in the wakeful state.

1235
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,460
Now, if you wake up in
the middle of the night

1236
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,460
and you need to use the bathroom

1237
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,770
or you're on an all-night flight

1238
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:10,323
and you're, you know, need to
read or whatever it is, fine,

1239
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,340
every once in a while,
it's not gonna be a problem

1240
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,420
to get bright light exposure to your eyes

1241
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,860
in the middle of the night,

1242
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,530
but if you think about
our lifestyle nowadays

1243
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,140
and being up late looking at phones,

1244
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,820
even if you dim that screen,

1245
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,700
you're triggering this activation

1246
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,160
because your retinal sensitivity

1247
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,310
and the sensitivity of
these neurons has gone up

1248
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,720
late in the day.

1249
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,750
Now, I'm not here to dictate

1250
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,080
what you should or shouldn't do,

1251
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
but for those of you that are

1252
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,300
experiencing challenges with mood,

1253
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,580
those of you that have anxiety,

1254
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,210
learning problems, issues focusing,

1255
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,350
the questions I usually get
are, "How can I focus better?"

1256
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,080
Well, we will get to that,

1257
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,340
but one of the best ways you can support

1258
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,980
your mechanisms for good
mood, mental health,

1259
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,800
learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,

1260
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,670
is to take control of this
light exposure behavior at night

1261
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,780
and not get much or any
bright light exposure

1262
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,950
in the middle of the night.

1263
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,610
Red light won't trigger this pathway,

1264
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,230
but very few people have
the kind of infrared lights

1265
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,957
that are set up, or floor lights,

1266
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:09,170
and that brings me to an important point,

1267
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,690
which is about the location of light,

1268
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,600
this hasn't been discussed
much out there, I don't think,

1269
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,410
these cells in our eye,

1270
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:18,250
these neurons that
signal the central clock,

1271
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,100
reside mostly, not
exclusively, but mostly,

1272
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,180
in the bottom half of our retina,

1273
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,800
and because we have a lens
in front of our retina,

1274
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,870
and because of the optics of lenses,

1275
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,630
that means that these cells

1276
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,000
are actually viewing
our upper visual field,

1277
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,520
there's an inversion of the
visual image, et cetera,

1278
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,170
you can look that up
if you wanna learn more

1279
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,510
about retinal optics, it's fascinating,

1280
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,620
but not the topic for today.

1281
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,950
These cells are in the bottom
half of your retina mostly,

1282
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,950
and so they're viewing the
overhead visual space around you.

1283
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,440
This is probably not
coincidental that these cells

1284
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,970
were essentially designed
to detect sunlight,

1285
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,120
which is overhead, of course,

1286
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,630
so if you want to avoid

1287
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,660
improper activation of these neurons,

1288
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,970
it's better to place lights
that you use in the evening

1289
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,830
low in your physical environment,

1290
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:15,640
so on desktops or even the
floor, if you wanna go that way,

1291
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,980
as opposed to overhead lights,

1292
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,950
so overhead florescent
lights would be the worst,

1293
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,340
that would be the worst case scenario,

1294
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,790
lights that are overhead
that are a little bit softer,

1295
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,040
of the sort or yellow or reddish tints,

1296
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,090
would be slightly better,

1297
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,710
but dim lights that
are set low in the room

1298
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,730
are going to be best

1299
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:36,230
because they aren't going
to activate these neurons

1300
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,160
and therefore shift your circadian clock,

1301
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,570
so that's a goal.

1302
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,610
Some people, like Samer Hattar
that I mentioned earlier,

1303
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,700
he turns his home basically
into a cave in the evenings.

1304
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,120
Candlelight actually does not

1305
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,690
trigger activation of these cells,

1306
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:55,690
so candlelight and fireplaces
and campfires are fine,

1307
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,300
dim lights, very dim lights are fine,

1308
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,050
and lights low in the
physical environment,

1309
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,720
of course, the problem with
candlelight and fireplaces

1310
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,650
is the fire hazard,

1311
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,713
but you're smart people, you
know what to do about that.

1312
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,850
Don't burn down whatever
structure you're in,

1313
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,260
including forests, please.

1314
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,880
So, keep the lights low
in in your environment.

1315
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,010
What if you wake up in
the middle of the night

1316
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:22,733
and you find yourself watching
TV or on the computer?

1317
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:25,800
Well, in that case, you might
wanna wear blue blockers,

1318
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,110
and you certainly would
wanna dim the screen,

1319
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,630
but ideally, you're not doing that,

1320
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,660
it's remarkable the positive effects

1321
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,630
of getting that bit of
sunlight early in the day,

1322
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,220
maybe even also around sunset,

1323
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,090
and avoiding bright lights,

1324
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,560
and especially overhead bright lights,

1325
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,730
between about 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m..

1326
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,470
Now, I'm not talking about shift work,

1327
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:46,070
I'm realizing that we're probably

1328
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,740
gonna have to have an entire discussion

1329
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,410
devoted just to shift workers

1330
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,830
because there's some
good information there

1331
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,740
about how they can protect themselves

1332
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,340
against some of the very bad
health effects of shift work,

1333
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,830
of getting light in the
middle of the night,

1334
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,210
but we rely on shift workers

1335
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,440
and they're super important to culture

1336
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,470
and society and the economy,

1337
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,050
so I wanna acknowledge them

1338
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,010
and let you know that
we will do a discussion

1339
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,060
about shift work and jet lag,

1340
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,350
but let's talk about what light can do

1341
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:17,580
in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.

1342
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,240
So the way to think
about this whole system,

1343
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,980
again, is you've got adenosine building up

1344
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,090
depending on how long you've been awake

1345
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,150
and it's making you sleepy,

1346
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,820
and then you've got the
circadian mechanisms

1347
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,490
that are timing your wakefulness

1348
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,090
and timing when you wanna be asleep,

1349
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,400
mainly through cortisol and melatonin,

1350
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,470
but there are a bunch of other things

1351
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,560
that are downstream of
cortisol and melatonin,

1352
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:40,080
like, we tend to be hungrier
during our wakeful period

1353
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,030
than late at night,

1354
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,800
some people like to eat late at night,

1355
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,390
but if you're finding that you

1356
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:46,820
can't become a day person
or a morning person,

1357
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,010
shifting your light exposure, exercise,

1358
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,950
and food intake to the daytime will help.

1359
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,750
Some people like to stop
eating around 6:00 or 8:00 p.m.

1360
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,930
because of metabolic reasons

1361
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,340
or they're trying to maintain
their weight or lose weight,

1362
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,690
that's actually not supported
so well by the literature,

1363
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,510
the literature around
nutrition essentially says

1364
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,880
that it's best to restrict your feeding

1365
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,120
to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle

1366
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,180
to not be eating around the clock,

1367
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,130
and whether or not that's 4
hours or 8 hours or 16 hours

1368
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,610
is a much lengthier discussion
than we have time for now,

1369
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,557
I would refer you to Satchin Panda's book,

1370
00:55:23,557 --> 00:55:25,610
"The Circadian Code,"
which talks all about that,

1371
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,370
he's an expert, a former colleague of mine

1372
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,740
from the Salk Institute in San Diego,

1373
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,360
you can explore intermittent
and circadian fasting,

1374
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,580
so to speak, through Satchin's literature,

1375
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,413
we'll talk about that,

1376
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:38,450
we might even get Satchin
in here if we're lucky

1377
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:39,860
at some point in the future,

1378
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,370
but you can actually use
light to wake up earlier.

1379
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:46,440
Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues
did a beautiful study

1380
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,440
showing that, if you turn on
the lights before waking up,

1381
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,850
so around 45 minutes to
an hour before waking up,

1382
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,400
even if your eyelids are closed,

1383
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,683
provided you're not under the covers,

1384
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,760
after doing that for a few days,

1385
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,450
that increases your total sleep time

1386
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,420
and shifts forward the time
at which you feel sleepy,

1387
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:10,730
it makes you want to go
to bed earlier each night.

1388
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,210
Now, in a kind of diabolical way,

1389
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,530
they did this with teenagers

1390
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,780
who are notorious for
wanting to wake up late

1391
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,613
and stay up late,

1392
00:56:17,613 --> 00:56:18,770
and what they found was

1393
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,820
bright light flashes,
just turning on the lights

1394
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,170
in their environment, overhead lights,

1395
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,090
because they're trying
to activate this system

1396
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,530
and that's why they're
using overhead lights,

1397
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,140
even through the eyelids,
before these kids woke up,

1398
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,690
then made those kids naturally
wanna go to bed earlier

1399
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,220
and they ended up sleeping longer,

1400
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,230
so that's something you could try,

1401
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,610
you could put your lights on a timer

1402
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:41,020
to go on early in the
day before you wake up,

1403
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,440
you could open your blinds

1404
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,280
so that sunlight is coming through,

1405
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,590
and again, if you curl
up under the covers,

1406
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,320
then it's not gonna reach these neurons,

1407
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,560
but it's remarkable that light

1408
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,250
can actually penetrate the eyelids,

1409
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,470
activate these neurons, and
go to the central clock.

1410
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,960
That study illustrates a
really important principle

1411
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,940
of how you're built,

1412
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,090
which is, you have the capacity

1413
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:05,050
for what are called phase
advances and phase delays,

1414
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,190
and I don't wanna
complicate this too much,

1415
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,640
so the simplest way to think about

1416
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,090
phase advances and phase delays

1417
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,337
is that if you see light late in the day,

1418
00:57:15,337 --> 00:57:17,910
and in particular, in
the middle of the night,

1419
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:22,340
your brain and body, for
reasons that now you understand,

1420
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,430
will think that that's morning light

1421
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,570
even though it's not sunlight

1422
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,150
because you have this
heightened sensitivity,

1423
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,910
and it will phase delay,
it will delay your clock,

1424
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:32,050
it will essentially make
you want to get up later

1425
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,780
and go to sleep later,

1426
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,550
so if you get light exposure
too late in the evening

1427
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,940
or in the middle of the night,

1428
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,280
it's going to make it hard

1429
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,540
to want to wake up that next morning early

1430
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,843
and to go to bed early.

1431
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:49,370
The opposite is also true,
if you wake up early,

1432
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:54,340
say, 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m.,
and get light exposure,

1433
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,300
or even earlier, 4:00 a.m.,
and get light exposure,

1434
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,100
it will phase-advance your clock, okay?

1435
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,620
It's gonna make your
clock think it's earlier

1436
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,400
and you'll wanna wake up earlier,

1437
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,730
so the simple way to think about this

1438
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,870
is if you're having
trouble waking up early

1439
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,690
and feeling alert early in the day,

1440
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,300
you're going to wanna try
and get bright light exposure

1441
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,070
even before waking up because
it will advance your clock,

1442
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:20,220
it's sort of like turning
the clock forward,

1443
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,730
whereas if you are having
trouble waking up early,

1444
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,860
you definitely don't want to get

1445
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,110
too much light exposure
or any light exposure

1446
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,410
to your eyes late in the evening

1447
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,260
and in the middle of the night

1448
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,160
because it's just gonna delay
your clock more and more,

1449
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,460
so rather than get into the specifics

1450
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,720
of everybody's situation

1451
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,070
because there are many of you out there

1452
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,220
with different situations

1453
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,390
and lifestyle requirements, et cetera,

1454
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,000
the way to think about this

1455
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,270
is that you have these internal mechanisms

1456
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,990
of adenosine and circadian clocks,

1457
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,600
and they're always operating,

1458
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,450
and what you're trying to
do is provide them anchors,

1459
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:55,910
you're trying to provide them
consistent, powerful anchors

1460
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,280
so that your cortisol, your melatonin,

1461
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,450
and then everything that
cascades down from that,

1462
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,170
like your metabolism and
your ability to learn

1463
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,260
and your sense of alertness,
your dopamine, your serotonin,

1464
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,620
all that stuff is timed regularly,

1465
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:16,620
one of the reasons why there's
so much challenge out there

1466
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,000
with focus and anxiety and depression,

1467
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,310
there are a lot of reasons for that,

1468
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,420
but one of the reasons is that
people's internal mechanisms

1469
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,680
aren't anchored to anything regular.

1470
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,670
Now, this doesn't require
being neurotically attached

1471
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,180
to getting up at a very
specific time, going outside,

1472
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,270
viewing the sunlight at
the same time every day,

1473
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,810
these systems, again, will average,

1474
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,910
but if you can provide them
consistent light anchors

1475
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,790
early in the day and in the evening,

1476
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,370
and avoiding light at night,

1477
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,740
you will be amazed at
the tremendous number

1478
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,030
of positive effects
that can come from that

1479
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:51,000
at the level of metabolic
factors, hormones,

1480
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,460
and just general feelings of wellbeing,

1481
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,330
in fact, most of us are familiar

1482
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,380
with what it is to not sleep well

1483
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,000
and all the terrible effects that has,

1484
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,370
maybe one night you're
fine, two nights even,

1485
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:06,150
for the new parents out
there, I sympathize with you,

1486
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,570
but most people are not
familiar with what it is

1487
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:13,420
to sleep really, really
well on a consistent basis,

1488
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,180
and when you start doing that

1489
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,040
by controlling your
sleep environment, right,

1490
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,830
get the proper sleep surface,
get the proper pillow,

1491
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,840
get the temperature in the room right,

1492
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,800
get your light exposure right,

1493
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,750
start timing your exercise
at normal periods or times

1494
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,820
throughout the day and week,

1495
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,370
it's amazing how many
other biological systems

1496
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,120
just naturally fall in line,

1497
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,847
and this is why whenever people ask me,

1498
01:00:35,847 --> 01:00:36,800
"What should I take?"

1499
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,427
which is one of the most
common questions I get,

1500
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:39,477
"What supplement should I take?

1501
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:40,647
"What drug should I be taking?

1502
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:42,320
"What things should I be taking?"

1503
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:47,320
The first question I always ask
them is, "How's your sleep?"

1504
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,610
and 90% of the time, they tell me

1505
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,810
they either have trouble
falling asleep or staying asleep

1506
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:54,420
or they don't feel rested
throughout the day.

1507
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,640
A brief note about naps,

1508
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,640
naps, provided that they're
less than one ultradian cycle,

1509
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,580
provided they're 20 minutes
or 30 minutes or even an hour,

1510
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,650
can be very beneficial
for a lot of people,

1511
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,290
you don't have to take them,

1512
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,580
but many people naturally feel a dip

1513
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,660
in energy and focus late in the afternoon,

1514
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,800
in fact, if we were gonna
look at wakefulness,

1515
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,040
what we would find is that you get

1516
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,480
that morning light exposure, hopefully,

1517
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,550
your cortisol goes up, people
will start feeling awake,

1518
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,880
and then around two, or three,
or four in the afternoon,

1519
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,400
there's a spike in everything

1520
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,890
from alertness to ability to learn,

1521
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,460
some metabolic factors drop,

1522
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,590
and then it just naturally comes back up,

1523
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,240
and then it tapers off
as the night goes on.

1524
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,760
So for some of you, naps are great,

1525
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,350
I love taking naps,

1526
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,450
some people, they wake up from
naps feeling really groggy,

1527
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,350
that's probably because
they're not sleeping

1528
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,540
as well as they should at night

1529
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,740
or as long as they should at night,

1530
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,380
and so they're dropping into REM sleep

1531
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,060
or deeper forms of sleep in the day time,

1532
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,290
and then they wake up and
they feel kind of disoriented,

1533
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,900
other people feel great after a nap,

1534
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,360
so that's another case where,
just like with caffeine,

1535
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,010
so sort of have to evaluate for yourself.

1536
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,610
As we discuss this,
you're probably realizing

1537
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:02,700
this is a lot like nutrition
where nowadays it's just crazy,

1538
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,240
I mean, if you go on social media,

1539
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,370
it's like you've got people
who are pushing carnivore,

1540
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,310
you've got other people
who are pushing vegan,

1541
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,070
other people who are pushing paleo,

1542
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,030
every variation of every diet,

1543
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,910
and there's a lot of data to support

1544
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,340
any and all of those and
the arguments go on and on,

1545
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,500
and there's probably a
lot of genetic variation

1546
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,000
and lifestyle variation

1547
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,410
that's going to dictate whether or not

1548
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,270
something is good for you,
whether or not you like it,

1549
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,050
whether or not you'll stick to it.

1550
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,840
The same thing is true for circadian

1551
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,680
and sleep and wakefulness behaviors,

1552
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,390
except the light-viewing behavior

1553
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,370
that I talked about before,
there's no way around that,

1554
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:37,870
that's hardwired into our system,

1555
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:41,230
the same way we could factually say

1556
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,760
that everybody needs some nutrition

1557
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,580
at some level from some source,

1558
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,500
everybody needs light information

1559
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,700
arriving in their system in
some way at regular intervals,

1560
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,080
so that's really what this is about.

1561
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,000
Okay, so naps are gonna
be good for some people,

1562
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,833
not for others,

1563
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:59,280
I have a colleague, a very
accomplished neuroscientist,

1564
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,830
who likes to take naps just after lunch,

1565
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:06,130
I personally like to take a
nap around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m.,

1566
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,390
but there's a practice

1567
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,820
that I've adopted in the last 5 years

1568
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,370
that I've found to be immensely beneficial

1569
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,340
that is sort of like
napping but isn't napping,

1570
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,740
it's a thing that they call yoga nidra,

1571
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,010
yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep,

1572
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,800
and it's a sort of meditation
that you listen to,

1573
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,810
there are number of scripts,

1574
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,450
I've talked about this on podcasts before

1575
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,710
but I'm going to post a link
to the two that I like most,

1576
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:33,620
that allows you to consciously

1577
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,290
bring your entire body and mind

1578
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,140
into a state of deep relaxation,

1579
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,210
and sometimes you fall asleep
and sometimes you don't,

1580
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:46,160
this is done for 10 to 30 or
even 60 minutes at a time.

1581
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,280
The other thing that works
really well is meditation,

1582
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,150
so I'm talking about naps,

1583
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,700
but I'm also talking about yoga nidra,

1584
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,510
which is sort of a form of meditation,

1585
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,490
and then more standard
forms of meditation,

1586
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,170
all three of those do something powerful

1587
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,240
which is that they bring our mind

1588
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,060
into a state of less so-called

1589
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,030
sympathetic nervous system activation,

1590
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,720
go back and listen to episode one

1591
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,880
if that doesn't make any sense,

1592
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,620
which is what governs your alertness,

1593
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:14,480
and instead, it activates
cells and circuits in your body

1594
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,970
that promote the
parasympathetic nervous system,

1595
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,710
or the calming system.

1596
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:20,920
A lot of people are
not good falling asleep

1597
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,830
because they're not good at calming down,

1598
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,200
so some people have no
trouble falling asleep,

1599
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,620
but many people have a
hard time falling asleep,

1600
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,310
or at least every once in a while

1601
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,310
experience challenges falling asleep.

1602
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:35,080
I don't have problems
falling asleep most nights,

1603
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,130
but I've noticed that
if I'm working very hard

1604
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:39,040
or if the world is particularly stressful,

1605
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,410
my mind gets into a bit
of a kind of OCD loop

1606
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,850
where I tend to ruminate on things,

1607
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,513
and I'm not even thinking
about anything in particular,

1608
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:48,240
it's just challenging for me
to disengage and fall asleep.

1609
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,630
Meditation and yoga nidra scripts

1610
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,580
have been immensely helpful for me

1611
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,920
in terms of accelerating
the transition to sleep,

1612
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,770
so they involve taking a few minutes,

1613
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,070
10 to 30 minutes or so,

1614
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,510
just like you would for a nap,

1615
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,540
and just listening to a
script, almost passively,

1616
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:07,730
and it has you do some
particular patterns of breathing

1617
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,620
and some other kind of
body-scan-like things

1618
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:13,150
that can really help
people learn to relax,

1619
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:14,680
not just in that moment,

1620
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,520
but get better at relaxing
and turning off thinking

1621
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,720
in order to fall asleep when
they wanna do that at night.

1622
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,360
There's another thing
that's similar to this,

1623
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,040
which is certain forms
of hypnosis for sleep,

1624
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,870
for that, I'll just
refer you to the website

1625
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,960
of a colleague and collaborator of mine,

1626
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,270
David Spiegel, who's our associate chair

1627
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:35,580
of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences at Stanford,

1628
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,150
he's developed a website,

1629
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,870
which is reverie,
R-E-V-E-R-I-E, health.com,

1630
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,620
so reveriehealth.com,

1631
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,310
that has a lot of science-supported,

1632
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:49,380
clinically supported hypnosis scripts

1633
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,730
that essentially take the brain

1634
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:53,150
into states of deep relaxation

1635
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,870
for the sake of rewiring the
brain and neuroplasticity,

1636
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,430
but one of those scripts that's there

1637
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,930
and is available free is for sleep,

1638
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,970
and we'll talk more about
hypnosis at a later time

1639
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:04,320
because it has a ton of other effects

1640
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,223
that aren't just limited to sleep.

1641
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,370
So a period of time each day

1642
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:10,990
that you devote to getting better

1643
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:12,450
at falling and staying asleep

1644
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,130
is actually a really
good practice to adopt.

1645
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,600
The other thing about these practices

1646
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,800
like meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis,

1647
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,167
is people would always say to me,

1648
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,210
"Well, when should I do them?"

1649
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,077
and I always say, "Well, the
best time of day to do it

1650
01:06:24,077 --> 01:06:26,027
"is when you first wake up in the morning,

1651
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:28,407
"provided you've gotten
your sunlight already,

1652
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:30,017
"anytime you wake up in
the middle of the night,

1653
01:06:30,017 --> 01:06:30,960
"or any time of day."

1654
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,890
In other words, they're
always good for you

1655
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,510
because it's a training mechanism

1656
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:36,770
by which you self-train
your nervous system

1657
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:39,310
to go from a state of heightened alertness

1658
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:40,270
that you don't want

1659
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:43,450
to heightened relaxation that you do want,

1660
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,330
and so it's really teaching
you to hit the brake,

1661
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,990
and that brings us to an even
more important point, perhaps,

1662
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,550
which is, we've all experienced

1663
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,420
that we can stay up if we want to, right?

1664
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,920
If we wanna stay up late on New Year's

1665
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,280
or we wanna push an all-nighter,

1666
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,830
some people can do that
more easily than others,

1667
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,380
but we're all capable of doing that,

1668
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,900
but it's very hard to make
ourselves fall asleep,

1669
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,720
and so there's a sort of asymmetry

1670
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,660
to the way our autonomic nervous system,

1671
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,860
which governs this
alertness-calmness thing,

1672
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,350
the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system,

1673
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,610
there's an asymmetry there

1674
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,500
where we are more easily
able to engage wakefulness

1675
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,520
and drive wakefulness,

1676
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,710
we can force ourselves to stay awake,

1677
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:26,370
than we are able to force
ourselves to fall asleep,

1678
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:29,350
and one of the things that
I say over and over again,

1679
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,520
and I'm gonna continue to
say over and over again,

1680
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,480
is it's very hard to control
the mind with the mind,

1681
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,300
when you have trouble falling asleep,

1682
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,280
you need to look to some
mechanism that involves the body,

1683
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,670
and all the things I described,

1684
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,490
meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra,

1685
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,760
all involve exhale-emphasized breathing,

1686
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,780
certain ways of lying down
and controlling the body,

1687
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,060
we're gonna get into
breathing in real depth

1688
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:53,110
at another time,

1689
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,620
but all of those involve using
the body to control the mind

1690
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,960
rather than trying to, you know,

1691
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,640
wrestle your mind into a
certain pattern of relaxation,

1692
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,640
so earlier in episode one, I
talked about the Mobius strip,

1693
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:11,240
this continuous loop that is
the brain-body relationship,

1694
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,050
or the mind-body relationship,

1695
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,150
and when we're having
trouble controlling the mind,

1696
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,660
I encourage people to
look towards the body,

1697
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,020
look toward sunlight,

1698
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,760
avoid sunlight and bright light

1699
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,620
if that happens to be late at night,

1700
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,800
so there's a theme
that's starting to emerge

1701
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,170
which is, in order to control this thing

1702
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,550
that we call the nervous system,

1703
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,000
we have to look back to

1704
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,660
some of the things we discussed earlier,

1705
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,000
like sensation, perception, et cetera,

1706
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,170
but we have to ask, what can we control?

1707
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:37,800
Well, I'm talking about
controlling light exposure,

1708
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,040
controlling your breathing and body,

1709
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,500
I'm not going into details right now

1710
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,170
but you can see the yoga nidra script

1711
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:45,200
or the reveriehealth.com,

1712
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,930
or Headspace would be a great place

1713
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:49,439
to adopt a meditation practice,

1714
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,049
any of those are really teaching you

1715
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,319
to use your body to control your mind,

1716
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:56,209
and to allow you to explore
the mind-body relationship

1717
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,479
in a way that gives you more control

1718
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,359
over your mind and the
mind-body relationship, okay?

1719
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:04,649
So we talked about light,

1720
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:06,979
we talked about activity
and timing of light,

1721
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:09,199
we talked about the usefulness of naps,

1722
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,420
and these things that I'm
calling non-sleep deep rest,

1723
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,880
which include meditation,
yoga nidra, and hypnosis,

1724
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,680
non-sleep deep rest,

1725
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,170
or what I, hereafter, we
will refer to as NSDR,

1726
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,010
not to be confused with EMDR,

1727
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,729
I don't think I've ever heard NSDR,

1728
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:31,729
so I'm planting a flag for
NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

1729
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,330
as a way to reset one's
ability to be awake

1730
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:38,130
after you emerge from NSDR,

1731
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,620
so to get some more wakefulness
and ability to attend,

1732
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:43,560
some emotional stability, reset,

1733
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,680
as well as make it better
and easier to fall asleep

1734
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,490
when you wanna go to sleep at night.

1735
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,029
Now, the non-sleep deep rest

1736
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:53,179
does have some research to support it,

1737
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,970
there's a beautiful study done

1738
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:56,970
out of a university in Denmark,

1739
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,700
I will later provide a link to that study,

1740
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,410
that showed that this meditation

1741
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:05,250
and yoga nidra-type meditation

1742
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,140
allows dopamine and other neuromodulators

1743
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,790
in an area of the brain
called the striatum

1744
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:13,040
that's involved in motor
planning and motor execution,

1745
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,410
to reset itself,

1746
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,890
in other words, this NSDR
can reset our ability

1747
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,580
to engage in the world in a
way that's very deliberate,

1748
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,990
and not to throw in another acronym,

1749
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,240
but NSDR resets your
ability to engage in DPOs,

1750
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,850
duration, path, and outcome,

1751
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,397
so now you're probably
rolling your eyes like,

1752
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:30,940
"Oh my goodness, the number of acronyms,"

1753
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:35,940
but just bear with me
because NSDR is so powerful,

1754
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:39,290
because first of all, it doesn't require

1755
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:41,380
that you rig yourself to any device,

1756
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,450
it doesn't require that you
take much time out of your day,

1757
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:47,830
it doesn't require that you
ingest anything, except air,

1758
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:51,280
and it can have so many positive effects

1759
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,450
right down to the neuromodulator level,

1760
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,910
so I think in the years to come,

1761
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,270
my lab's exploring this

1762
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,460
in a collaboration with
David Spiegel's lab,

1763
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,713
but other labs are
looking at this as well,

1764
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:04,080
I think NSDR is going to start
to play a more prominent role

1765
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,150
in what we call wellness and health,

1766
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:07,570
both mental health and physical health,

1767
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:09,960
so I encourage you to
explore those practices.

1768
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,410
Okay, so what about things that we can

1769
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:14,370
and maybe should or should not take

1770
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,640
in order to control
and access better sleep

1771
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,900
and better wakefulness?

1772
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,870
We've talked about things
you can do or not do,

1773
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:26,290
we've talked about nutrition
and the timing of nutrition,

1774
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,700
now let's talk about compounds,

1775
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,130
those could be prescription drugs,

1776
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,860
those could be supplements,

1777
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:31,920
there are a number of different things

1778
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,100
that will affect your
circadian timing and behavior,

1779
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:40,480
in fact, almost everything
that you could take

1780
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:44,060
will affect your circadian
timing and behavior,

1781
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:44,893
that's right.

1782
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:47,510
So years ago when I
was in graduate school,

1783
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:49,490
I had a professor, unfortunately,
he passed away now,

1784
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,170
but his name was Ted Jones,
the late Edward Jones,

1785
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,940
who was a world-class neuroanatomist,

1786
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,170
he wrote the book on the thalamus,

1787
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,640
in fact, it's called "The Thalamus,"

1788
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,470
and an expert on patterns
of activation in the brain

1789
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,520
during sleep,

1790
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,020
and I'll never forget that
during one of these lectures,

1791
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,237
someone asked Ted the question,

1792
01:12:06,237 --> 01:12:08,247
"What is the effect of some drug

1793
01:12:08,247 --> 01:12:11,340
"on these waves of activity in
the thalamus?" or something,

1794
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,430
and his answer was incredible.

1795
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,440
Now, he was a pretty gruff guy,

1796
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,230
and so his answer was delivered

1797
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,510
in the form of a kind of
aggressive direct statement,

1798
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,407
he said, "A drug is a substance

1799
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:24,407
"that when injected into a person,

1800
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:26,960
"produces a scientific publication,"

1801
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,840
and what he was saying
is actually quite true,

1802
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,890
which is that most every compound

1803
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,210
will have some effect on
some aspect of biology,

1804
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,043
this is why it's hard

1805
01:12:37,043 --> 01:12:38,640
to sort through everything
that's on PubMed,

1806
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,550
if you put any molecule or
compound or drug into PubMed

1807
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:47,160
and then you put sleep next to
it, or alertness next to it,

1808
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,940
you're likely to find a paper
where there's an effect,

1809
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:53,410
but that's not necessarily telling you

1810
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,850
that that drug is helpful for that,

1811
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:56,870
what it's telling you is

1812
01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:00,560
that anytime you change what you take

1813
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,740
or you stop taking something,

1814
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,270
say you're taking sleeping
pills, Ambien or whatever it is,

1815
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,250
and you stop taking them,

1816
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,780
your sleep behavior will change.

1817
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,707
Let's stay you take an aspirin

1818
01:13:09,707 --> 01:13:11,160
and you don't normally take aspirin,

1819
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,320
you will shift your circadian rhythm,

1820
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,240
now you might not shift it perceptibly,

1821
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,140
you might not create
problems for yourself,

1822
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,850
but anytime you ingest a
compound at high potency,

1823
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:24,140
you're going to provide some
shift to your circadian rhythm.

1824
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,020
Now, that said, there are a couple things

1825
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,240
that are directly in line with the biology

1826
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,950
related to falling and staying asleep

1827
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:32,950
and directly in line with
the biology of wakefulness,

1828
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,790
there's a whole category of things,

1829
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,800
like stimulants, cocaine, amphetamine,

1830
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,640
and prescription stimulants, that are,

1831
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,100
the prescription ones were designed

1832
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,490
for the treatment of narcolepsy,

1833
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:46,770
so things like modafinil or armodafinil

1834
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,180
that are designed to created wakefulness,

1835
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:52,710
they are all essentially chemical variants

1836
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,630
of things that increase
epinephrine and dopamine.

1837
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:58,130
Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint

1838
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,650
that things like cocaine and amphetamine

1839
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,180
are just across the board bad,

1840
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:04,090
they have so many addictive
and terrible effects,

1841
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:08,100
in the proper setting prescribed
by the proper professional,

1842
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,340
things like modafinil for
narcolepsy might be appropriate,

1843
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,610
I know that a lot of people
out there take Adderall,

1844
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:18,100
even though they haven't
been prescribed Adderall,

1845
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,410
in order to increase wakefulness,

1846
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:24,060
that is essentially, well,
it's illegal for one,

1847
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,150
but also it's abusing the system

1848
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:27,530
in the sense that you're pushing back

1849
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,470
on the adenosine system
slightly differently

1850
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:31,140
than you do caffeine,

1851
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,370
it will make you feel more alert,

1852
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,600
there tends to be a heavy rebound

1853
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,370
and they do have an addictive potential,

1854
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,950
there are also some other effects of those

1855
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:37,783
that could be quite bad,

1856
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:40,070
so we're gonna explore stimulants

1857
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,870
in a whole month related to drugs,

1858
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:44,270
but there are some supplements

1859
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:48,330
and some things that are
safer, certainly safer,

1860
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,920
and that, in cases where you're

1861
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,250
doing all the right behaviors,

1862
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,770
you're exercising and eating correctly

1863
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,470
and you're still having
trouble with sleep,

1864
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,070
that can be beneficial for
falling and staying asleep.

1865
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,570
Now, I wanna be very clear,
I am not pushing supplements,

1866
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:04,800
I am just pointing you toward some things

1867
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,370
that have been shown in
peer-reviewed studies

1868
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,420
to have some benefit.

1869
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:11,870
The first one is magnesium,

1870
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:13,390
there are many forms of magnesium,

1871
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,770
but certain forms of magnesium

1872
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:17,610
can have positive effects on sleepiness

1873
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:18,900
and the ability to stay asleep,

1874
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:23,660
mainly by way of increasing
neurotransmitters like GABA

1875
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,820
which help turn off the DPO,

1876
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,290
the kind of thinking about the future,

1877
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,910
duration-path-outcome analysis,

1878
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:34,910
and make one's mind kind
of drift in space and time

1879
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,740
and make it easier to fall asleep,

1880
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,520
there are a lot of forms
of magnesium out there,

1881
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,520
but in particular is magnesium
threonate, T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,

1882
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:47,320
which you have to check to
see if this is right for you,

1883
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,460
check with your doctor,

1884
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,010
but magnesium threonate is

1885
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:52,390
associated with transporters in the body

1886
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:54,530
that bring more of it into cells

1887
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,370
that allow people to feel
this kind of drowsiness

1888
01:15:57,370 --> 01:15:58,420
and help them fall asleep,

1889
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,140
so I personally, I can only
talk about what I personally do,

1890
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:04,870
I personally take 3 or 400
milligrams of magnesium threonate

1891
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:07,420
about 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,

1892
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,870
and it helps me fall asleep.

1893
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:13,370
The other thing is theanine, T-H-E-A,

1894
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:17,792
T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,

1895
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:20,160
100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me,

1896
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,000
also helps me turn off
my mind and fall asleep,

1897
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,980
I take it 30 to 60 minutes
throughout the day.

1898
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,380
Interestingly, theanine
is now being introduced

1899
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:29,350
to a lot of energy drinks

1900
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,560
in order to take away the jitters

1901
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,940
that are associated with
drinking too much caffeine

1902
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:36,150
or with some other things
that are in the energy drinks,

1903
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:39,160
energy drinks can be problematic,

1904
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,830
they can contain a lot of L-taurine,

1905
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,820
I'll just tell you an anecdote,

1906
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,653
when I was a postdoc,

1907
01:16:43,653 --> 01:16:45,670
I was drinking a lot of a
particular energy drink,

1908
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,870
it has a lot of taurine in it,

1909
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,130
and actually the whites of my eyes,

1910
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:52,210
the sclera, as it's called,

1911
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:54,480
of my eyes turned beet red,

1912
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,710
and I went to a friend
who's an ophthalmologist,

1913
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,727
I said, "Look, I'm not a marijuana smoker,

1914
01:16:59,727 --> 01:17:00,847
"I haven't been hit on the head,

1915
01:17:00,847 --> 01:17:02,070
"I don't know what's going on,"

1916
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,017
and he looked and he said,

1917
01:17:03,017 --> 01:17:06,420
"I think you've got some
microvascular damage,"

1918
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,440
and we walked through what
I was taking and doing,

1919
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,387
and he said, "Oh, it's
probably the taurine,

1920
01:17:10,387 --> 01:17:11,527
"excessive levels of taurine

1921
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:13,930
"can create some microvascular damage."

1922
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:15,960
So if you're having
microvascular damage in your eye,

1923
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,440
you probably have microvascular damage

1924
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,770
deeper in your skull, so I stopped,

1925
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,760
that's the reason why I
don't take energy drinks,

1926
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,990
so just a consideration,

1927
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,940
again, I'm not here to tell
you what to do or not do,

1928
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,143
but just wanna arm you with information.

1929
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:33,030
The thing about theanine and magnesium

1930
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:35,440
is taken together, they
do, for some people,

1931
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,240
they can make them so
sleepy and sleep so deeply

1932
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,010
that they actually have trouble
waking up in the morning,

1933
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,170
so you have to play with
these things and titrate them

1934
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:43,270
if you decide to use them,

1935
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:44,830
again, if you decide to go this route,

1936
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:47,110
I would not start by taking supplements,

1937
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:48,120
I would start by getting your

1938
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,470
light-viewing behavior correct,

1939
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:52,030
and then think about your nutrition

1940
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,330
and then think about your activity

1941
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:55,800
and then think about whether
or not you wanna supplement,

1942
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,900
we already talked about melatonin earlier.

1943
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,860
There's another supplement
that could be quite useful,

1944
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:03,740
which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,

1945
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,710
which is a derivative of chamomile,

1946
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:10,050
50 milligrams of apigenin
also can augment or support

1947
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:13,200
this kind of creation of a sleepiness

1948
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,440
to help fall asleep and stay asleep.

1949
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,160
A note about sleepwalkers and
people with very vivid dreams,

1950
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,740
theanine can often make
your dreams very vivid,

1951
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:24,460
sleepwalkers should be
careful about taking theanine,

1952
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,840
everyone should be careful
about taking anything,

1953
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,830
and don't take anything

1954
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,240
without consulting your
board-certified M.D.

1955
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,150
or healthcare professional first, okay?

1956
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,760
Your health is your responsibility,

1957
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,140
I am not gonna take responsibility

1958
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:38,780
for what you decide to do
experimentally in any case,

1959
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,680
but especially as it relates
to supplementation and drugs.

1960
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,900
As a important point, apigenin

1961
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,600
is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor,

1962
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,320
so women who want to keep
their estrogen levels high,

1963
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,270
or at whatever levels
they happen to be at,

1964
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,760
should probably avoid apigenin altogether,

1965
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,360
and men, take that into
consideration as well,

1966
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,620
men need estrogen also,

1967
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,980
you don't wanna completely
eliminate your estrogen,

1968
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:05,680
that it can create all
sorts of bad effects

1969
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,270
on libido and cognition, et cetera,

1970
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:10,290
so apigenin in some people

1971
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,120
is gonna be a pretty
strong estrogen inhibitor,

1972
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,663
so keep that in mind.

1973
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:15,870
There are other things you can take

1974
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,500
to help you sleep better,

1975
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,260
those are the legal ones
that, at least I'm aware of,

1976
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,790
have pretty broad safety margins,

1977
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,080
but again, you need to explore

1978
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,363
your safety margins with any compound.

1979
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,190
I think a great website

1980
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,820
that I can refer you to is examine.com,

1981
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:33,670
examine, the word, just as it
sounds, .com, is a website,

1982
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,100
I have no relation to them,

1983
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,680
but there, you can find links
to peer-reviewed studies

1984
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,190
for any compound or supplement,

1985
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,850
as well as some important warnings

1986
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:43,410
related to the things I discussed,

1987
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:44,900
as well as any other thing

1988
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,550
that you might decide to supplement with

1989
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:49,563
or ingest to help improve your sleep.

1990
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,150
Okay, that was a lot of information

1991
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:55,850
about how to get better at sleeping,

1992
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,763
falling asleep, wakefulness, et cetera.

1993
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,790
An important feature of
this podcast, as you know,

1994
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,350
is that we dive deep into topics

1995
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,460
for several episodes at a time,

1996
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,370
at least a month at a time,

1997
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,110
so by stopping here, I recognize

1998
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,570
that there are probably
many more questions

1999
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:13,820
that you still have,

2000
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:15,530
and the great thing about that

2001
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:18,090
is that we have another
episode coming up soon,

2002
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:21,270
I'm going to hold office hours
where I'm going to answer

2003
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:24,560
your specific questions
about episodes one and two,

2004
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,830
so if you have questions
about this episode,

2005
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:28,340
you have questions about episode one,

2006
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,970
write them down, put them in the comments,

2007
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:32,480
I'll also do a post on Instagram

2008
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,590
where you can put them
in the comments there,

2009
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:38,840
but put them in the comments
to this episode as well,

2010
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,970
please recommend the
podcast if you like it,

2011
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,350
please subscribe to it here on YouTube,

2012
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:46,470
please subscribe to it on Apple,

2013
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:48,370
we're now on Spotify as well,

2014
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:49,900
recommend it to a friend,

2015
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,090
the community that we're creating here

2016
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,140
around these topics of
sleep and wakefulness

2017
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,540
and other neuroscience-
and health-related themes

2018
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:00,050
is best supported by your
involvement and your questions,

2019
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:02,180
and so I'm going to be
reading all of your questions,

2020
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:05,620
distilling those into the
most commonly asked questions

2021
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:06,800
and liked questions,

2022
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,880
so if you see something below

2023
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,770
that you are particularly interested in,

2024
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,603
you don't have to put
that question in again,

2025
01:21:10,603 --> 01:21:13,810
you can just give it a like,
the little thumbs-up tab,

2026
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:17,810
and if you're listening to
this on Spotify or Apple,

2027
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,980
please go to YouTube, subscribe,

2028
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:20,970
and put your question there,

2029
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:23,080
or check out the Huberman Lab Instagram

2030
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,650
and you can put your questions there

2031
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:27,140
so that next episode, I
can answer those questions

2032
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,600
and then we can move forward

2033
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,240
even more deeply into
these critical topics

2034
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,680
around sleep and wakefulness

2035
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,850
so that you can be armed
with all the information

2036
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,250
and resources that you need.

2037
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:38,860
Last but not least, a number of you

2038
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,110
have very graciously asked how
you can support the podcast,

2039
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:43,560
the best way to support the podcast

2040
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,850
is to subscribe on YouTube or
one of the other platforms,

2041
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:49,840
we are now on Spotify and Apple,

2042
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,980
and the other way you can
really support the podcast

2043
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,550
is to check out our sponsors,

2044
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,250
which were discussed at the beginning.

2045
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,210
So thank you so much for
your time and attention,

2046
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,853
and above all, thank you for
your interest in science.

2047
