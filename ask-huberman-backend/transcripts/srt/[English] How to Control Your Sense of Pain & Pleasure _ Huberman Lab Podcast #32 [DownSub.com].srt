00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,290
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,878
for everyday life.

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:09,490
[bright upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,580
- I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,070
and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,260
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,710
Today, we continue our
discussion of the senses.

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,930
And the senses we are going to discuss

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,530
are pain and pleasure.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,410
Pain and pleasure reflect two
opposite ends of a continuum,

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,229
a continuum that involves
detection of things in our skin

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,780
and the perception, the understanding

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,310
of what those events are.

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,490
Our skin is our largest sensory organ

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,650
and our largest organ indeed.

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,210
It is much larger than any of
the other organs in our body.

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,360
And it's an odd organ
if you think about it,

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,200
it has so many functions.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,197
It acts as a barrier between our organs

21
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,230
and the outside world,

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,210
it harbors neurons nerve
cells that allow us

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,440
to detect things like
light touch, or temperature

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,900
or pressure of various kinds.

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,890
And it's an organ that
we hang ornaments on.

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,230
People put earrings in their ears.

27
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,330
People decorate their
skin with tattoos and inks

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,760
and other things.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,940
And it's an organ that
allows us to experience

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,760
either great pain or great pleasure.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,800
So it's a multifaceted organ and it's one

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,030
that our brain needs to make
sense of in a multifaceted way.

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,596
So today we're going to discuss all that.

34
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:34,550
And most importantly, how you
can experience more pleasure

35
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,550
and less pain by
understanding these pathways.

36
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,200
We will also discuss things you can do,

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,800
and if you wish things you can take

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,740
that will allow you to
experience more pleasure

39
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,210
and less pain in response

40
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,010
to a variety of different experiences.

41
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,330
Before I go any further,

42
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,810
I want to highlight a particularly
exciting area of science

43
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,643
that relates to the skin and to sensing

44
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:58,620
of pleasure and pain,

45
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,040
but has everything to do with motivation.

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,570
Motivation is something that
many people struggle with,

47
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,300
not everybody, but most
people experience dips

48
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,460
and peaks in their motivation

49
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,370
even if they really want something.

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,930
How should we think about
these changes in motivation?

51
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,550
What do they reflect?

52
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,360
Well at a very basic level,
they reflect fluctuations

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,240
changes in the levels of a
chemical called dopamine.

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,460
Most of us have heard of dopamine.

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,510
Dopamine is a neuromodulator
meaning it modulates

56
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,430
or changes the way that
neurons nerve cells work.

57
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,590
Most of us have heard that dopamine

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,840
is the molecule of pleasure.

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,900
However, that is incorrect.

60
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,693
Dopamine is a molecule of
motivation and anticipation.

61
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,770
To illustrate how dopamine works,

62
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,220
I want to highlight
some very important work

63
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,430
largely carried out by the laboratory

64
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,400
of a guy named Wolfram Schultz.

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,093
The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens

66
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:03,100
of excellent experiments
on the dopamine system

67
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,770
and have identified something called

68
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,380
reward prediction error.

69
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,880
Although in some sense
you can think about it

70
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,110
as reward prediction variance.

71
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,500
Changes in the levels
of dopamine depending

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,960
on whether or not you expect a reward

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,710
and whether or not you get the reward.

74
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,460
So I'm going to make this very simple.

75
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,410
Dopamine is released
into the brain and body

76
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,220
and generally makes us feel
activated and motivated,

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,410
as if we have energy to pursue a goal.

78
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,830
And it is released into the brain and body

79
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,420
in anticipation of a reward.

80
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,080
Measurements of dopamine have been made

81
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,480
in animals and humans.

82
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,920
And what you find is that
when we anticipate a reward,

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,680
dopamine is released,

84
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,330
we will put in the work
to achieve that reward.

85
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,770
That work could be mental
work or physical work,

86
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,490
but when the reward arrives,

87
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,350
dopamine levels drop
back down to baseline.

88
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,183
That's right.

89
00:03:58,183 --> 00:03:59,230
When we receive a reward,

90
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,500
dopamine levels go back down to baseline.

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,190
So the way to envision this
as you can just imagine

92
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,040
a sort of increase in dopamine
as we anticipate something

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,690
we're working towards it,
we're working towards a goal.

94
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,480
We're excited about seeing
somebody or meeting somebody

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,579
or receiving some reward
and then the reward comes

96
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,569
and dopamine goes down.

97
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,063
Now that's all fine and good,

98
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,450
but there is a way to
get much more dopamine

99
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,340
out of that process and therefore a way

100
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,310
to have much more
motivation, energy, and focus

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,420
because those are the
consequences of elevated dopamine.

102
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,040
The way to do that is to
not deliver the reward

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,120
on an expected schedule.

104
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,610
So experiments have been done
where there's an anticipation

105
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,160
of a reward, there's work,

106
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,970
and then the reward
only arrives every other

107
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,324
or every third about of work, okay?

108
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,630
So this would be like
getting a pat on the head.

109
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,970
If you're a dog or a,
perhaps a child or an adult,

110
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,950
or getting a monetary reward
only for every third project

111
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,550
or every third race that you win.

112
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,810
Pick any kind of goal.

113
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,643
It doesn't matter.

114
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,630
These molecules don't care
about what you're pursuing.

115
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,760
They are a common currency of
different types of activities.

116
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,190
That's a regular reward schedule,

117
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,727
and it will not alter the
pattern of dopamine release

118
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,700
that I described before.

119
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,460
However, if the reward
arrives intermittently

120
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,340
almost randomly, so
you anticipate a reward

121
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,740
as a maybe it might come, it might come.

122
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,940
Then you work, work, work,
work, work, no reward.

123
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,270
You repeat the work, work,
work, work, work, work,

124
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,310
and then you get a reward.

125
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,620
So some trials, you do
some trials, you don't,

126
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,190
and it's completely random.

127
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,670
Under those conditions, the amplitude,

128
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,560
the amount of dopamine that's
released into your system

129
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,890
and the motivation to
continue working hard

130
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,500
or playing whatever kind
of game you're playing,

131
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,180
doubles or triples.

132
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,330
And this is the basis of
things like slot machines

133
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,163
and gambling.

134
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,680
And this is why so many
people will give so much

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,680
of their money up to casinos
and the casinos always win.

136
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,670
Sometimes people walk away with more money

137
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,400
than they came to the casino with,

138
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,750
but the vast majority of the time,

139
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,570
the house wins as they say.

140
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,130
And it's because they understand

141
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,610
intermittent reward schedules.

142
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,080
And you can apply this to stay motivated

143
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,120
in your own pursuits.

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,500
Rather than thinking about
the pleasure of a reward,

145
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,130
understand that dopamine
is released in response

146
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,130
to anticipation reward, and
that is the fuel for work.

147
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,010
And every once in awhile at
random remove the reward.

148
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,100
That's the way to continue
to stay motivated.

149
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,500
Not to reward every action or every goal.

150
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
And this is also true,

151
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,700
if you're trying to train up
children or train up players

152
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,280
on a team, you should
not celebrate every win.

153
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,920
I know that's a little counter-intuitive,

154
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,730
we're going to go more into
the biology of dopamine

155
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,680
and how it relates to the pleasure system

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,150
later on in the podcast,

157
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,080
but for now understand
intermittent reward schedules

158
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,840
harness the biology of dopamine
in ways that can allow you

159
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,490
essentially infinite motivation over time.

160
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,570
Before I go any further,

161
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,387
I want to acknowledge that
this podcast is separate

162
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:18,090
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

163
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,190
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

164
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,570
to bring zero cost to consumer information

165
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,750
about science and science-related tools

166
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,200
to the general public.

167
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,740
In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors

168
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,400
of today's podcast.

169
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,311
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

170
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:35,860
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

171
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,490
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

172
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,330
to help you better understand your body

173
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,600
and help you reach your health goals.

174
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,270
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

175
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,920
for the simple reason that
many, if not all of the factors

176
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,340
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

177
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,230
can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.

178
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,480
And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
you can get further
knowledge into the mechanisms

180
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,040
that are going on in your body

181
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,900
and how those mechanisms are changing

182
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,230
as they relate to metabolism and hormones

183
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,270
and other aspects that
profoundly impact your wellbeing.

184
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,230
The problem with most
blood tests, however,

185
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,783
is that you get information
back and it will tell you

186
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,680
whether or not your levels
of something are higher, low,

187
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,900
or within range, but it doesn't
give you any directives.

188
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,450
It doesn't tell you what to
do with that information.

189
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,490
With InsideTracker has
this wonderful feature.

190
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,880
It's a very easy to use
dashboard that has suggestions

191
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,780
about lifestyle factors, exercise,

192
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,660
nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,

193
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,740
that one could take in order
to adjust those numbers

194
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,549
according to your personal goals.

195
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,979
So the whole thing is made very easy.

196
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,919
In fact, they can come to
your home to do the blood test

197
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,779
and DNA test if you like.

198
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,520
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

199
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,940

and through August 15th, you
can get a free inner age test.

211
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,310
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

212
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,150
Helix makes mattresses and pillows

213
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,140
that are ideally suited
to your sleep needs.

214
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,210
Everybody's different.

215
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,610
Some people sleep on their sides,

216
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,750
some people sleep on their stomach,

217
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,200
some people sleep on their back,

218
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,760
some people run warm during the night,

219
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,210
some people run cold.

220
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,850
If you go to the Helix's
website, helixsleep.com,

221
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,030
you can take a quick two-minute quiz,

222
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,670
and then it will tell you
what your ideal mattress is.

223
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,250
It will match you to your ideal mattress.

224
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,860
I did this and I matched to
the so-called Dusk mattress.

225
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,040
I like a mattress that's
not too firm nor too soft.

226
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,750
I tend to run hot during the night

227
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,940
and I tend to sleep on
my side or on my stomach.

228
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,780
I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

229
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,890
about nine months ago,
and I'm sleeping better

230
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,810
than I ever have before.

231
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,530
So if you're interested
in upgrading your mattress

232
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,950
to one that's ideally
suited to your sleep needs,

233
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,840
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

234
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,200
take their two-minutes sleep quiz,

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,100
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

236
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,990
And you'll get up to $200
off that mattress order,

237
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,880
and two free pillows.

238
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,770
They have a 10-year warranty
and you get to try out

239
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,690
the mattress for a 100 nights risk-free,

240
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,360
they'll even pick it up for
you if you don't love it,

241
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,100
but I think you really will love it.

242
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,130
So again, if you're interested,

243
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,750
go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off

244
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,360
and two free pillows.

245
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,450
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

246
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,510
Athletic Greens is an

247
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,490
all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink.

248
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,837
I started drinking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

249
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,640
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

250
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,327
The reason I started
drinking Athletic Greens

251
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:48,800
and the reason why I still drink
it once or even twice a day

252
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,600
is because it takes care of all

253
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,330
my foundational nutritional needs.

254
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,820
It includes vitamins,
minerals, and probiotics

255
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,540
which are important
for the gut microbiome,

256
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,210
this colony of bacteria,

257
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,760
healthy bacteria that we
all have living in our guts.

258
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,029
And when that bacteria is healthy,

259
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,620
our brain functions better,

260
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,010
our immune system functions better.

261
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,880
There is now a lot of
research to support that.

262
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,650
Athletic Greens taste delicious.

263
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,480
I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice.

264
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,940
And as I mentioned, I drink
it once or twice a day,

265
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,670
usually in the morning and
again in the afternoon.

266
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,480
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

267
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,790
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

268
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,130
and claim a special offer.

269
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,360
That special offer is a
year supply of vitamin D3K2.

270
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
There's now a robust literature
showing that vitamin D3

271
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,470
is critical for various
aspects of our health,

272
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,220
metabolic health, endocrine
health, et cetera.

273
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,810
And you'll also get
five free travel packs.

274
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,580
When you travel mixing up Athletic Greens

275
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,590
is made really easy by
these little travel packs.

276
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,550
You just put them in a jar
or other a water bottle,

277
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,500
mix it with water.

278
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,130
It's very easy to do on a
plane or in the et cetera.

279
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,860
Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

280
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,340
to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs

281
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,350
and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

282
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,510
So let's talk about pleasure and pain.

283
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,400
I think we all intuitively understand

284
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,560
what pleasure and pain are.

285
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,220
Pleasure generally is
a sensation in the body

286
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,280
and in the mind that
leads us to pursue more

287
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,500
of whatever is bringing
about that sensation.

288
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,500
And pain is also a sensation
in the body and in the mind

289
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,170
that in general leads
us to want to withdraw

290
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,870
or move away from some
activity or interaction.

291
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,120
That's not always the case.

292
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,490
Some people actively seek out pain.

293
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,420
Some people somehow
can't seem to engage with

294
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,900
or experience pleasure,

295
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,130
but most people operate on this
basis of pleasure and pain.

296
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,320
Scientists would call
this appetitive behaviors,

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,730
meaning behaviors that lead
us to create an appetite

298
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,610
for more of those behaviors
and aversive behaviors,

299
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,800
behaviors that make us want
to move away from something.

300
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,140
The simplest example of
that would be putting your

301
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,800
hand near a hot flame, at some point,

302
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,570
there would be a reflex or a deep desire

303
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,770
to withdraw your hand.

304
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,290
Tasting something delicious
in general makes us want

305
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,120
to eat more of that thing.

306
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,030
Interactions with other
people that we find delicious,

307
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,750
also make us want to interact
with those people more.

308
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,330
None of this is complicated
or sophisticated.

309
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,640
This is simply to illustrate
the fact that pleasure and pain

310
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,720
tend to evoke opposite responses,

311
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,350
opposite behavioral responses

312
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,490
and opposite emotional responses.

313
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,180
So how does that come about?

314
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,120
Well, it really comes
about by an interaction

315
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,220
that starts at one end of
our body, meaning our skin

316
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,970
and the other end of
the organs of our body,

317
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,690
which is deep within the brain.

318
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,510
So let's consider these
two ends of the spectrum

319
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,460
of pleasure and pain
and what they contribute

320
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,763
to those experiences of pleasure and pain.

321
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,630
The organ that we call the
skin, as I mentioned earlier,

322
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,910
is the largest organ in our body.

323
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,190
And throughout that
organ, we have neurons,

324
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,300
little nerve cells.

325
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,040
Now to be really technical about it,

326
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,060
and the way I'd like you to understand it

327
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,440
is that the so-called cell
body meaning the location

328
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,080
of a cell in which the
DNA and other goodies

329
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,540
the kind of central factory of the cell,

330
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,340
that actually sits right
outside your spinal cord.

331
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,855
So all up and down your
spinal cord on either side

332
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,480
are these little blobs of neurons,

333
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,960
little collections of neurons.

334
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,360
They have a name if you'd like to know

335
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,370
for you aficionado or
those who are curious,

336
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,220
they're called DRGs dorsal root ganglia.

337
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,180
A ganglion is just a
collection or clump of cells.

338
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,670
And those DRGs are really
interesting because they send

339
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,440
one branch that we call an axon,

340
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,200
a little wire out to our
skin, also to our muscles

341
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,540
into our organs, but here
we're talking about the skin.

342
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,430
They send a wire out to our
skin and that wire literally

343
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,290
reaches up into the skin.

344
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,030
It's actually in our skin
and they have another wire

345
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,430
from that same cell body

346
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,610
that goes in the opposite direction,

347
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,990
which is up to our brain
and creates connections

348
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,520
within our brain in the
so-called brainstem.

349
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,510
What this means is that
the neuron in your body

350
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,990
that we call the DRG
that sends a wire an axon

351
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,590
to sense what's going on in your big toe

352
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,240
and then sends another axon
in the opposite direction

353
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,710
into the base of your brain,

354
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,900
that is the largest cell in
your entire body of any kind.

355
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,090
Fat cell, muscle cell,
nerve cell, et cetera.

356
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,780
Is extremely long cells.

357
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,580
It can be a meter or more depending

358
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,210
on how tall you happen to be.

359
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,671
So we have these cells that have wires

360
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,403
they go off in two different directions

361
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:44,888
and the wire that's within
our skin will respond

362
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:49,888
to any number of different
categories of stimuli.

363
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,020
These wires are positioned within the skin

364
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,620
to respond to mechanical forces.

365
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,120
So maybe light touch,

366
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,030
some will only send electrical activity up

367
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,500
toward the brain in
response to light touch.

368
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,650
Meaning if you press on
the skin really hard,

369
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,810
they don't respond.

370
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,310
You stroke the skin lightly
with your fingertips

371
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,650
or a feather and they
respond very robustly.

372
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,110
Others respond to course
pressure, the hard pressure,

373
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,350
but they won't respond to a
light feather, for instance.

374
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,400
Others respond to temperature.

375
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,948
So they will respond
to the presence of heat

376
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:30,040
or the presence of cold or
changes in heat and cold.

377
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,180
And still others respond
to other types of stimuli,

378
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,860
like certain chemicals on our skin.

379
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,380
Many of you have probably
experienced the sensation

380
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,170
of eating a hot pepper.

381
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,650
Well, I don't recommend doing this,

382
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,210
but were you to take a
little slice of jalapeno

383
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,090
or other hot pepper, habanero
pepper or something like that

384
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,480
and rub it on your skin, you
would actually feel something

385
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,170
at that location.

386
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,130
And that's because that
pepper doesn't just create

387
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,620
a sensation within your mouth,

388
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,030
it will create a similar
sensation on your skin.

389
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,350
So these neurons are amazing.

390
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,349
They're collecting information
of particular kinds

391
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,949
from the skin throughout the entire body

392
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,140
and sending that information
up toward the brain.

393
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,000
And what's really incredible,

394
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,069
I just want you to
ponder this for a second.

395
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,949
What's really incredible
is that the language

396
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,859
that those neurons use
is exactly the same.

397
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,349
The neuron that responds to light touch

398
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,809
sends electrical signals
up toward the brain,

399
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,260
the neurons that respond
to cold or to heat

400
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,980
or to habanero pepper, they only respond

401
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,980
to the particular thing that
evokes the electrical response.

402
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,930
I should say that they only respond

403
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,320
to the particular stimulus, the pepper,

404
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,840
the cold, the heat, et cetera,

405
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,490
that will evoke an electrical signal,

406
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,070
but the electrical signals
are a common language

407
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,380
that all neurons use.

408
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,110
And yet, if something cold
is presented to your skin,

409
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,410
like an ice cube, even if
you don't see that ice cube,

410
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,770
if your eyes are closed, or
someone comes up behind you

411
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,500
and puts an ice cube
against your bare skin back,

412
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,960
you know that that sensation,
that thing is cold.

413
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,553
You don't misperceive it as
heat or as a habanero pepper.

414
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,370
So that's amazing.

415
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,680
What that means is that
there must be another element

416
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,920
in the equation of what
creates pleasure or pain.

417
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,720
And that element is your brain.

418
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,500
Your brain takes these electrical signals

419
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,950
and interprets them.

420
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,780
Partially based on experience,

421
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,650
but also there are some
innate meaning some hard wired

422
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,610
aspects of pain and pleasure sensing

423
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,910
that require no experience whatsoever.

424
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,440
A child doesn't have to fall down but once

425
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,200
to know on that first fall, that hurt.

426
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
They don't have to touch a flame,

427
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,960
but once and the very first
time they will withdraw

428
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,920
their hand from the flame.

429
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,560
So no prior experiences required.

430
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,200
Other things prior experience is required.

431
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,480
For instance, if you're somebody that has

432
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,940
an intense, intense
aversion to spicy foods,

433
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,440
that's probably because you've
tasted spicy foods before.

434
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,070
Likewise, if you really like sweet foods,

435
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,460
it's probably because
you've tasted them before.

436
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,770
So you can start to make predictions

437
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,960
based on prior experience,

438
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,290
but the pain and pleasure system

439
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,600
don't need prior experience.

440
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,660
What they need is a
brain that can interpret

441
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,700
these electrical signals

442
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,110
that can take these electrical
signals and somehow create

443
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,160
what we call pleasure
and pain out of them.

444
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,750
So what parts of the brain?

445
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,310
Well, mainly it's the
so-called somatosensory cortex.

446
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,740
The portion of our neocortex,

447
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,743
which is on the outside of our brain,

448
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,980
that kind of bumpy part, not kind of

449
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,900
if you have a normally formed
brain, it will be bumpy.

450
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,010
If you have a smooth
brain that's not good.

451
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,740
Some animals just have a smooth brain.

452
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,715
Humans have a bumpy brain,

453
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:41,347
which means it has a
very large surface area.

454
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,210
And those bumps are 'cause
you squeezed it like a pizza

455
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,820
and clump and you bunched it all up

456
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,480
and put inside the skull.

457
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,313
That's good.

458
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,990
That means you have a lot of neurons.

459
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,310
And in your somatosensory cortex,

460
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,690
you have a map of your
entire body surface.

461
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,650
That map is called a homunculus.

462
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,900
And if we were to take your cortex

463
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,550
and lay it out on a table,

464
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,380
I've actually done this with the cortices

465
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,070
of various animals and humans included.

466
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,090
What you would find is that
there's literally a map

467
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,199
of your entire body surface.

468
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:15,010
But it wouldn't look exactly like you,

469
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,113
this map would be very distorted.

470
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,360
Why would it be distorted?

471
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,690
Well, certain areas of your body

472
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,980
have a much denser
innervation as we call it,

473
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,920
or put simply many more
of these sensory wires

474
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,300
from these DRGs within your skin.

475
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,670
So this map of you that
exists in your brain,

476
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,310
and you do have one of these
on each side of your brain,

477
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,670
so you have two of
these maps to homunculi,

478
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,390
that is you, it's your
representation of touch

479
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,230
including pleasure and pain.

480
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,730
And in that map, your lips are enormous.

481
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,740
And your back is very, very small.

482
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,430
And the area around your eyes

483
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,450
and the area representing your
face is absolutely enormous.

484
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,440
So you would look like some
sort of odd, weird clay doll

485
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,430
from some sort of bizarre
late night animation thing.

486
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,400
And just imagine the
psychedelic experience of that

487
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,500
character of you and that's
what it would look like.

488
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,560
But it's not randomly organized.

489
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,240
To the contrary, it's highly organized

490
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,090
in a very particular way,

491
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,580
which is that the areas of your skin

492
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,990
that have the highest density
of the sensory receptors

493
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,680
are magnified in your brain.

494
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,720
So it's sort of like having more pixels

495
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,860
in a certain part of a camera than others,

496
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,940
and in doing that
allowing higher resolution

497
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,500
in this case of touch, not a vision,

498
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,390
but of touch sensation in
certain parts of your body.

499
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,380
What are the areas that are magnified?

500
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,610
Well, the lips, the face,
the tips of the fingers,

501
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,130
the feet, and the genitals.

502
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,460
And so this map of you
has very large lips, face,

503
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,310
tips of fingers, bottoms
of feet, and genitals.

504
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,890
And that's because the innervation,

505
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,210
the number of wires that go
into those regions of your body

506
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,330
far exceeds the number of
wires for sensation of touch

507
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,430
that go to other areas of your body.

508
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,510
You can actually experience
this in real time right now

509
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,460
by doing a simple experiment that we call

510
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,440
two-point discrimination.

511
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,030
Two-points discrimination is your ability

512
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,410
to know whether or not
two points of pressure

513
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,920
are far apart, near each other,

514
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,270
or you actually could perceive incorrectly

515
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,370
as one point of pressure.

516
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,660
You might want a second
person to do this experiment.

517
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,640
Here's how you would do it.

518
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,960
You will close your eyes,

519
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,450
that person would take two fine points.

520
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,810
Don't make them too sharp, please.

521
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,800
So it could be two pencils
or pens or the backs of pens.

522
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,210
Two pens I'm holding in my hands.

523
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,300
If you're just listening to
this, I'm just holding two pens.

524
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,140
My favorite pens, these
pilot, V5 or V7, which I love.

525
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,200
If you were to close your eyes

526
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,610
and I were to take these two pens

527
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,760
and put their points close
together about a centimeter apart

528
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,680
and present them to the top of your hand,

529
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,410
I'm going to just going
to do that now to myself.

530
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,210
You, even though your eyes were closed,

531
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,520
you would be able to perceive
that that was two points

532
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,740
of pressure presented simultaneously

533
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,300
to the top of your hand.

534
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,920
However, if I were to do this
to the middle of your back,

535
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,680
you would not experience them
as two points of pressure.

536
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,100
You would experience them as
one single point of pressure.

537
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,900
In other words, your two point
discrimination is better,

538
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,890
is higher on areas of your body

539
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,750
which have many, many
more sensory receptors.

540
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,289
You are more sensitive at those locations.

541
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,070
Now this makes perfect
sense once you experience it

542
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,470
or you hear about it.

543
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,810
However, most of us
don't really appreciate

544
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,430
how important and what a
profound influence this change

545
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,060
in density of receptors
across our body surface has.

546
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,640
And we can go a step further
and describe another feature

547
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,290
of the way that you're built and the way

548
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,060
that you experience pleasure and pain,

549
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,160
which is called the dermatome.

550
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,890
The dermatome is literally the way

551
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,230
in which your body surface is carved up

552
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,200
into different territories.

553
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,900
Much like a map of the
United States is carved up

554
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,940
into different territories

555
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,240
of states and counties, et cetera.

556
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,040
The dermatome is the way in which neurons

557
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,530
connect to different parts of your body.

558
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,530
Now, you've actually experienced
the dermatome before.

559
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,150
The dermatome is when you have a neuron

560
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,570
that connects to a
particular area of the body

561
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,730
and that neuron doesn't just
send one little wire out

562
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,960
like one little line
and go up into the skin

563
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,950
to detect mechanical, or
thermal, or chemical stimuli.

564
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,800
It actually sends many
branches out like a tree.

565
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,100
But remember those
branches of the tree come

566
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,470
from one single neuron.

567
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,800
Now, occasionally what will
happen is you will experience

568
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,740
something like cold, or
heat, or pain, or tingling

569
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,690
on a patch of your body.

570
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,830
And occasionally that patch
of body will actually have

571
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,450
a very cleanly demarcated boundary,

572
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,060
a very stark boundary
with the areas around it.

573
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,570
A good example of this would
be the herpes simplex 1 virus,

574
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,369
which if one has this virus,

575
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:10,690
and I should mention that
somewhere between 80 and 90%

576
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,160
of people have this virus,

577
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,130
this is not a sexually transmitted virus.

578
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,880
This is a virus is transmitted
very easily between people

579
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,700
through various forms of
contact non-sexual contact,

580
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,880
it's present in children,
it's present in adults

581
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,230
and most people get it, some
get symptoms and some don't

582
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,130
some get recurring symptoms, some don't.

583
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,720
We can talk about that
at the end, if you like,

584
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,490
but this virus lives on what's called

585
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,190
the fifth cranial nerve also
called the trigeminal nerve.

586
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,580
The trigeminal nerve sends
branches out to the lips,

587
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,090
to the eyes, and to certain
portions of the face.

588
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,130
So for those of you listening,

589
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,850
I've just kind of put my
right hand across my face

590
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,270
and to sort of simulate
the three branches,

591
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,540
the trigeminal aspect of this nerve.

592
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,200
So tri three.

593
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,910
Now, when the herpes virus
flares up, as they say,

594
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,950
in response to stress or other factors,

595
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,450
the virus inflames that nerve

596
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,990
and people experience tingling
and pain on the nerve.

597
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,230
Sometimes they'll get a
cold sore or a blister

598
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,890
on their lip or near their mouth,

599
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,590
sometimes they'll get
a collection of those.

600
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,890
And that's because that
dermatome is actually inflamed.

601
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,800
Now other people will experience
something like shingles.

602
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,720
It's a fairly common viral infection.

603
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,890
And what they'll notice
is they'll get a rash

604
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,900
that has a boundary.

605
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,330
It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps,

606
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,230
sometimes blisters, and
it'll have a sharp boundary.

607
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,900
That boundary exists because
the virus exists on the nerve.

608
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,090
And so it actually is boundaried

609
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,450
with the neighboring area of the body

610
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,750
that's receiving input from another nerve

611
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,210
and that one doesn't have
the virus living on it.

612
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,180
So anytime you see a rash or
a pattern on the body surface

613
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,710
on the skin that has a
pretty stark boundary,

614
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,350
chances are that's an event
that's impacting the dermatome.

615
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,780
I've experienced this before

616
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,130
then not through herpes simplex,

617
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,650
but through the experience
of having a lot of blood

618
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,900
sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment

619
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,730
across the front of my
face, it was really bizarre.

620
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,440
I looked in the mirror and I
thought, what is going on here?

621
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,450
I was having an allergic
reaction to something I'd eaten.

622
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,890
And that allergic reaction
clearly was affecting one

623
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,850
of the nerves and therefore the dermatome

624
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,190
and what it showed up was,

625
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,930
it was almost like someone
had drawn lines on my face

626
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,130
that said, okay, this rash
or this reaction rather

627
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,500
can happen here, but not in
a region right next to it.

628
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,400
Whenever you see that chances are

629
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,810
it's a reaction of the
nerves of the dermatome.

630
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,110
So you'll start to see
these things more and more

631
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,392
when you start to look for them.

632
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,380
You don't always have to
have a viral infection

633
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,213
to experience this.

634
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:46,150
Sometimes you'll just experience tingling

635
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,020
or even a pleasant sensation,

636
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,320
and it will be restricted
in kind of a strict boundary

637
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,500
on one location or your body
surface and not another.

638
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,300
Not corresponding to an organ like,

639
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,640
okay, this arm or just your
feet or something like that.

640
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,730
But just a segment.

641
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,060
It's almost like someone
outlined a particular area

642
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,210
of her body surface.

643
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,810
That's the dermatome.

644
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,064
So you've got sensors in the skin

645
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,690
and you've got a brain
that's going to interpret

646
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,010
what's going on with those sensors.

647
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,170
In fact, we can take an
example of a sudden rash

648
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,770
or inflammation at one
location, the dermatome,

649
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,120
and we can ask what would make it hurt?

650
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,960
What would make it worse?

651
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,830
What would make it go away?

652
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,210
And believe it or not, your
subjective interpretation

653
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,700
of what's happening has
a profound influence

654
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,070
on your experience of pleasure or pain.

655
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,180
There are several things that
can impact these experiences,

656
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,860
but the main categories are expectation.

657
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,900
So sort of whether or not
you thought or could expect

658
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,640
that this thing was
going to happen, right?

659
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,540
If someone tells you
this is going to hurt,

660
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,280
I'm going to give you
an injection right here,

661
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
it might hurt for a second.

662
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,520
That's very different and
your experience of that pain

663
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,470
will be very different than
if it happened suddenly

664
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,950
out of the blue.

665
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,870
There's also anxiety, how anxious,

666
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,290
or how high or low your level
of arousal, autonomic arousal,

667
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,600
that's going to impact your
experience of pleasure or pain.

668
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,870
How well you slept and where you are

669
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,563
in the so-called circadian
or 24-hour cycle.

670
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,400
Our ability to tolerate
pain changes dramatically

671
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
across the 24-hour cycle.

672
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,470
And as you can imagine is
during the daylight waking hours

673
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,770
that we are better able to tolerate,

674
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,040
we are more resilient to pain,

675
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,980
and we are better able
to experience pleasure.

676
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,970
At night our threshold
for pain is much lower.

677
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,220
In other words, the amount of mechanical

678
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,980
or chemical or thermal
meaning temperature stimulated

679
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,830
that can evoke a pain response
and how we rate that response

680
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,130
is much lower at night.

681
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,370
And in particular, in the hours
between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM,

682
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,120
if you're on a kind of
standard circadian schedule.

683
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,850
And then the last one is our genes.

684
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,210
Pain threshold and how
long a pain response lasts

685
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,490
is in part dictated by our genes.

686
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,540
And later I'm going to discuss this myth

687
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,200
or whether or not it's really a myth

688
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,330
as to whether or not certain
people in particular red heads,

689
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,603
people who have reg
pigmented hair and fair skin,

690
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,970
whether or not their
pain thresholds differ.

691
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,500
And to just give you a
little sneak peek into that,

692
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,281
indeed they do and it's
because of a genetic difference

693
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:33,780
in a particular gene, in a
particular pattern of receptors

694
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,460
in the skin that are
related to the pigmentation

695
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,090
of hair and skin.

696
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,430
So we have expectation,
anxiety, how well we've slept,

697
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,300
where we are in the so-called
24-hour circadian time

698
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,863
and our genes.

699
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,660
So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety

700
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,920
because those two factors
can powerfully modulate

701
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,200
our experience of both pleasure and pain

702
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,200
in ways that will allow us to
dial up pleasure if we like

703
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,340
and to dial down pain, if indeed
that's what we want to do.

704
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,840
So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety

705
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,659
because those two things
are somewhat tethered.

706
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,470
There are now a number
of solid experiments,

707
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,570
both in animal models and in humans

708
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,310
that point to the fact that
if we know a painful stimulus

709
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,490
is coming, that we can better
prepare for it mentally

710
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,480
and therefore buffer or
reduce the pain response.

711
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,150
However, the timing in which
that anticipation occurs

712
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,610
is vital for this to happen.

713
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,030
And if that timing isn't quite right,

714
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,630
it actually can make the
experience of pain far worse.

715
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,780
So here I'm summarizing a
large amount of literature,

716
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,490
but essentially if subjects are warned

717
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,830
that a painful stimulus is coming,

718
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,830
their subjective experience of
that pain is vastly reduced.

719
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,250
However, if they are
warned just two seconds

720
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,530
before that pain arrives,
it does not help.

721
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,130
It actually makes it worse.

722
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,320
And the reason is they
can't do anything mentally

723
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,283
to prepare for it in that
brief two second window.

724
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,900
Similarly, if they are warned
about pain that's coming

725
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,670
two minutes before a
painful stimulus is coming

726
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,630
electric shock or a poke or
cold stimulus or heat stimulus

727
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,950
that's pretty extreme,
that also makes it worse

728
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,090
because their expectation
ramps up the autonomic arousal.

729
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,620
The level of alertness
is all funneled toward

730
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,690
that negative experience that's coming.

731
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,680
So how soon before a painful stimulus

732
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,160
should we know about it if the goal is

733
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,910
to reduce our level of pain?

734
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,720
And the answer is somewhere
between 20 seconds

735
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,070
and 40 seconds is about right.

736
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,700
Now, I'm averaging across a
number of different studies,

737
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,770
but if you have about
20 seconds or 40 seconds

738
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,130
advance warning that
something bad is coming,

739
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,260
you can prepare yourself for that,

740
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,249
but the preparation itself and the arousal

741
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:07,070
that comes with it,
the kind of leaning in,

742
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,480
okay, I'm either going to relax myself

743
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,830
or I'm going to really
kind of dig my heels in

744
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,303
and kind of meet the pain head on.

745
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,660
That seems to be the optimal window.

746
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,390
This can come and useful
in a variety of contexts,

747
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,320
but I think it's important
because what it illustrates

748
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,430
is that it absolutely cannot
be just the pattern of signals

749
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,550
that are arriving from
the skin, from these DRGs,

750
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,520
these neurons that connect to skin

751
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,850
that dictates our experience
of pain or pleasure.

752
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,440
There has to be a subjective
interpretation component,

753
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,990
and indeed that's the case.

754
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,300
So let's talk about the
range of pain experiences.

755
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,130
And from that, we will understand better

756
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,383
what the range of pleasure experiences are

757
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:53,300
that different people have
because we are all different

758
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,100
in terms of our pain threshold.

759
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,220
First of all, what is pain threshold?

760
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,390
Pain threshold has two dimensions.

761
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,390
The first dimension is the
amount of mechanical or chemical

762
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,840
or thermal stimulation
that it takes for you or me

763
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,350
or somebody else to say,
I can't take that anymore.

764
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,620
I'm done.

765
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,190
But there's another element as well

766
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,120
which is how long the pain persists.

767
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,389
I'll just describe myself for example,

768
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,159
I don't consider myself somebody

769
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,529
who has a particularly
high pain threshold.

770
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,239
I don't think it's
particularly low either,

771
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,659
but I wouldn't consider myself somebody

772
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,309
that has a particularly
high pain threshold.

773
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,969
When I stubbed my toe against
the corner of the bed,

774
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,859
it absolutely hurts.

775
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,130
But one thing that I've noticed is

776
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,389
that I have very sharp
inflections, very high inflections

777
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:41,459
in my perception of pain, and
then they go away quickly.

778
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,940
I don't know if that's adaptive or not.

779
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,170
It's probably not,

780
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,429
but my experience of pain is
very intense, but very brief.

781
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:51,109
Other people experience pain in a much

782
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,690
kind of slower rising,
but longer-lasting manner.

783
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,760
And to just really point
out how varied we all are

784
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,700
in terms of our experience of pain,

785
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,920
let's look to an experiment.

786
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,620
There been experiments done
at Stanford School of Medicine

787
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,770
and elsewhere, which
involved having subjects

788
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,910
put their hand into a
very cold vat of water

789
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,450
and measuring the amount of time

790
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,320
that they kept their hand in that water.

791
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,990
And then they would tell the
experimenter very quietly,

792
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,990
how painful that particular stimulus was

793
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,540
on a scale of one to 10
so-called Likert scale

794
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,833
for your aficionados.

795
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,730
That simple experiment
revealed that people experience

796
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,130
the same thermal in this
case, cold stimulus,

797
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,470
vastly different.

798
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,280
Some people would rate it as
a 10 out of 10 extreme pain.

799
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,040
Other people would rate it
as barely painful at all,

800
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,890
like a one.

801
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,380
Other people, a three other
people, a five, et cetera.

802
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,300
Now what's interesting is
that the same thing is true

803
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,590
for experience of a hot, painful stimulus

804
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,474
120 degree hot plate, where you
have to put your hand on it,

805
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:58,790
and then at some point
you remove your hand.

806
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,739
Some people are able to keep their hand

807
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:03,840
on there the whole time, but
people rate that experience

808
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,700
as very painful, a little bit painful

809
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,100
or moderately painful
depending on who they are.

810
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,780
Now, that's interesting,

811
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,390
probably not that surprising, however,

812
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,130
but what is very interesting is that

813
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,720
when the same experiment
was done on medical doctors

814
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,680
or medical doctors in training,

815
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,550
they too of course experienced pain

816
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,250
through a range of subjective experiences.

817
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,050
Some of them just like any
other person off the street

818
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,810
said a particular stimulus
of a particular temperature

819
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,817
was very painful, other said
it wasn't painful at all

820
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:38,450
and some said it was moderately painful.

821
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,630
And that turns out to be vitally important

822
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,130
for the treatment of pain

823
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,870
because pain is not an event in the skin.

824
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,230
Pain is a subjective,
emotional experience.

825
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,917
You may have heard that we
have a particular category

826
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,440
of these DRGs that innervate the skin,

827
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,562
which are called nociceptors.

828
00:36:56,562 --> 00:37:01,090
Nociceptor comes from the word
noci, nocere I believe it is,

829
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,690
which means to harm.

830
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,160
However, nociceptors don't
carry information about pain,

831
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,070
they carry information about
particular types of stimuli

832
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,490
impacting the skin.

833
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,150
And then the brain assigns
a value of valence to it,

834
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,530
a label and says that's painful.

835
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,910
And where people draw the
line between not painful

836
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,450
and painful varies.

837
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,210
Now, because physicians are people

838
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,620
and because physicians treat pain,

839
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,240
what we know from a lot of data
now is that if someone comes

840
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,990
into the clinic and says they're
experiencing chronic pain

841
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,600
or whole body pain or
acute pain after an injury

842
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,330
or one location, it doesn't
really matter what the cause is

843
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,203
or even if there's a cause at all,

844
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,620
how the doctor reacts to that
report of the patient's pain

845
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,490
will dictate in many cases
the course of treatment.

846
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,590
And of course doctors, their
goal is to treat the patient

847
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,740
to going to the patient's
needs, not their own.

848
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,020
And that's what good doctors do.

849
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,480
However, it's been found and
I think now there is work

850
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,320
being done to try and change this,

851
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,570
but if a doctor has a very
high threshold for pain,

852
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,270
their interpretation of
somebody else's report of pain

853
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,300
is going to be different.

854
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,680
They might not discount
the patient, right?

855
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,650
This doesn't necessarily
mean that they think, oh,

856
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,870
this person their pain is
irrelevant, probably not.

857
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,580
In fact, from having a
high threshold for pain,

858
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,390
if someone comes in and
says, I'm in extreme pain,

859
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,690
that doctor probably thinks,

860
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,240
wow, this has to be
really, really extreme,

861
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,830
but they can be talking about
two different experiences.

862
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,440
Similarly, if a physician has
a very low threshold for pain,

863
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,063
and someone comes in and says,

864
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,210
yeah, I'm experiencing
some pain in my back.

865
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,460
I've got the sciatica thing, but yeah,

866
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,850
it's a little bit uncomfortable.

867
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,590
It's like a, I don't know
like a four out of 10.

868
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,720
Well, that physician might
interpret that four out of 10

869
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,200
as a pretty extreme sense of pain

870
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,220
or pretty extreme experience of pain.

871
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,990
And so you can start to see
how the subjective nature

872
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,760
of pain can start to have real impact

873
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,180
on the treatment of pain
because treatment of pain

874
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,760
is carried out by physicians.

875
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,960
In fact, there is no
objective measure of pain.

876
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,820
We can ask how long
somebody can keep their hand

877
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,840
on a hot plate or in a cold bath.

878
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,213
You can do various experiments.

879
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:17,490
They even have some extreme experiments

880
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,220
where they'll shave a portion of the leg

881
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,820
and they'll put on a very
painful chemical compound

882
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,510
and see how long people can tolerate that.

883
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,460
These are very uncomfortable
experiments as you can imagine,

884
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,350
but in general, we don't have a way

885
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,070
of measuring somebody else's
subjective experience of pain.

886
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,810
There is no blood pressure measure.

887
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,601
There's no heart rate beats
per minute measure of pain.

888
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:41,760
So one of the great
efforts of neuroscience

889
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,910
and of medicine is to try and come up

890
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,963
with more objective measures of pain.

891
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,260
Similarly, pleasure is something
that we all talk about.

892
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,540
Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that

893
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,040
or more of that please or less of that,

894
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,050
but we have no way of
gauging what other people

895
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,920
are experiencing except what
they report through language.

896
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,030
And so this is really just to illustrate

897
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,690
that this whole thing around
pain isn't a black box.

898
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,900
We do have an understanding
of the elements.

899
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,740
There are elements in the skin,

900
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,870
there's elements of the brain,

901
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,570
there's expectation,
anxiety, sleep, and genes,

902
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,440
but that it is very complicated.

903
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,290
And yet there are certain principles

904
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,770
that fall out of that complicated picture

905
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,490
that can allow us to better
understand and navigate

906
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,560
this axis that we call
the pleasure-pain axis.

907
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,840
So rather than focus on just
the subjective nature of pain,

908
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,270
let's talk about the
absolute qualities of pain

909
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,100
and the absolute qualities of pleasure

910
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,680
so that we can learn how to
navigate those two experiences

911
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,033
in ways that serve us each better.

912
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,790
First of all, I want to
talk about heat and cold.

913
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,520
We do indeed have sensors in our skin

914
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,540
that respond to heat and cold.

915
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,090
And for any of you that
have entered a cold shower

916
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,950
or a cold body of water of any
kind or ice bath, et cetera,

917
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,400
you will realize that getting
into cold is much harder

918
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,240
if you do it slowly.

919
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,940
Now, despite that people
tend to do it very slowly.

920
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,420
I have noticed an enormous
variation with which people

921
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,450
can embrace the experience of cold.

922
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,430
I noticed it because I do
some work with athletes

923
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,650
and I do some work with military

924
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,510
and I do some work with
the general public.

925
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,940
And one of the best tests of
how somebody can handle pain

926
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,210
is to ask them to just
get into an ice bath.

927
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,010
It's not a very sophisticated experience,

928
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,320
but it really gets into the
core of the kind of circuitry

929
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,403
that we're talking about, both
in the skin and in the brain.

930
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,860
Some people regardless of
sex, regardless of age,

931
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,890
and regardless of physical ability

932
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,783
can just get into the cold.

933
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,860
They're somehow able to do it.

934
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,840
Now, I don't know what their
experience of the cold is.

935
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,673
And neither do you.

936
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,245
You only know your experience,

937
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:53,400
but they're able to do that.

938
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,010
Some do it quickly, some do it slowly.

939
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,580
Others find the experience
of cold to be so aversive

940
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,830
that they somehow cannot
get themselves in.

941
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,490
They start quaking, they start complaining

942
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,860
and many of them just simply get out.

943
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,693
They can't do it.

944
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:09,880
Some don't even get in past their knees.

945
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,080
This isn't necessarily
about pain threshold,

946
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,523
but it's related to that.

947
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,060
I think it can be helpful
to everyone to know

948
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,440
that even though it feels
better at a mental level

949
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,460
to get into the cold
slowly and people ask, oh,

950
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,211
I just want to get in slowly,
I want to take my time.

951
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,960
It is actually much worse

952
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,320
from a neuro-biological perspective.

953
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,870
The neurons that sense cold respond

954
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,310
to what are called relative
drops in temperature.

955
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,820
So it's not about the absolute
temperature of the water.

956
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,530
It's about the relative
change in temperature.

957
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,300
So as you move from a
particular temperature,

958
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,360
whether or not it's in the
air next to an ice bath

959
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,350
or cold shower, or from a
body of water that's warm

960
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,170
to a body of water that's colder,

961
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,755
or sometimes in the ocean,
you'll notice it's warm.

962
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,690
And then as you swim out further,

963
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,330
you'll get into a pocket of
water where it's much colder.

964
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,370
That's when the cold receptors
in your skin start firing

965
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,800
and sending signals up to your brain.

966
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,210
Therefore, you can bypass
these signals going up

967
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,450
to the brain with each relative
change one degree change,

968
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,620
two degrees change, et cetera,

969
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,140
by simply getting in all at once.

970
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,940
In fact it is true and maybe
you've been told this before,

971
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,510
and it is true that if
you get into cold water

972
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,930
up to your neck,

973
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,370
it's actually much more comfortable

974
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,410
than if you're halfway in and halfway out.

975
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,810
And that's because of the
difference in the signals

976
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,950
that are being sent
from the cold receptors

977
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,910
on your upper torso,

978
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,000
which is out of the water
in your lower torso.

979
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,310
Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this

980
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,470
to mean that they should just jump

981
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,830
into an unknown body of water.

982
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,950
There are all sorts of
factors like currents,

983
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,340
and if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed.

984
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,290
You can stop the heart.

985
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,830
People can have heart attacks from getting

986
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,830
into extremely cold water,
like a melted mountain stream

987
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,690
that's been frozen all winter,

988
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,490
or has been very, very cold or
as a snow pack going into it.

989
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,630
If very cold, you can
indeed have a heart attack.

990
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,290
So please be smart about
how cold and what bodies

991
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,630
of cold water you happen
to put yourself into.

992
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,150
But it is absolutely true
that provided it safe,

993
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,220
getting into a cold water
is always going to be easier

994
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,400
to do quickly and is going to be easier

995
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,070
to do up to your neck.

996
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,010
In fact, you actually want to
get your shoulders submerged.

997
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,690
There are a number of
other things you can do

998
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,410
if you really want and it's safe to do.

999
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,530
You can put your face under and activate

1000
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,920
the so-called dive reflex,
which also makes the tolerance

1001
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,000
of cold easier believe it or not.

1002
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,210
So it's very counterintuitive.

1003
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,540
It's like getting into water
faster and more completely

1004
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,720
you will experience as less
uncomfortable, less cold.

1005
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,340
And indeed that's the case.

1006
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,630
And that's because these cold receptors

1007
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,870
are measuring every relative
drop in temperature.

1008
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,380
So every single one is
graded as we say in biology,

1009
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,783
it's not absolute.

1010
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,360
As an additional point, if
you're sitting in a body

1011
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,400
of cold water and it's not circulating,

1012
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,090
you'll notice that you start
to warm up a little bit.

1013
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,490
Or even if you feel like
you're freezing cold,

1014
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,870
if you move and that water
around you moves, of course,

1015
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,910
then you'll notice it's got even colder.

1016
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,500
And that's because
there's a thermal layer.

1017
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,270
You're actually heating up the water

1018
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,270
that surrounds your body

1019
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,880
like a halo around every
aspect of your body.

1020
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,780
A sort of silhouette of you of heat

1021
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,100
where you're heating that water.

1022
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,820
When you move, you disrupt
that thermal layer.

1023
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,100
Now heat is the opposite.

1024
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,290
Heat and the heat receptors in your skin

1025
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,860
respond to absolute
changes in temperature.

1026
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,400
And this is probably because our body

1027
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,100
and our brain can tolerate
drops in temperature

1028
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,788
much better than it can tolerate

1029
00:45:33,788 --> 00:45:36,580
increases in temperature safely.

1030
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,250
So when you move from say a
standard outdoor environment,

1031
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,110
I mean, here in the States

1032
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,710
we measure in terms of Fahrenheit.

1033
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,150
So maybe it's a 75 or an 80
degree, or even 90 degree day,

1034
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,780
and you get into a 100 degrees sauna,

1035
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,700
or if you're in a cool
air conditioned building

1036
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,340
and you go outside and
it's very warm outside,

1037
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,450
you sort of feel like the heat
hits you all at once, boom.

1038
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,730
Hits you all at once, kind
of like a slap in the face,

1039
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,650
but then it will just stay at that level.

1040
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,500
Your body will acclimate to
that particular temperature.

1041
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,370
However, if that temperature
is very, very high,

1042
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,100
you'll notice that your
experience of that heat

1043
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,640
and your experience of
kind of pain and discomfort

1044
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,110
and your desire to get out of that heat

1045
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,250
will tend to persist.

1046
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,570
You don't really adapt in the same way.

1047
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,230
And certain people who are really good

1048
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,620
at handling very hot
sauna, get better at this.

1049
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,140
You learned to calm your
breathing, et cetera,

1050
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,210
lower your autonomic arousal.

1051
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,950
Obviously you don't want to
let your body temperature

1052
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,670
go too high because
neurons cook, they die.

1053
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,660
If neurons die, they don't
come back and that's bad.

1054
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:39,360
Many people unfortunately harm
themselves with hyperthermia.

1055
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,570
Everyone has a different threshold
for this, but in general,

1056
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,640
you don't want your body
temperature to go up too high.

1057
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,720
That's why a fever of like 103 starts

1058
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,450
to become worrisome 104.

1059
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,940
You really get concerned if and it goes

1060
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,490
up into that range or higher,

1061
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,610
that's when you need to
really cool down the body

1062
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,913
or get to hospital so
they can cool you down.

1063
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:02,410
Heat is measured in absolute
terms by the neurons.

1064
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,620
So gradually moving into heat makes sense,

1065
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,870
and finding that threshold,

1066
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,980
which is safe and comfortable for you,

1067
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,180
or if it's uncomfortable,

1068
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,680
at least resides within
that realm of safety.

1069
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,000
So that's heat and cold,

1070
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,220
and those are sort of non-negotiables.

1071
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,630
You can try and lower
your level of arousal.

1072
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,797
In fact, many people who
get into a cold shower

1073
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,770
and ice bath I think the recommendation

1074
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,620
that I always give is that

1075
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,890
you have two possible approaches to that.

1076
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,590
You can either try and relax yourself,

1077
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,590
kind of just stay calm within the cold,

1078
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,780
or you can lean into it.

1079
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,820
You can actually take mental steps

1080
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,760
to generate more adrenaline

1081
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,950
to kind of meet the demands of that cold.

1082
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,960
And at some point we'll
do a whole episode on

1083
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,780
how to use cold and heat
to certain advantages

1084
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,590
we've done a little bit
of this in past episodes

1085
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,050
using the cold to
supercharge human performance

1086
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,270
and things of that sort.

1087
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:57,671
But in general, cold is
measured in relative terms.

1088
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:00,828
And therefore getting in all
at once is a good idea provided

1089
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:02,100
you can do it safely.

1090
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,760
And heat is measured in absolute levels

1091
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,360
by your brain and body and therefore

1092
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,100
you want to actually
move into it gradually.

1093
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,350
So it's the kind of the inverse
of what you might think.

1094
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,650
One of the most important
things to understand

1095
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,430
about the experience of pain
and to really illustrate

1096
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,312
just how subjective pain really is,

1097
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:23,490
is that our experience of
pain and the degree of damage

1098
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,960
to our body are not always correlated.

1099
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,400
And in fact, sometimes can
be in opposite directions.

1100
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,820
A good example of this would be x-rays.

1101
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,440
We all occasionally get
x-rays at least in the US

1102
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,930
we get x-rays when we go to
the dentist from time to time,

1103
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,280
and the occasional x-ray might be safe

1104
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,380
depending on who you are

1105
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,440
provide you're not pregnant, et cetera.

1106
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,445
I've gone to the dentist.

1107
00:48:43,445 --> 00:48:44,278
They put you in the chair,

1108
00:48:44,278 --> 00:48:45,770
they cover you with the lead blanket,

1109
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,840
and then they run behind the
screen to protect themselves.

1110
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,760
And they beam me with the
x-rays to get a picture

1111
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,580
of your teeth and your jaws
and your skull, et cetera.

1112
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,320
Well, if you were to get too many x-rays,

1113
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,400
you could severely damage
the tissues of your body,

1114
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,803
but you don't experience any
pain during the x-ray itself.

1115
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:09,679
In contrast, you can think
that your body is damaged

1116
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,790
and experienced extreme pain

1117
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,750
and yet your body can have no damage.

1118
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,870
A classic example of this was published

1119
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,880
in the British Journal of Medicine,

1120
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,110
in which a construction worker fell from

1121
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,480
I think it was a second
story, which he was working

1122
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:32,030
and a nail went up and through his boot

1123
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:35,340
and he looked down and
he saw the nail going

1124
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,340
through his boot and he was
in absolute excruciating pain.

1125
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:44,160
They took him to the hospital
and because the nail was

1126
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,380
so long and because of
where it had entered,

1127
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,610
it exited the boot, they
had to cut away the boot

1128
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,200
in order to get to the nail.

1129
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,280
And when they did that,

1130
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,130
they revealed that the nail had passed

1131
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,880
between two of his toes.

1132
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,880
It had actually failed to
impale his body in any way.

1133
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,930
And yet the view, the
perception of that nail

1134
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,010
entering his boot at one
end and exiting the boot

1135
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,420
at the other was sufficient
to create the experience

1136
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,360
of a nail that had gone through his foot.

1137
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,640
And the moment he realized
that that nail had not gone

1138
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,800
through his foot, the pain
completely evaporated.

1139
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,020
And this has been
demonstrated numerous times.

1140
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,610
People that work in emergency rooms

1141
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,160
actually see variations on this.

1142
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,050
Not always that extreme,

1143
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:32,410
but many times what we see
and how we perceive that wound

1144
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,940
or that event has a profound influence

1145
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,650
on how we experience pain.

1146
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,950
And I mentioned this,
not just because it's a

1147
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,190
kind of sensational and fantastic example

1148
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,630
of this extreme,
subjective nature of pain,

1149
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,320
but also because it brings
us back to this element

1150
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,560
which is, we don't know
how other people feel.

1151
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,776
Not just about pain, but about pleasure.

1152
00:50:51,776 --> 00:50:55,330
We think we do, we have some general sense

1153
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,750
of whether or not an event ought

1154
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,830
to be painful or pleasurable,

1155
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,990
but actually we barely
understand how we feel

1156
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,690
let alone how other people feel,

1157
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:07,300
and we can be badly
wrong about how we feel

1158
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,050
meaning we can misinterpret
our own sense of pain

1159
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,920
or our own sense of pleasure
depending on what we see

1160
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,390
with our eyes and what
we hear with our ears.

1161
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:21,000
So we hear a scream like a shrill scream,

1162
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,860
and we think it must be pain.

1163
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,930
And if we look at something
that's happening to somebody

1164
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,510
and it fits a prior category
or a prior representation

1165
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,170
of what we would consider
painful stimulus,

1166
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,250
well, then we think that
they're an extreme pain,

1167
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,660
but actually they might
not be in pain at all.

1168
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,320
Now this highly subjective nature of pain

1169
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,650
and the way in which we
use our visual system

1170
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,080
to interpret other people's
pain and our own pain

1171
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,410
has actually been leveraged
to treat a very extreme form

1172
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:50,890
of chronic pain.

1173
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,140
And it's an absolutely fascinating area

1174
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,690
of biology and neuroscience.

1175
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,260
And it's one that we can
actually all leverage

1176
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,060
toward reducing our own levels of pain

1177
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,410
whenever we are injured.

1178
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,620
Or believe it or not,
even in chronic pain.

1179
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,730
To describe this area of science requires

1180
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,870
a kind of extreme example,

1181
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,420
but I want to be clear that
even if you don't suffer

1182
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,570
from this extreme example,

1183
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,333
there's relevance and a
tool to extract for you.

1184
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,910
The extreme example is
that of an amputated digit,

1185
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,740
meaning one of your fingers or your toes,

1186
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,030
or of an amputated limb.

1187
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:31,030
So people that have digits or
limbs that are gone missing

1188
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,830
from an injury or surgical removal,

1189
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,830
will often have the experience
that it's still there.

1190
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:41,140
The so-called phantom limb phenomenon.

1191
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,750
Now, why would that be?

1192
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:47,671
Well, when you remove a
particular finger or limb,

1193
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:50,240
obviously that finger and limb is gone

1194
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,650
and the dorsal root ganglion neuron

1195
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,980
that would normally send a wire out

1196
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,180
to that particular region of the body,

1197
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,560
that wire is no longer
there because that portion

1198
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,860
of the body is no longer there.

1199
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,540
And in some cases, those neurons die

1200
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,870
almost always, but not always.

1201
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,650
However, the map your
so-called homunculus,

1202
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:13,373
your representation of yourself
in the brain is still there.

1203
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,670
And this map, the so-called homunculus map

1204
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,540
that you have in that
I have is very plastic.

1205
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,630
It can change.

1206
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,890
And so as a consequence areas of the map

1207
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,720
that adjacent to one another

1208
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,340
can actually start to invade
other areas of the map.

1209
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,890
So for instance, there
are neuroimaging studies

1210
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,660
that have documented that somebody

1211
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,833
that has say a complete
removal of their left arm,

1212
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,240
the representation of
their left arm still exists

1213
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,900
in the cortex.

1214
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,990
And experimentally if one is to stimulate

1215
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,210
that area of the cortex, that person,

1216
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,660
and if that person were you,

1217
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,930
would experience having that arm

1218
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,100
that it were being stimulated,
even though it's not there.

1219
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,520
Now, someone who has an
amputated arm doesn't need

1220
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,330
to have their brain stimulated

1221
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,000
in order to have the experience

1222
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,960
of that phantom limb being present.

1223
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,990
In fact, many people who have
limbs that were amputated

1224
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,650
feel as if that limb is still present

1225
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,540
even though obviously it's not.

1226
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,150
And no matter how many
times they look to the stump

1227
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,860
and just see a stump,
somehow it doesn't reorganize

1228
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,093
that homunculus so-called
central brain map.

1229
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,600
Now, that would be fine.

1230
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,920
You might even think that would be better,

1231
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,940
better to think you have the arm there

1232
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,110
than to feel as if it's missing,

1233
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,380
and yet many people who
have amputated limbs

1234
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,220
report phantom limb pain.

1235
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,450
They don't feel that the arm

1236
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,540
is just casually draped next to them.

1237
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,590
They feel as if it's bunched
up and it's an extreme pain.

1238
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,500
In fact, this kind of contorted stance

1239
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,980
that I'm taking right here in my chair

1240
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,270
is not unlike the way that
these patients described this.

1241
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,280
They feel as if it's kind of cramped up,

1242
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,660
it's very uncomfortable for them.

1243
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,410
Now, and absolutely creative

1244
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:04,330
and you could even say genius scientists

1245
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,830
by the name of Ramachandra.

1246
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,700
That's actually his last name,

1247
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,970
his complete name is a
little bit more complicated.

1248
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:13,450
So you all almost always hear
Ramachandran referred to as

1249
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,800
Ramachandran or V.S Ramachandran
because his full name

1250
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,870
is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.

1251
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,360
So a lot of letters in
there, a lot of vowels,

1252
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,990
but Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.

1253
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,350
He was actually a colleague of mine

1254
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,910
when my lab was formerly

1255
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,060
at the University of
California, San Diego.

1256
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,770
Has done a lot of work on
this phantom limb phenomenon.

1257
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:37,490
And Ramachandra actually started
off as a vision scientist.

1258
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,620
And he understood the
power of the visual system

1259
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,810
in dictating our experience

1260
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,520
of things like pain and pleasure.

1261
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,490
And so what he developed
was a very low technology

1262
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:52,060
yet neuroscientifically
sophisticated treatment

1263
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,850
for phantom limb.

1264
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,270
It consisted of a box, literally a box

1265
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,460
that had mirrors inside of it.

1266
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,350
And the patient would put
the intact hand or limb

1267
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,040
into one side,

1268
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,340
and obviously they couldn't
put the amputated limb

1269
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,370
into the other side, but
because of the configuration

1270
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,100
of the mirrors, it
appeared as though they had

1271
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,480
two symmetric limbs inside the box.

1272
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,440
And then he would have
them look at that limb

1273
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,260
and move it around.

1274
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,640
And as they would do this,

1275
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,110
they would report real time movement,

1276
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:27,510
or I should say real time
perception of movement

1277
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,140
in the phantom limb.

1278
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,750
Now this is absolutely
incredible but makes total sense

1279
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,010
when you think about
the so-called top down

1280
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:37,470
or contextual modulation
of our sensory experience,

1281
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,990
remember it's anticipation, it's anxiety,

1282
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,270
it's interpretation of what's happening

1283
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:45,400
that drives our perception
of what's happening.

1284
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,700
And so, as he would have these patients

1285
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,200
move their intact limb to
a more relaxed position,

1286
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,180
the patients would feel

1287
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,190
as if the phantom limb were relaxing.

1288
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,160
And this was used successfully
to treat phantom limb pain

1289
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,040
in a number of different people.

1290
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,240
It didn't always work.

1291
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,270
And you can imagine sometimes

1292
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,010
it might be a little
trickier like for a leg

1293
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:09,470
although there have been leg
boxes that have been developed

1294
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,510
and arranged for this purpose.

1295
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,830
And what was remarkable
is that they could finish

1296
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,670
these experiments and have
the patient, the person

1297
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,520
enter a state of relaxation,

1298
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,260
reduced the pain in the phantom limb,

1299
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,220
and it would stay there
even though, of course,

1300
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,010
as they exited the mirror box,

1301
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,410
they would go about their
life and use their intact limb

1302
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,640
for its various purposes.

1303
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,680
I love this experiment
because it really speaks

1304
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,510
to the subjective nature
of pain and pleasure.

1305
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,530
It speaks to the power
of the visual system,

1306
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,300
like what we see just like the nail

1307
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,270
through the boot experiment.

1308
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:44,370
What we see profoundly
impacts our experience

1309
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:47,150
of pleasure and pain in this case pain.

1310
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:52,070
Now, there's another aspect
to the phantom limb experience

1311
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,790
and of these maps, the
so-called homunculus maps

1312
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,870
in the cortex that Ramachandran worked on,

1313
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:01,060
which has very interesting
and reveals the degree

1314
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,880
to which these maps are
plastic or can change

1315
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,450
in response to experience.

1316
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,570
Turns out that because of the locations

1317
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,910
of different body part
representations within these maps,

1318
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,920
certain parts of our body that
normally we don't think of

1319
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,920
as related can start to
create merged experiences.

1320
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,260
What do I mean by that?

1321
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,440
Well, Ramchandran described a patient

1322
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,440
who had a somewhat odd experience
of having lost their foot.

1323
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,800
So they actually had their foot amputated

1324
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,390
about midway up the Achilles.

1325
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:41,120
So lower portion of the calf and foot.

1326
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,270
I don't recall what the reason
was for having it removed.

1327
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,010
And fortunately for this patient,

1328
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:50,270
they did not experience pain
in that portion of their body,

1329
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,280
but rather they confided in him

1330
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,820
that whenever they would have sex,

1331
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,200
they would experience their
orgasm in their phantom foot

1332
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,830
in addition to in their
genitals, of course.

1333
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:07,380
And Ramachandra understood
the homunculus map.

1334
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,730
And he understood that this
was because the representation

1335
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,770
of the foot within the homunculus
actually lies adjacent to,

1336
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,190
and is somewhat interdigitated with

1337
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:21,010
it actually kind of merges
with the representation

1338
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,880
of the genitalia.

1339
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,490
Now that's a weird situation.

1340
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,940
And yet you now know that
the density of innovation

1341
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,710
of the feet and the genitalia,

1342
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,407
as well as the lips and
the face are actually

1343
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:37,890
the highest sensory innervation

1344
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,660
that you have in your entire body.

1345
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,550
And this speaks to, I think,

1346
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,430
a more important general
principle for all people

1347
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,840
of the experience of pleasure or pain,

1348
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,210
which is that an aspect
of our pain or pleasure

1349
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,720
can be highly localized.

1350
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,870
It can be because of a cut
to a particular location

1351
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,870
on the body or it can
because of a fall injury

1352
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:04,130
or a kind of bruise on
one side of our body.

1353
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,970
And yet our experience
of pleasure and pain

1354
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,190
can also be an almost
a body-wide experience.

1355
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,830
And yet it's always most rich.

1356
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,430
It's always most heightened
in these regions of our body

1357
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,180
that have dense sensory innervation.

1358
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,280
So we experience pain
and pleasure according

1359
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,800
to local phenomenon receptors in the skin,

1360
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,010
and this homunculus map

1361
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,000
that has all these different territories,

1362
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,940
but because of the way that
those territories are related,

1363
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,460
this kind of wild example of
somebody experiencing orgasm

1364
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,650
in their phantom foot speaks
to the larger experience.

1365
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:39,570
The more typical rather
experience that I should say

1366
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,160
that all people have,

1367
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,150
which is that pleasure can be body-wide

1368
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,290
or we can experience it in our face

1369
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,130
or the bottoms of our feet
and other areas of the body

1370
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,120
that we experience pleasure
and similarly with pain.

1371
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,250
And that brings us to the
topic of whole body pain,

1372
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,060
not just localized pain, as
well as whole body pleasure

1373
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,460
not just localized pleasure.

1374
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:05,200
There are a number of
examples of whole body pain

1375
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,390
that people suffer from.

1376
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:10,385
And one common one is called fibromyalgia.

1377
01:01:10,385 --> 01:01:12,690
I want to just first share
with you a little bit

1378
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,410
of medical insight.

1379
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,040
A few months back, I did an Instagram live

1380
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,970
with Dr. Sean Mackey
who's an MD medical doctor

1381
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,710
and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine

1382
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,220
that was recorded and
placed on my Instagram.

1383
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,460
If you want to check it out,

1384
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,180
we can provide a link to
that in the show notes.

1385
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:34,100
Dr. Mackey is the Chief
of the Division of Pain

1386
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,930
at Stanford School of Medicine.

1387
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,070
So he's a scientist.

1388
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:40,070
He studies pain and he
treats patients dealing

1389
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,100
with various forms of
pain, whole body pain,

1390
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,230
like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.

1391
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,170
And he shared with me
something very interesting,

1392
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:52,162
which is that anytime you
hear or see the word syndrome,

1393
01:01:52,162 --> 01:01:55,740
that means the medical
establishment does not understand

1394
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,590
what's going on.

1395
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,970
A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms

1396
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:02,220
that point in a particular direction

1397
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,050
or some general set of directions about

1398
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,530
what could be going on,

1399
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:10,530
but it doesn't reveal a true
underlying disease necessarily.

1400
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,890
It could be aggregative diseases

1401
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,360
or it could be something else entirely.

1402
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,700
And I want to make sure that I emphasize

1403
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,400
the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.

1404
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,590
I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic

1405
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:26,620
and we interpret that as
meaning all in one's head.

1406
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,410
But I think it's important to remember

1407
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,600
that everything is neural,

1408
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,410
whether that's pain in your body

1409
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,670
'cause you have a gaping wound

1410
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,620
and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound

1411
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:40,150
or whether or not it's pain
for which you cannot explain it

1412
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,640
on the basis of any kind of injury.

1413
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,680
It's all neural.

1414
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,033
So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic

1415
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:47,360
it's kind of irrelevant.

1416
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,713
And I hope someday we
move past that language.

1417
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,123
Psychosomatic is interesting.

1418
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,220
There was a paper that
was published in 2015,

1419
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,520
and then again in 2020 a different paper

1420
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,810
focused on the so-called
psychogenic fevers

1421
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,030
or psychosomatic effects.

1422
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,420
I just briefly want to mention this

1423
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,693
because it relates back to pain.

1424
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,790
These studies have shown
that there are areas

1425
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,050
of the so-called thalamus,

1426
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,770
which integrates and
filter sensory information

1427
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:17,250
of different kinds.

1428
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,287
And within the brainstem,
an area called the DMH

1429
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,060
and I can also provide a link
to this study if you like,

1430
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,110
that shows that there is
a true neurological basis.

1431
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,110
There are brain areas and
circuits that are related to

1432
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:34,430
what's called psychogenic
fever when we are stressed.

1433
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:37,620
And in particular, if we
think that we were injured

1434
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,820
or that we were infected by something,

1435
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,090
we can actually generate a true fever.

1436
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:45,240
It is not an imagined fever.

1437
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,320
It is our thinking generating

1438
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,510
an increase in body temperature.

1439
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,630
And so this has been called psychosomatic.

1440
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:56,790
It's been called psychogenic,
but it has a neural basis.

1441
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:01,460
So when we hear syndrome and
a patient comes into a clinic

1442
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,690
and says that they suffer for instance,

1443
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,150
from something which is
very controversial frankly

1444
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,750
like chronic fatigue syndrome,

1445
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:10,050
some physicians believe that it reflects

1446
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:13,438
a real underlying medical
condition, others don't.

1447
01:04:13,438 --> 01:04:18,220
However, syndrome means
we don't understand.

1448
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,290
And that doesn't mean
something doesn't exist.

1449
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:25,320
Fibromyalgia or whole
body pain for a long time

1450
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,630
was written off or kind of explained away

1451
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,290
by physicians and scientists
frankly, my community

1452
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,370
as one of these syndromes.

1453
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,520
It couldn't be explained.

1454
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,760
However, now there is
what I would consider

1455
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,880
and I think others would
and should consider

1456
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,110
from understanding of at
least one of the bases

1457
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,920
for this whole body pain.

1458
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,240
And that's activation of
a particular cell type

1459
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,880
called glial.

1460
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,780
And there's a receptor on these glial

1461
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,100
for those of you that want to
know called the toll 4 receptor

1462
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:01,000
and activation of the
toll 4 receptor is related

1463
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,970
to certain forms of whole
body pain and fibromyalgia.

1464
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,470
Now, what treatments
exist for fibromyalgia.

1465
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,290
And even if you don't
suffer from fibromyalgia,

1466
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,200
and even if you don't know anyone who does

1467
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,480
this is important information

1468
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,290
because what I'm about to tell you relate

1469
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:20,800
to how you and your body,
which is you of course

1470
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,100
can deal with pain of any kind.

1471
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,560
And there are actually things
that one can do and take

1472
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,560
that can encourage
nerve health in general.

1473
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,770
In other conditions like
diabetic neuropathy,

1474
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,140
but in all individuals.

1475
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:39,140
So there are clinical data
using a prescription drug.

1476
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,570
This is work that actually was done

1477
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,940
by Dr. Mackey and colleagues.

1478
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,890
The drug is called naltrexone.

1479
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,520
Naltrexone is actually
used for the treatment

1480
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,780
of various opioid addictions
and things of that sort,

1481
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,080
but it turns out that a very low dose,

1482
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,810
I believe it was a one 10th
the size of the typical dose

1483
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:03,415
of naltrexone has been
shown to have some success

1484
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:06,650
in dealing with and treating
certain forms of fibromyalgia.

1485
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:09,520
And it has that success
because of its ability

1486
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,360
to bind to and block these
toll four receptors on glial.

1487
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,250
So this so-called syndrome
or this thing that previously

1488
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,120
was called a syndrome, fibromyalgia

1489
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,230
actually has a biological basis.

1490
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:23,660
It was not just inpatients heads.

1491
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,630
And I really tip my hat to
the medical establishment

1492
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,470
including Dr. Mackey and others

1493
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:32,070
who explored the potential
underlying biologies

1494
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,810
of things like fibromyalgia
and are starting

1495
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,030
to arrive at treatments.

1496
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,070
Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor,

1497
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:38,590
so I'm not prescribing anything.

1498
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:39,970
You should talk to your doctor of course,

1499
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:43,170
if you have fibromyalgia
or other forms of chronic

1500
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,100
or whole body pain to explore
whether or not these low dose

1501
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,860
naltrexone treatments are right for you.

1502
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,640
But I think it's a beautiful
case study if you will,

1503
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,340
not a case study of an individual patient,

1504
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:58,340
but a case in study of linking
up the patient's self-report

1505
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,790
of these experiences and using science

1506
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,500
to try to establish clinical treatments.

1507
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,280
There's another treatment,

1508
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,920
or I should say there's another approach

1509
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,753
that one could take.

1510
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:10,220
And again, I'm not recommending
people do this necessarily.

1511
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,310
You have to determine what's
right and say for you,

1512
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,510
I cannot do that.

1513
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,790
There's no way your
situation's very far too much,

1514
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,300
and it would be outside of my wheelhouse

1515
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:22,850
to prescribe anything, but
there's a particular compound

1516
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:25,190
which in the United States
is sold over the counter

1517
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:26,730
and in Europe is prescription.

1518
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,970
It's one that I've talked
about on this podcast before

1519
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,110
for other purposes.

1520
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:33,437
And that compound is acetylcarnitine.

1521
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:36,947
Acetylcarnitine as I
mentioned is by prescription

1522
01:07:36,947 --> 01:07:38,317
in most countries in Europe

1523
01:07:38,317 --> 01:07:41,250
and the US you can buy
this over the counter.

1524
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,980
There is evidence that
acetylcarnitine can reduce

1525
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,930
the symptoms of chronic whole body pain

1526
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,650
and other certain forms of acute pain

1527
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:53,160
at dosages of somewhere
between one to three

1528
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,480
and sometimes four grams per day.

1529
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,040
Now acetylcarnitine can be taken orally.

1530
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,770
It's found in 500 milligram capsules,

1531
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:03,290
as well as by injection.

1532
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:06,660
By injection in the States
in the United States that is

1533
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,350
also requires a prescription

1534
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,950
or requires a prescription I should say.

1535
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:13,260
The over-the-counter forms
are generally capsules

1536
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,540
or powders.

1537
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:17,609
Those apparently do not
require a prescription.

1538
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:20,499
There are several studies
exploring acetylcarnitine

1539
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,000
in this context, as well
as for diabetic neuropathy.

1540
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,330
And what's interesting about
acetylcarnitine is it's one

1541
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:30,069
of the few compounds that isn't just used

1542
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:31,649
for the treatment of pain,

1543
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,219
but has also been shown
in certain contacts

1544
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,800
to improve peripheral
nerve health generally.

1545
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,510
And for that reason, it's
an interesting compound.

1546
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:43,680
I've also talked about
acetylcarnitine on here previously,

1547
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:48,029
because it has robust effects
on things like spur motility

1548
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:52,959
and health, including the
speeds at which sperms swim,

1549
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,620
how straight they swim
turns out that swimming

1550
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,569
for sperm is more efficient
if they swim straight,

1551
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:02,449
as opposed to like those
kids in on the swim team,

1552
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,120
they're like banging up
against the lane lines

1553
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,229
and zigzagging all over the place.

1554
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:10,719
So it does turn out to be the
case that the quickest route

1555
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,618
between any two places is a straight line

1556
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:14,469
and the good sperm know that,

1557
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,707
and the less good sperm
don't seem to know that.

1558
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:19,850
And acetylcarnitine seems to
facilitate straight swimming

1559
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,640
trajectories as well as speed of swimming

1560
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,170
and overall sperm health.

1561
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,800
And there is evidence from
quality peer reviewed studies

1562
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,960
showing that acetylcarnitine
supplementation can also be

1563
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,840
beneficial for women's fertility
in ways that it affects

1564
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,609
perhaps we don't really
know the mechanism,

1565
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:39,799
health and status of the
egg or egg implantation.

1566
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,210
There are a large number of
studies on acetylcarnitine.

1567
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,700
You can look those up
on Pub Med, if you like,

1568
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,710
or on examine.com.

1569
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,500
There are some studies that I don't think

1570
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,410
are included there which are
particularly interesting.

1571
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:55,210
One that I just would like
to reference the last name

1572
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:00,210
of the first author is
Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I.

1573
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,580
The title of the paper is

1574
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,820
Effects of l -Carnitine Supplementation

1575
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,060
on Serum Inflammatory Markers

1576
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,780
and Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes

1577
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:12,130
in Females with Knee Osteoarthritis.

1578
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,630
So this is a randomized double
blind placebo controlled

1579
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,362
pilot study that showed
really interesting effects

1580
01:10:17,362 --> 01:10:21,450
of short term supplementation
of acetylcarnitine.

1581
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,941
Longer term, the effects
were less impressive.

1582
01:10:23,941 --> 01:10:26,360
So it's pretty interesting
that this compound has

1583
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,240
so many different effects.

1584
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,370
How could it have these effects?

1585
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:30,410
Well, it appears that
it's having these effects

1586
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:35,070
through its impact on the
so-called inflammatory cytokines.

1587
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,708
Inflammatory cytokines for
those of you that don't know

1588
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,760
are secreted by the immune system

1589
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,080
in response to different stressors,

1590
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,710
physical stressors, mental stressors too

1591
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:47,770
food that you eat that isn't good for you.

1592
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,210
The so-called hidden sugars.

1593
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,800
Yes, will increase inflammation

1594
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,150
if they're ingested too often,

1595
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,730
or in amounts that are
too high in quantity.

1596
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,940
Things like Interleukin 1 beta,

1597
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,730
things like C-reactive protein,

1598
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,230
things like interleukin 6.

1599
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,260
Interleukin 6 is kind of the
generic inflammatory marker

1600
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,490
that all studies refer to.

1601
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,490
And yet there are other interleukins,

1602
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:09,920
please note that there
are other interleukins

1603
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,720
like interleukin 10 that
are anti-inflammatory.

1604
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,520
So immune system can secrete
inflammatory molecules

1605
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,730
to deal with wounds and stress and things.

1606
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:19,960
And in the short term that's good,

1607
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,650
and in the longterm that's bad.

1608
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:26,650
And it can secrete anti-inflammatory
cytokines like IL10.

1609
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,490
And these matrix metalloproteinases,

1610
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:30,700
it's kind of a mouthful,

1611
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,030
but these matrix metalloproteinases
are very interesting.

1612
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:37,400
Anytime you see A-S-E, ASE
that's generally an enzyme,

1613
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,880
which means that these
compounds in this case,

1614
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,930
these matrix metalloproteinases are used

1615
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,994
to break down certain
elements around wounds

1616
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:49,820
and scoring which might
sound like a bad thing,

1617
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,170
but in some cases is good
because it allows certain cells

1618
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:55,130
like glial cells so-called microglia

1619
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,560
to come in like low ambulances,

1620
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,400
like low paramedics and clean up wounds.

1621
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,950
So scarring and inflammation

1622
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,640
is kind of a double-edged sword.

1623
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,130
It can be good, but too much scarring.

1624
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,870
If it contains a wound too much,

1625
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:09,030
doesn't allow the
infiltration of cell types

1626
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,750
to move in and take care of
that wound and heal it up.

1627
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,259
So it appears that L-carnitine
is impacting a number

1628
01:12:14,259 --> 01:12:17,080
of different processes,
both to impact pain

1629
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,210
and perhaps, and I want
to underscore perhaps,

1630
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,260
but there are good studies happening now,

1631
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:25,660
perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.

1632
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,277
As long as we're talking about acute pain

1633
01:12:27,277 --> 01:12:29,350
and chronic pain and supplementation

1634
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:32,060
and non-prescription drugs,
at least in the United States

1635
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,980
that people can take to deal
with pain of various kinds,

1636
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,920
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two

1637
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,010
that I get asked most often about,

1638
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:44,010
which are agmatine and
S-adenosyl-L-methionine,

1639
01:12:44,207 --> 01:12:45,793
which is sometimes called SAMe.

1640
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,300
Both of those have been
shown to have some impact

1641
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,520
categorized on examine as notable impact

1642
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,190
on various forms of pain,
due to osteoarthritis,

1643
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,830
or due to injury of various
kinds of indifferent subject

1644
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:05,350
population, men, women, people
of different ages, et cetera.

1645
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,700
SAMe in particular has been interesting

1646
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,120
because it's been shown head to head

1647
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:14,350
with drugs like Naproxen and
other drugs of that sort,

1648
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,850
which are well established
and sold over the counter

1649
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:21,010
in the US to work at least as well

1650
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,030
as some of those compounds
at certain doses.

1651
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,847
But it's also shown that SAMe

1652
01:13:26,847 --> 01:13:29,260
and some of those things take more time

1653
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,540
in order to have those effects.

1654
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,283
In fact, head to head
with things like Neproxin

1655
01:13:34,283 --> 01:13:37,090
have been shown that they
can take up to a month

1656
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:39,300
in order to have the
pain relieving effect.

1657
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,990
Now, whether or not that
makes them a better choice

1658
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:43,640
or a worst choice really
depends on your circumstances.

1659
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,340
I'm certainly not recommending
that anybody take anything,

1660
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,930
but I do think it's interesting
and important to point out

1661
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,400
that things like
agmatine, things like SAMe

1662
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,629
have been shown under
certain circumstances

1663
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:57,020
to be beneficial for pain and
they are outside the realm

1664
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,030
of prescription drugs.

1665
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:00,260
I think this is a growing area of

1666
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,340
some people call them supplements,

1667
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,510
some people call them nutraceuticals.

1668
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:05,410
Look, at the end of the
day these are compounds

1669
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,960
that affect cellular processes.

1670
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,930
And the more that we understand

1671
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,658
how they affect those cellar processes

1672
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:13,110
as we now do for things
like acetylcarnitine,

1673
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:15,460
I think the more trust
that we can put into them,

1674
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,140
or the more to which we
might want to avoid them

1675
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,750
because of some of the side effects

1676
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,360
or contra-indications that
those compounds could have.

1677
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,408
If you're interested in
those other compounds,

1678
01:14:25,408 --> 01:14:28,810
I do invite you as I always
do to check out examine.com,

1679
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,098
but also to do your
research on those compounds

1680
01:14:31,098 --> 01:14:33,060
by simply putting them into Google

1681
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,390
or putting them into PubMed,
which would be even better.

1682
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:37,220
And if you are going to go into PubMed,

1683
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,160
if you're going to
start playing scientist,

1684
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,958
which I do encourage you to do,

1685
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:43,630
I would encourage you to
not just read abstracts,

1686
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,860
but if you can, if the
studies are freely available,

1687
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,080
I realized not all of
them are freely available

1688
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,260
to try and read those studies

1689
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,710
at least to the extent that you can.

1690
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:54,050
There's a particularly nice
study that you might look at

1691
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:57,460
that was published in
2010 in Pain Medicine,

1692
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,470
which is Keynan et al K-E-Y-N-A-N,

1693
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:03,340
which looked at the safety and efficacy

1694
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,510
of dietary agmatine sulfate

1695
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,807
on lumbar disc associated radiculopathy

1696
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,910
not laughing at the condition.

1697
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,900
It's a painful condition that describes a,

1698
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,910
it's a kind of a range
of symptoms that relate

1699
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,180
to pinching of nerves.

1700
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,013
The spinal columns,

1701
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:23,150
I was laughing at my pronunciation of it.

1702
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:25,570
That particular study is quite good.

1703
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:29,610
And the conclusion of that
study that they drew was that

1704
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,560
there were limited side effects

1705
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,240
and that dietary agmatine sulfate is safe

1706
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,670
and efficacious for treating
and alleviating pain

1707
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,470
and improving quality of life

1708
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,890
and lumbar-disc associated pain.

1709
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:45,890
However, there were very
specific dosage regimens

1710
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,250
that were described there
and duration of treatment.

1711
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:51,250
And so you should not take
anything that I say or that study

1712
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,060
to mean that you can just
take this stuff willy-nilly

1713
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:56,030
or at any concentration
of course, or dose.

1714
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:59,310
You always want to pay attention
to what the science says.

1715
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:02,040
That paper fortunately is
freely available online.

1716
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,270
And we will also provide
a link to that study.

1717
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,140
For those of you that
are interested in SAMe

1718
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:10,170
and its usage for the treatment
of various types of pain,

1719
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,873
and perhaps other benefits,

1720
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,017
a number of companies
have stopped making SAMe

1721
01:16:16,017 --> 01:16:18,930
instead what they're now
focusing on is what they think

1722
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,265
is a better or more
bioavailable alternative,

1723
01:16:22,265 --> 01:16:27,070
which is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
or 5-MTHF.

1724
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:33,550
This molecule is necessary
for converting homocysteine

1725
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:37,320
to methionine, which is
then converted to SAMe

1726
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,600
so rather than taking SAMe directly,

1727
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,580
the idea is to take
something that's upstream

1728
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,570
of SAMe and make more SAMe
endogenously available.

1729
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,010
This is a different strategy.

1730
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,880
I've talked about this strategy before

1731
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,270
for increasing other things
like growth hormone, et cetera.

1732
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:55,430
There's always this
question of whether or not

1733
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,070
in trying to increase the
amount of a particular molecule

1734
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,257
in the body, whether or not
taking that specific molecule

1735
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:03,630
was the best thing or
working further upstream

1736
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:07,260
as it's referred to
working on the precursor

1737
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,070
or increasing the levels of the precursor

1738
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:10,990
is the better way to go.

1739
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:15,990
It appears that this
5-MTHF is the strategy

1740
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:21,160
that people are now taking in
place of taking SAMe directly.

1741
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,390
So in other words, they're taking this

1742
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:25,430
in order to get elevated levels of SAMe.

1743
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,840
Now, I'd like to turn our attention

1744
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,570
to a completely non drug, non
supplement related approach

1745
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:32,960
to dealing with pain.

1746
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,960
And it's one that has existed
for thousands of years.

1747
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,864
And that only recently has the
Western scientific community

1748
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:43,820
started to pay serious attention to,

1749
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:46,850
but they have started to
pay serious attention to it.

1750
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:51,680
And there is terrific mechanistic
science to now explain

1751
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,600
how and why acupuncture can work very well

1752
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,090
for the treatment of
certain forms of pain.

1753
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:01,590
Now, first off, I want to
tell you what was told to me

1754
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:04,490
by our director or Chief
of the Pain Division

1755
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,010
at Stanford School of
Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,

1756
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,240
which was that some
people respond very well

1757
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:13,246
to acupuncture and others do not.

1758
01:18:13,246 --> 01:18:17,470
And the challenge is
identifying who'll respond well

1759
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,760
and who won't respond well.

1760
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,280
Now, when I say won't respond well,

1761
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,438
that doesn't necessarily
mean that they responded

1762
01:18:23,438 --> 01:18:26,500
in a negative way, that
it was bad for them,

1763
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,890
but it does appear that
a fraction of people

1764
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:33,020
experienced tremendous pain
relief from acupuncture

1765
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,900
and others experience
none at all or very little

1766
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,410
to the point where they have to seek out

1767
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:38,673
other forms of treatment.

1768
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,670
The science on this is still ongoing.

1769
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:44,640
There was actually an excellent
paper published on this

1770
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,050
in the Journal of the
American Medical Association,

1771
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,620
one of the premier
medical clinical journals.

1772
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:52,780
And it basically reinforced the idea

1773
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,629
that you have responders
and non-responders.

1774
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:59,040
A number of laboratories
have started to explore

1775
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,250
how acupuncture works.

1776
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,750
And one of the premier
laboratories for this

1777
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,624
is Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School.

1778
01:19:07,624 --> 01:19:11,480
Qiufu has spent many years
studying the pain system

1779
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,950
and a system that's
related to the pain system,

1780
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:17,603
which is the system that
controls our sensation of itch.

1781
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:21,230
Just as a brief aside about itch,

1782
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:25,470
itch and pain are often co
associated with one another.

1783
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,650
I was recently in Texas,
and I will tell you,

1784
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,000
they have some mean mosquitoes.

1785
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,590
They're small, but
whatever they're injecting

1786
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:33,550
into your skin.

1787
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:35,740
Well, here I am talking now
about my subjective experience

1788
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,030
of pain, whatever they
injected into my skin

1789
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:42,230
felt to me like the most
extreme mosquito bites

1790
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:44,830
I've ever had, not while
they were biting me,

1791
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:47,390
not while they were
injecting the venom, but boy,

1792
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,271
those Texas mosquitoes make me itch.

1793
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,400
How do they do it?

1794
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,540
Well, their venom creates little packets

1795
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,430
of so-called histamine that travel around

1796
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:01,070
those packets are called mast cells,

1797
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,400
little packets of histamine
that go to that location

1798
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,640
and make me and presumably you

1799
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,860
want to scratch those mosquito bites.

1800
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:09,080
I scratch mine you scratch yours,

1801
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,050
but we both scratch our mosquito bites.

1802
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,140
And when we do that, the
histamines are released.

1803
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,510
That gets red and inflamed
and the itch even worse.

1804
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,230
The inflammation is actually
caused by the histamine.

1805
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:24,230
Well, that experience of
inflammation and pain and itch

1806
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:26,643
is what we call a pyrogenic experience.

1807
01:20:26,643 --> 01:20:29,910
So we we have pain which is
nociception, essentially,

1808
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,672
I know that the pain of aficionado

1809
01:20:34,672 --> 01:20:36,830
always get a little upset
because they say, oh,

1810
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:38,730
there's no such thing
as as a pain receptor,

1811
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,160
it's no susceptive receptors

1812
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,790
and pain is subjective experience.

1813
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,510
Yes, I acknowledge all that.

1814
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:46,470
But for fluency, let's
just think about pain

1815
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:49,100
as a certain experience and
itch as a separate experience,

1816
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,360
but they often exist together
because those mosquito bites

1817
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,940
were what I would call painful,
or at least not pleasant.

1818
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:58,770
They didn't just itch,
they were also painful nuts

1819
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,780
because itch brings with it inflammation

1820
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,800
and inflammation often
brings with it pain relief,

1821
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,690
but it can also bring with
it the sensation of pain.

1822
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:10,660
So itch and pain are
two separate phenomenon.

1823
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:13,860
It was actually discovered
through a really interesting

1824
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,490
phenomenon that relates to something

1825
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:18,290
that is actually consumed
in supplement form,

1826
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,490
which is this tropical legume.

1827
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,690
It's actually a bean
called Mucuna pruriens.

1828
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:28,690
That's M-U-C-U-N-A that's
one word P-R-U-I-E-N-S

1829
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:34,360
Mucuna pruriens is a bean,
it's as legume that this bean

1830
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:37,310
is 99% L-DOPA.

1831
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:40,060
It's dopamine or rather it's
the precursor to dopamine

1832
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,470
and people buy this stuff
and take it over the counter

1833
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,680
as ways to increase
their levels of dopamine.

1834
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,860
It does make you feel
really dopamine doubt,

1835
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,800
meaning it makes you feel a
little high and really motivated

1836
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,690
and really energetic
a lot like other drugs

1837
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:55,130
that will do that.

1838
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:57,810
I don't necessarily recommend
taking Mucuna pruriens.

1839
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:00,030
I personally don't like taking it.

1840
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:01,160
Doesn't make me feel good.

1841
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,890
I crash really hard when I take it.

1842
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:07,880
But on the outside of
this bean is a compound

1843
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,520
that makes people itch.

1844
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,650
So they remove this when you
take it in supplement form.

1845
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:14,580
In fact, it's usually in capsule form,

1846
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:18,080
but the outside of this
bean, it's like a hairy bean.

1847
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,056
And those little hairs contain a compound,

1848
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,840
which was actually used
to study and identify

1849
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,110
these itchy receptors in the skin.

1850
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:30,060
So we don't have time to go
into all the details of itch,

1851
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,420
but it's pretty interesting
that you have these compounds

1852
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,030
out in nature that can make us itch.

1853
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,560
Inside them they have dopamine.

1854
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,540
I mean, this is really weird,

1855
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,900
but plant compounds are really powerful.

1856
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,640
So don't let anyone tell
you that because something's

1857
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,052
from a plant or an earth
that it's not powerful.

1858
01:22:44,052 --> 01:22:47,500
There are very powerful
plant and herb compounds.

1859
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,220
Mucuna prurien being one of
them with dopamine on the inside

1860
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,310
and itchy stuff on the outside.

1861
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:54,610
Now, what does this all
have to do with acupuncture?

1862
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:58,750
Well, Qiufu Ma's lab
has not just identified

1863
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:01,950
the itch pathway, this pruritus
genes as they're called,

1864
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:04,940
which causes itch and
the pyrogenic phenomenon

1865
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:07,230
of itch being separate from pain.

1866
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:12,230
His lab has also studied how
acupuncture causes relief of,

1867
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,100
but also can exacerbate pain.

1868
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,080
Now, the form of acupuncture
that they explored

1869
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,710
was one that's commonly in
use called electroacupuncture.

1870
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:23,100
So this isn't just putting little needles

1871
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,000
into different parts of the body.

1872
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,730
These needles are able to
pass an electrical current,

1873
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:29,970
not magically, but because they have

1874
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,360
a little wire going back to a device

1875
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,760
and you can pass electrical current.

1876
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,053
Here's what they found.

1877
01:23:34,053 --> 01:23:37,450
This is a study published
in the journal neuron

1878
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:40,500
Cell Press journal, excellent
journal, very high stringency.

1879
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,530
So what Qiufu Ma's lab found
was that if electroacupuncture

1880
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,343
is provided to the abdomen,
to the stomach area,

1881
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,170
it creates activation of what are called

1882
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,410
the sympathetic ganglia.

1883
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,070
These have nothing to do with sympathy

1884
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:58,350
in the emotional sense has to
do with the stress response.

1885
01:23:58,350 --> 01:23:59,630
Sympa just means together.

1886
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:02,693
So it activated a bunch of
neurons along the spinal cord.

1887
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,780
And the activation of
these neurons evolves

1888
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,780
neural adrenaline and something
called NPY neuropeptide Y.

1889
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,630
The long and short of it is
that stimulating the abdomen

1890
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:20,630
with electroacupuncture was
either anti-inflammatory

1891
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:22,650
or it could cause inflammation.

1892
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:25,200
It could actually exacerbate
inflammation depending

1893
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,810
on whether or not it was
of low or high intensity.

1894
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:31,020
Now that makes it a very
precarious technique.

1895
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,360
And this may speak to some of the reason

1896
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,320
why some people report
relief from acupuncture

1897
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,780
and others do not.

1898
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:41,550
However, they went a step further
and stimulated other areas

1899
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,472
of the body using electroacupuncture.

1900
01:24:43,472 --> 01:24:46,100
And what they found is that
stimulation of the legs

1901
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,930
of the hind limbs, as
it's called an animals,

1902
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:51,380
and the legs in humans caused a circuit,

1903
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,450
a neural circuit to be activated that goes

1904
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:57,920
from the legs up to an area
of the base of the brain

1905
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,310
called the DMV not the DMH,
which I mentioned earlier,

1906
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:04,350
but the DMV like you go to the DMV,

1907
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,820
which is a miserable experience
for most people, forgive me,

1908
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:09,320
DMV employees, but let's be honest

1909
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,160
most people don't enjoy
going to the DMV as patrons,

1910
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,040
but we have to so we go.

1911
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,450
The DMV and low intensity stimulation,

1912
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:23,920
this electroacupuncture of the
hind limbs activated the DMV

1913
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,830
and activated the adrenal glands,

1914
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:30,100
which sit at top of your
kidneys and cause the release

1915
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,810
of what are called catecholamines.

1916
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:35,340
And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.

1917
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:40,340
In other words, electroacupuncture
of the legs and feet can,

1918
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,100
if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory

1919
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,140
and reduce symptoms of pain.

1920
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,430
And can we think accelerate wound healing

1921
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,900
because activations of these
catecholaminergic pathways

1922
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,140
can accelerate wound healing as well.

1923
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:58,350
So the takeaway from this is
that while there are thousands

1924
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:02,860
of years and millions of
subjects involved in explorations

1925
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,813
of electroacupuncture and acupuncture,

1926
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,030
Western medicine is
starting to come into this

1927
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,080
and start to explore underlying mechanism.

1928
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,720
Now, for those of you
that love acupuncture

1929
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,300
and are real proponents of it,

1930
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,640
it's worked for you, you might say,

1931
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,330
well, why does Western medicine
even need to come into this?

1932
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:22,370
Why should they even be exploring this?

1933
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,400
But we should all be
relieved that they are

1934
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,880
because what's starting to happen now

1935
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,540
is that as the mechanistic basis for this

1936
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,563
is starting to come to light,

1937
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:35,990
insurance coverage of
things like acupuncture

1938
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,150
is starting to emerge as well.

1939
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:40,380
And this is in contrast to other therapies

1940
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,000
for which there's a lot
of anecdotal evidence,

1941
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,180
but very little mechanistic understanding.

1942
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:48,407
One example of that would
be laser photo biomodulation

1943
01:26:48,407 --> 01:26:52,410
the use of lasers of
different types really

1944
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:54,680
to treat pain and to
accelerate wound healing.

1945
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,590
A lot of people claim that
this can really help them.

1946
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,129
However, most places,
at least in the States,

1947
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:01,800
won't cover this with insurance

1948
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,184
or don't perform this in standard clinics.

1949
01:27:04,184 --> 01:27:08,310
And the reason is the underlying
mechanism isn't known.

1950
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,900
I'm not going to get into the
argument about whether or not

1951
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,660
mechanistic understanding
should or should not be required

1952
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,800
in order to have insurance
coverage of things that work.

1953
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,110
That's not what this is about.

1954
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,350
And that actually will
be a boring discussion

1955
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:23,670
because I'm shouting at
a tunnel through you.

1956
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:25,330
And I wouldn't be able
to hear you shout back

1957
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:27,220
no matter what your stance on that is,

1958
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:30,938
but just trust me when I
say that I am both relieved

1959
01:27:30,938 --> 01:27:35,040
and delighted to hear that
excellent medical institutions

1960
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,033
like Stanford are starting to
think about electroacupuncture

1961
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:39,866
and how it can work.

1962
01:27:39,866 --> 01:27:42,210
That places like Harvard
Medical School are starting

1963
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:44,320
to explore this at a mechanistic level.

1964
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,840
And I do believe that
there's an open-mindedness

1965
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:49,402
that starting to emerge for instance,

1966
01:27:49,402 --> 01:27:52,000
the National Institutes of Health,

1967
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,090
not only has an institute
for mental health

1968
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:55,760
and cancer research and an eye institute,

1969
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,553
but now complementary
health, the so-called NCCIH.

1970
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,970
National Institutes of
Complementary Health

1971
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,660
that is exploring things
like electroacupuncture,

1972
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:08,080
meditation, various supplements
and things of those sort.

1973
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,190
I do think that we're entering
a new realm in which things

1974
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:13,800
like pain and pain management
will be met with more openness

1975
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,970
by all physicians, at
least that's my hope.

1976
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,829
So please take that into
consideration right now.

1977
01:28:18,829 --> 01:28:22,270
The mechanistic evidence
for laser photobiomodulation

1978
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:23,190
is not strong.

1979
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:27,330
One of the major issues
or the barriers to that

1980
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:30,235
is that most of the
studies that are out there

1981
01:28:30,235 --> 01:28:33,030
were actually paid for by companies

1982
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:38,030
that build devices for
laser photobiomodulation.

1983
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,800
And so we really need
independent studies funded

1984
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,260
by federal institutions that have no bias

1985
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,900
or financial relationship
in order to gain trust

1986
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,783
in whatever data happen to emerge.

1987
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,650
There is a technique that at one time

1988
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:53,070
was considered alternative,

1989
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,880
but now has a lot of mechanistic science

1990
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:59,230
to explain how it works,
and it does indeed work

1991
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:03,543
for the treatment of chronic
and also for acute pain.

1992
01:29:03,543 --> 01:29:08,543
And that treatment is hypnosis
in particular self-hypnosis.

1993
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:12,170
Now, my colleague at Stanford
in fact, my collaborator,

1994
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,950
Dr. David Spiegel, our
Associate Chair of Psychiatry

1995
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,670
has devoted his professional life

1996
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:20,300
to developing hypnosis
tools that people can use

1997
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,500
to help them sleep better, focus better,

1998
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,730
stay motivated, et cetera.

1999
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:26,680
While most people hear
hypnosis and they think,

2000
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,090
oh, this is stage hypnosis.

2001
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,480
People walking around like chickens

2002
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,690
are being forced to laugh

2003
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:33,100
or fall asleep on command, et cetera.

2004
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,620
This is completely
different than all that.

2005
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,910
This is self hypnosis
and there are now dozens,

2006
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:41,690
if not more quality peer
reviewed studies published

2007
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:44,980
in excellent journals done by Dr. Spiegel

2008
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:47,570
and others at other universities.

2009
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:50,640
It really all has to do
with how self-hypnosis

2010
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,600
can modulate activity
of the prefrontal cortex

2011
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,230
and related structures like the insula.

2012
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:02,230
The prefrontal cortex is involved
in our executive function

2013
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
as it's called, our planning,
our decision making,

2014
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,200
but also how we interpret context,

2015
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,150
what the meaning of a given sensation is.

2016
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,727
And that's extremely powerful.

2017
01:30:11,727 --> 01:30:15,000
I just want to remind
everybody that the currency

2018
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,010
of the brain and body has not changed

2019
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:18,690
in hundreds of thousands of years.

2020
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,010
It's always been dopamine,
serotonin, glutamate,

2021
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:23,350
GABA, testosterone, estrogen.

2022
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:25,600
What's changed are the contingencies,

2023
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,050
the events in the world
that drive whether or not

2024
01:30:28,050 --> 01:30:31,110
we get an increase or decrease
in testosterone or estrogen,

2025
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:33,440
the events in the world
that dictate whether or not

2026
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,050
we get an increase or
a decrease in dopamine.

2027
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:38,760
Believe me, the events
that drove those increases

2028
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,090
and decreases were very
different even a 100 years ago

2029
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:42,470
than they are now.

2030
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,910
And as we create new things and
societies change, et cetera,

2031
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:50,430
they will continue to exchange information

2032
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:53,010
in the same currency, which
is dopamine, serotonin,

2033
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:55,450
and all these other
neuromodulators and chemicals.

2034
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,629
Hypnosis takes advantage of this

2035
01:30:57,629 --> 01:31:02,040
by allowing an individual,
you, if you like

2036
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,610
to change the way that you
interpret particular events

2037
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:06,990
and to actually experience
what would be painful

2038
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:09,180
as less painful or not painful.

2039
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:10,540
And that's just the example of pain.

2040
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,900
Hypnosis is powerful
for other reasons too.

2041
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,680
It actually can help
rewire neural circuits

2042
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,160
so that you don't experience as much pain

2043
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,210
so that you can sleep
faster, focus faster.

2044
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:23,520
If this is all sounding very fantastical

2045
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,113
well, it's supported by data.

2046
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,070
The data are that when
people do self-hypnosis

2047
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:33,260
even brief self-hypnosis
of 10 or 15 minutes,

2048
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,670
a few times a week, maybe
even returned to that hypnosis

2049
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:39,370
by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,

2050
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:43,380
they can achieve significant
and often very impressive

2051
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,210
degrees of pain relief in chronic pain

2052
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,760
whether or not that chronic pain arises

2053
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,660
through things like fibromyalgia
or through other sources.

2054
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,150
If you want to check this out,

2055
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:54,190
there's a wonderful zero cost resource

2056
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:56,240
that's grounded in this work.

2057
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,200
It's the app reveri.com.

2058
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,198
So R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

2059
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:05,980
There you can download a zero cost app

2060
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,340
for Apple phones or for Android phones.

2061
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:12,680
And there are a variety of
different hypnosis scripts.

2062
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,280
These are actually self hypnosis scripts,

2063
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,170
and you'll actually hear Dr.
David Spiegel talking to you.

2064
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,680
He can teach you about
hypnosis and how it works.

2065
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,468
There are links to scientific studies

2066
01:32:21,468 --> 01:32:24,930
that web address that I
gave you before reveri.com.

2067
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:27,290
You can see the various studies
and the various write-ups

2068
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,560
related to those studies
and how this all works.

2069
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,926
And they're simple protocols.

2070
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:33,790
You just click on a tab and
you listen to the self-hypnosis

2071
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:36,180
and it will take you into hypnosis.

2072
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:39,370
And several of those hypnosis
grips have been shown

2073
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:44,240
clinically to relieve certain
patterns of chronic pain.

2074
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,630
So it's a powerful tool,
and I encourage you not

2075
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:50,010
to write off the non-drug
non supplement tools

2076
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:53,270
as less than powerful
because indeed many people

2077
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:55,290
experience tremendous relief from them.

2078
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:57,850
And of course, they also can be combined

2079
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,170
with drug treatments
if that's right for you

2080
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:03,240
or with supplements and things
of that sort to treat pain,

2081
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,720
if that's right for you.

2082
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:08,890
So again, electroacupuncture
now often supported

2083
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:11,220
by insurance, not always, but often.

2084
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,890
Great mechanistic data starting to emerge.

2085
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:17,320
Hypnosis, terrific tool.

2086
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,970
There's even the self-hypnosis
tool that one can access

2087
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:21,980
through the zero cost app Reveri

2088
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:24,960
and lots of great clinical data

2089
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,680
and scientific mechanistic data.

2090
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,160
There are neuro imaging studies showing

2091
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,237
that different brain areas
are activated in hypnosis

2092
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:32,370
the so-called default network,

2093
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:35,210
kind of where your brains is kind of idols

2094
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:38,020
and the different circuits
that are active in at rest

2095
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,250
shift with hypnosis and shift long-term

2096
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,380
in ways that positively conserve you.

2097
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:45,240
And then these things like
laser photobiomodulation

2098
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,710
still more or less in that
experimental medical community.

2099
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:51,380
I should say, Western Medical
Community, not so certain,

2100
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:53,570
but hopefully there will be data soon,

2101
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:55,960
and hopefully those data
will point to mechanisms

2102
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,410
that allow the insurance companies

2103
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:03,350
and other sort of medical
bodies to support them

2104
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:06,090
if indeed they have a mechanistic basis.

2105
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:09,430
I just want to briefly touch on
a common method of pain relief

2106
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:12,180
that speaks to a more general principle

2107
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,440
of how things like electroacupuncture,

2108
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,160
and also some of these
new emerging techniques

2109
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,020
of kind of like active tissue release

2110
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,870
and this principle that
you hear a lot about

2111
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:24,210
in sports medicine now that
when you have pain or injury

2112
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:26,680
at one site, that you
should provide pressure

2113
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,030
above and below that site.

2114
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,810
You may have seen this in the
Olympics, which is ongoing now

2115
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:34,720
where people will put tape on their body

2116
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,509
at certain locations oftentimes.

2117
01:34:36,509 --> 01:34:39,960
The logic or what they're
saying is that this is designed

2118
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,240
to create relief in a joint or in a limb

2119
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:46,920
that's below the tape, not
necessarily under the tape,

2120
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,220
but above or below.

2121
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,060
So for instance, if there's
pain in one shoulder,

2122
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:53,040
sometimes we'll put it
on the trapezius muscle

2123
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:53,873
or things of that sort.

2124
01:34:53,873 --> 01:34:56,030
It turns out that there
is a basis for this

2125
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:58,730
because of the way that
these different nerves run in

2126
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:02,680
from the skin and from the
muscles up into the spinal cord

2127
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,330
and into the brainstem providing pressure

2128
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:07,960
on one nerve pathway can
often impact another pathway.

2129
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,810
And the simplest and most
common example of this is one

2130
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:13,020
that we all do
instinctually or intuitively

2131
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,820
even animals do this.

2132
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:17,740
This is something that in the
textbooks is all is called

2133
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:20,610
the Gate Theory of Pain
developed by Melzack and Wall

2134
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:22,370
kind of classic theory.

2135
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:26,000
Basically we have receptors in our skin,

2136
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,370
the so-called C fibers, that's just a name

2137
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:30,250
for these little wires that come

2138
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,840
from a particular class
of DRGs that's very thin

2139
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,840
that brings about certain kinds

2140
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,500
of nasal scepter information.

2141
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,840
I want to say pain information,

2142
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:42,230
but then the pain people believe
are not their pain people.

2143
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:44,500
Sometimes they're a pain
because what they tell me

2144
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,900
is they're on pain
receptors okay, nociceptors

2145
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,360
That information comes in C fibers

2146
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:53,940
and what happens when we injure something

2147
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,370
well, provided that we won't
damage it worse by touching it,

2148
01:35:57,370 --> 01:36:01,420
oftentimes what we will do is
we will rub the source of pain

2149
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:05,470
or the location in which
we were experiencing pain.

2150
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:10,470
And it turns out that's not
an unuseful thing to do.

2151
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:14,380
When we rub our skin or an area,

2152
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,550
or we provide pressure nearby it,

2153
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:18,380
we activate the so-called A fibers,

2154
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:22,120
the bigger wires and
neurons that innovate,

2155
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:24,550
meaning they jut into that area of skin.

2156
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,470
And those A fibers, the ones that respond

2157
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:31,210
to mechanical pressure
actually are able to inhibit

2158
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,310
those C fibers, the ones that are carrying

2159
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:35,170
that so-called pain information.

2160
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:38,920
So rubbing an area or providing
pressure above or below

2161
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,990
an injury actually provides
real pain relief support

2162
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:46,770
for the location of
that injury or that pain

2163
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:49,070
because of the way that
these different patterns

2164
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:51,600
or these different types
of neurons interact

2165
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,500
with one another.

2166
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,810
And when I say it inhibits it,

2167
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,493
I don't mean that it like shouts at it,

2168
01:36:55,493 --> 01:36:58,340
what it does is it releases
it's literally kind of

2169
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:01,340
like vomits up a little
bit of a neurotransmitter

2170
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,280
called GABA.

2171
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,960
And GABA is a
neurotransmitter that inhibits

2172
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,210
it quiets the activity of other neurons.

2173
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:11,890
And so it's acting as kind
of an analgesic, if you will,

2174
01:37:11,890 --> 01:37:15,690
it's acting as its own
form of drug that you make

2175
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:19,090
with your body to quiet the
activity of these pain neurons.

2176
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:21,300
So rubbing a wound
provided it doesn't damage

2177
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:25,340
the wound worse or providing
pressure above or below

2178
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,290
typically it's above a particular injury

2179
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:30,760
can have a real effect in
relieving some of the pain

2180
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:31,593
of that injury.

2181
01:37:31,593 --> 01:37:34,060
And some people have speculated
this as through fascia,

2182
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:37,000
or this is through other
bodily organs and tissues.

2183
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,360
And it might be we're going to
do a whole episode on fascia.

2184
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,150
It's extremely interesting tissue,

2185
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:43,140
but right now it seems
that the main source

2186
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:47,460
of that pain relief is through
this A fiber inhibition

2187
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:50,840
of these C fibers
so-called Melzack and Wall

2188
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,020
Gate Theory of Pain if
you'd like to look it up

2189
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,170
and learn about that further.

2190
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:56,950
Now, let's talk about a phenomenon

2191
01:37:56,950 --> 01:38:00,080
that has long intrigued
and perplexed people

2192
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,610
for probably thousands of years.

2193
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:05,190
And that's redheads.

2194
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:07,760
You may have heard before that
redheads have a higher pain

2195
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,060
threshold than other individuals.

2196
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,271
And indeed, that is true.

2197
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:16,090
There's now a study that
looked at this mechanistically.

2198
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:20,600
There's a gene called the MC1R gene.

2199
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,990
And this MC1R gene encodes

2200
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:25,470
for a number of different proteins.

2201
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:27,780
Some of those proteins
of course are related

2202
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,360
to the production of melanin.

2203
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,680
This is why redheads often not always,

2204
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,750
but often are very fair skinned.

2205
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,850
Sometimes have freckles, not always.

2206
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:37,510
And of course have red hair.

2207
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:40,100
Some people are really intense ginger's

2208
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:43,840
not psychologically or emotionally
intense perhaps that too,

2209
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,140
but meaning their hair is very, very red.

2210
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,460
Others, it's a lighter red.

2211
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:50,590
So of course there's
variation here, but this gene,

2212
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:55,590
this MC1R gene is associated
with a pathway that relates

2213
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,880
to something that I've talked
about on this podcast before

2214
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,880
during the episode on hunger
and feeding and this is POMC.

2215
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:08,500
POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin

2216
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,240
and POMC is cut up.

2217
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,420
It's cleaved into different hormones,

2218
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:16,720
including one that
enhances pain perception.

2219
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,360
This is melanocyte stimulating hormone.

2220
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,150
And another one that
blocks pain beta endorphin.

2221
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:25,760
Now, if you listen to the
episodes on testosterone

2222
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,300
and estrogen and the episodes
on hunger and feeding,

2223
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:32,230
some of these molecules
will start to ring a bell.

2224
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:34,520
Things like melano
stimulating hormone relate

2225
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,970
to pigmentation of the skin

2226
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,240
relate to sexual arousal, et cetera,

2227
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,333
but it turns out that in red heads,

2228
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:43,500
because of the fact that
they have this gene,

2229
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:48,500
this MC1R gene, the POMC
Pro-opiomelanocortin,

2230
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,310
that's cut into different hormones,

2231
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:52,950
melanocyte-stimulating hormones

2232
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:56,040
and another one beta endorphin.

2233
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,410
Beta endorphin should cue you to the fact

2234
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,020
that this is in the pain pathway.

2235
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,660
The endorphins are endogenously made,

2236
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:06,540
meaning made within our body opioids.

2237
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,920
They actually make us feel numb

2238
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,460
in response to certain kinds of pain.

2239
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:12,820
Now, not completely numb,

2240
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:17,000
but they numb or reduce
our perception of pain

2241
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,470
because of the ways in
which they are released

2242
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:20,870
from certain brain centers.

2243
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:23,340
We'll talk about those
brain centers in a moment.

2244
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:27,500
So what's really interesting
is that this study showed

2245
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:31,520
that the presence of these
hormones is in everybody.

2246
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,420
We all have melanocortin 4,
we all have beta endorphins.

2247
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,600
We all have POMC et cetera,

2248
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,730
but red heads make more of
these endogenous endorphins.

2249
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:42,830
And that's interesting.

2250
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:46,160
It allows them to buffer
against the pain response.

2251
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,590
I have a personal anecdote
to share with you about

2252
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:50,920
this red head and heightened levels

2253
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,910
of pain tolerance phenomenon.

2254
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,590
Obviously I'm not a redhead.

2255
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:58,210
I don't dye my hair, but
my partner for many years

2256
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:00,560
was a red head and still is a red head.

2257
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,253
She had bright red hair and
had that since childhood.

2258
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,249
Well, we had the fortunate experience

2259
01:41:07,249 --> 01:41:10,930
of becoming friends
with Wim Hof and family.

2260
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:13,290
They actually came out to
visit us and did a series

2261
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:15,530
of seminars in the bay area.

2262
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:18,440
This was in 2016, as I recall.

2263
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:22,780
And my partner, she had
never done an ice bath.

2264
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:25,940
She had never done any kind
of real cold water exposure

2265
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:28,720
experience before, but as
one particular gathering

2266
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,580
as is often the case when women's around,

2267
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,460
there was an ice bath and a
number of people were getting

2268
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,293
into this thing.

2269
01:41:33,293 --> 01:41:34,950
This was actually before a dinner event.

2270
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:38,050
And I think for most people
who have never done an ice bath

2271
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:41,900
getting in for 30 seconds
or a minute is tolerable,

2272
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,180
but it takes some effort.

2273
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,450
It takes some willpower
and take some overcoming

2274
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:47,830
that pain barrier 'cause
it is a little bit painful.

2275
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:48,663
Not a lot.

2276
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:52,770
Some people can stay in longer
three minutes, five minutes

2277
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:54,770
without much discomfort.

2278
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:57,710
What was incredible is
that without any desire

2279
01:41:57,710 --> 01:41:59,470
to compete with anybody else,

2280
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:02,700
my partner redhead got into the ice bath

2281
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,610
and just like sat there for 10 minutes.

2282
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:06,320
In fact, at one point she
just kind of turned to me

2283
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,820
and said, "I don't really feel pain.

2284
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:12,140
I'm not really in pain."

2285
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:13,250
And Wim loved this.

2286
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,190
Wim thought it was great.

2287
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:15,558
He thought it was the most
terrific thing in the world.

2288
01:42:15,558 --> 01:42:17,240
And he got back in the ice bath

2289
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:18,507
and they became fast friends,

2290
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,840
and I think they're
probably still fast friends.

2291
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,330
So in any event, that's an end of one.

2292
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:25,570
What we call an anecdata example.

2293
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:28,250
Anecdata is not really a term
that we should use too much

2294
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,410
'cause it's N of one
anecdotes are just that.

2295
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:32,770
They're just anecdotes.

2296
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:37,068
But it's been described many
times in various clinics

2297
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:41,360
by anesthesiologists, by
observation of coaches, et cetera,

2298
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:45,170
that redheads men and
women who are redheads

2299
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:47,180
seem to have this higher pain threshold.

2300
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:51,100
And it does seem to be because
their body naturally produces

2301
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:53,960
ways to counter the pain response.

2302
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,800
They produce their own endogenous opioids.

2303
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,570
Now this of course should not
be taken to mean that redheads

2304
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:03,060
can tolerate more pain and
therefore should be subjected

2305
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:06,240
to more pain, all it means
is that their threshold

2306
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,500
for pain on average, not all of them,

2307
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,080
but on average is shifted higher

2308
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,000
than that of other individuals.

2309
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,810
And it remains to be
determined whether or not

2310
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:18,490
other light skin, light haired individuals

2311
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:21,000
also have a heightened
level of pain threshold.

2312
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,470
And I should mention because
I mentioned the ice bath

2313
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:26,210
that of course pain threshold is something

2314
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:28,960
that can be built up and
provide you do that safely

2315
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,845
in ways that aren't damaging your tissues

2316
01:43:30,845 --> 01:43:32,950
because of course, pain is a signal

2317
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:36,330
that is designed to help you
to keep from harming yourself,

2318
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:38,610
but provided that you can
do that in a way that's safe

2319
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:41,150
and doesn't damage your tissues,

2320
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:43,360
increasing your pain threshold
through the use of things

2321
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,990
like ice baths is something
that really can be done.

2322
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:48,420
It has a lot to do with these contextual

2323
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:51,410
or top-down modulations of the experience.

2324
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:55,080
You can tell yourself
that this is good for me,

2325
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,410
or I'm doing this by
choice or whatever it is.

2326
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:58,480
You can distract yourself.

2327
01:43:58,480 --> 01:43:59,960
There are a huge number of different ways

2328
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,160
that one could do that.

2329
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,240
One of the more interesting ways

2330
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:06,080
for which there are actually
really good scientific data

2331
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,870
come from my colleagues,
Sean Mackey's Lab.

2332
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:12,900
And that actually looked at
how love and in particular,

2333
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:17,480
the experience of obsessive
love could actually counter

2334
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:21,440
the pain response, not just
in redheads, but in everybody.

2335
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,670
So that study I'll just briefly describe

2336
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,680
it involved having people
come into the laboratory

2337
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,790
and experience any one or a number

2338
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:30,620
of different painful stimuli,

2339
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:33,410
but they had selectively
recruited subjects

2340
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:35,270
that were in new relationships

2341
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:38,120
for which there was a
high degree of infatuation

2342
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,710
so much so that the people
couldn't stop thinking about

2343
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:43,660
or communicating with that new partner

2344
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:47,263
up to 80% of their waking
time, which is a lot.

2345
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:51,600
That constant obsessing about that partner

2346
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,760
was correlated with.

2347
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,230
It wasn't causal necessarily,
but was correlated with

2348
01:44:56,230 --> 01:44:59,430
the ability to sustain
higher levels of pain

2349
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:03,810
than people who were in
more typical non obsessive

2350
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:07,450
forms of love, longstanding relationships,

2351
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:10,530
where there wasn't long
obsessive love rather.

2352
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:12,090
And of course in this study,

2353
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:14,000
there were a lot of good control groups.

2354
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,030
They included a distractor,

2355
01:45:16,030 --> 01:45:18,820
they included people
obsessing about other things,

2356
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:19,760
their pet, et cetera.

2357
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,427
They included other forms
of love and attachment,

2358
01:45:23,427 --> 01:45:26,420
but it does seem that
certain patterns of thinking

2359
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,060
can allow us to buffer ourselves
against the pain response.

2360
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,560
And that should not be surprising.

2361
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,100
Certain forms of thinking are
associated with the release

2362
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,520
of particular neuromodulators
in particular dopamine.

2363
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,772
And dopamine, it may
seem is kind of the thing

2364
01:45:41,772 --> 01:45:44,200
that underlies everything, but it's not.

2365
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,850
Dopamine is a molecule that's associated

2366
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:49,770
with novelty expectation,
motivation, and reward.

2367
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:52,240
We talked about this at the
beginning of the episode,

2368
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:56,400
that it's really the molecule
of expectation and motivation

2369
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,760
and hope and excitement
more than it's associated

2370
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,140
with the receival of the reward.

2371
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,870
Well, dopamine is coursing
throughout the brain

2372
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:08,230
at heightened levels and
coursing throughout the body

2373
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:11,190
at heightened levels when we fall in love.

2374
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:13,630
This probably has some adaptive mechanism

2375
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:15,980
that ensure paired bonding between people

2376
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:18,490
or who knows, maybe it ensured not bonding

2377
01:46:18,490 --> 01:46:19,323
to multiple people.

2378
01:46:19,323 --> 01:46:22,939
Nobody really knows how dopamine functions

2379
01:46:22,939 --> 01:46:24,840
in terms of pair bonding,

2380
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,150
but it is known that
when people fall in love,

2381
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:31,660
new relationships create
very high levels of dopamine.

2382
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:34,500
And that's probably the mechanistic basis

2383
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,630
by which these people were able
to buffer the pain response

2384
01:46:37,630 --> 01:46:41,360
by thinking about their partner
or this new relationship

2385
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,630
that they're in almost
obsessively or obsessively.

2386
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:46,470
Now that raises a deeper question

2387
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:47,430
we should always be asking.

2388
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:48,730
Yeah, but how, how?

2389
01:46:48,730 --> 01:46:52,900
Well, the dopamine system
can have powerful effects

2390
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,640
on the inflammation system.

2391
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:57,100
And it doesn't do this
through mysterious ways.

2392
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:00,280
It does this by interacting
through the brainstem

2393
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:03,300
and some of the neurons
that innervate the spleen

2394
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,450
and other areas of the body,

2395
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:09,274
that deploy cells to go combat infection,

2396
01:47:09,274 --> 01:47:11,350
inflammation, and pain.

2397
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:14,150
And the ways in which
dopamine can modulate pain,

2398
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:16,374
and in this case, this particular study

2399
01:47:16,374 --> 01:47:18,480
transform our experience of pain.

2400
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,814
Maybe even to something that's pleasureful

2401
01:47:20,814 --> 01:47:22,670
is not mysterious.

2402
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:25,990
It's really through the
activation of brainstem neurons

2403
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:28,820
that communicate with areas of our body,

2404
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:31,530
that deploy things like immune cells.

2405
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:34,214
So for instance, we have
neurons in our brain stem

2406
01:47:34,214 --> 01:47:38,420
that can be modulated by
the release of dopamine

2407
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:41,250
and those neurons in the
brainstem control the release

2408
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:44,410
of immune cells from
tissues like the spleen

2409
01:47:44,410 --> 01:47:45,940
or organs like the spleen.

2410
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:48,840
And those immune cells can
then go combat infection.

2411
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,510
We've heard before that when we're happy,

2412
01:47:50,510 --> 01:47:53,650
we're better able to combat
infection, deal with pain,

2413
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:54,833
deal with all sorts of things

2414
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:57,180
that essentially makes us more resilient.

2415
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:59,800
And that's not because dopamine
is some magic molecule,

2416
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,490
it's because dopamine
affects particular circuits

2417
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:05,600
and tells in a very neuro-biological way

2418
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,820
in a biochemical way tells
those cells and circuits

2419
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,170
that conditions are good.

2420
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:12,070
Despite the fact that
there's pain in the body

2421
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:12,990
conditions are good.

2422
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,520
You're in love or conditions are good.

2423
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,220
You want to be in this experience.

2424
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:19,350
Or conditions are good
this is for a greater cause

2425
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:22,580
that you're fighting or suffering
for some larger purpose.

2426
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,740
So all of that has existed
largely in the realm

2427
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,990
of psychology and even
motivational literature

2428
01:48:26,990 --> 01:48:28,180
in this kind of thing,

2429
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:30,110
but there's a real
mechanistic basis for it.

2430
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:32,770
Dopamine is a molecule that
can bind to receptor sites

2431
01:48:32,770 --> 01:48:34,060
on these brain areas.

2432
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:36,640
Those brain areas can then
modulate the organs and tissues

2433
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:40,010
of the body that can allow
us to lean into challenge.

2434
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:41,620
And those challenges can be infection,

2435
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:45,840
it can be physical pain, it
can be long bouts of effort

2436
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,090
that are required of us.

2437
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:50,260
And I think many people
have described the feeling

2438
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,390
of being newly in love as a
heightened level of energy,

2439
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,670
a capacity do anything.

2440
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:58,400
I mean, the whole concept
of a muse is one in which

2441
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:02,120
some individual or some
thing either imagined or real

2442
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:06,680
enters our life and we
can use that as fuel.

2443
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,930
And that fuel is chemical fuel

2444
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:10,860
and that chemical fuel is dopamine.

2445
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,790
And it really does allow
for more resilience

2446
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:15,770
and can even transform
the experience of pain

2447
01:49:15,770 --> 01:49:17,510
or what would otherwise be pain

2448
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,490
into an experience of pleasure.

2449
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:22,220
So, along those lines,
let's talk about pleasure.

2450
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:24,910
With all the cells and
tissues and machinery related

2451
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:28,540
to pain, you might think
that our entire touch system

2452
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:31,330
is designed to allow us to detect pain

2453
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:33,240
and to avoid tissue damage and well,

2454
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:36,420
a good percentage of
it is devoted to that.

2455
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,450
A good percentage of it is also devoted

2456
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:40,910
to this thing that we call pleasure.

2457
01:49:40,910 --> 01:49:43,300
And that should come as no surprise.

2458
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:46,510
Pleasure isn't just
there for our pleasure.

2459
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:48,320
It serves adaptive role,

2460
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,520
and that adaptive role relates to the fact

2461
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,910
that every species has a primary goal

2462
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:54,850
which is to make more of itself

2463
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,933
otherwise it would go extinct.

2464
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,620
That process of making more
of itself sexual reproduction

2465
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:04,370
is closely associated with the sensation

2466
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:06,090
and the perception of pleasure.

2467
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:10,410
And it's no surprise that not
only is the highest density

2468
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:15,230
of sensory receptors in and
on and around the genitalia,

2469
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:19,130
but the process of
reproduction evokes sensations

2470
01:50:19,130 --> 01:50:22,500
and molecules and perceptions
associated with pleasure.

2471
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,450
And the currency of pleasure exists

2472
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:27,210
in multiple chemical systems

2473
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:29,970
but the primary ones
are the dopamine system,

2474
01:50:29,970 --> 01:50:31,820
which is the anticipation of pleasure

2475
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:37,720
and the work required
to achieve the ability

2476
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,610
to experience that pleasure,
and the serotonin system

2477
01:50:41,610 --> 01:50:44,570
which is more closely related
to the immediate experience

2478
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:45,600
of that pleasure.

2479
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:49,570
And from dopamine and serotonin
stem out other hormones

2480
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:52,230
and molecules, things like oxytocin,

2481
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:53,840
which are associated with pair bonding.

2482
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,040
Oxytocin is more closely associated

2483
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,590
with the serotonin system biochemically

2484
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:01,277
and at the circuit level
meaning the areas of the brain

2485
01:51:01,277 --> 01:51:04,150
and body that manufacture
a lot of serotonin,

2486
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:06,310
usually not always, but
usually contain neurons

2487
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:08,620
that also manufacturer and make use

2488
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,453
of the molecule oxytocin.

2489
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:15,460
Those chemicals together
create sensations of warmth,

2490
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:18,570
of well being, of safety.

2491
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:21,499
The dopamine molecule is
more closely associated

2492
01:51:21,499 --> 01:51:23,903
with hormones like testosterone

2493
01:51:23,903 --> 01:51:26,990
and other molecules involved with pursuit

2494
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:30,540
and further effort in order
to get more of whatever

2495
01:51:30,540 --> 01:51:33,390
could potentially cause
more release of dopamine.

2496
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:35,850
So this is a very broad strokes,

2497
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:39,378
no pun intended description
of the pleasure system.

2498
01:51:39,378 --> 01:51:41,730
There are of course,
other molecules as well.

2499
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:44,430
One in particular that's very interesting

2500
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:45,633
is something called PEA.

2501
01:51:46,818 --> 01:51:49,920
PEA, it stands for Phenethylamine

2502
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,050
sometimes also referred
to as Phenethylamine

2503
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:56,160
depending on who you
are and where you live,

2504
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,040
how you pronounce it
doesn't really matter.

2505
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:03,396
PEA is a molecule, which
is incredibly potent

2506
01:52:03,396 --> 01:52:07,010
at augmenting or increasing the activity

2507
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:09,100
of certain cells and neural circuits

2508
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,580
that relate to the pleasure system.

2509
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:16,150
PEA has purportedly been
thought to be released

2510
01:52:16,150 --> 01:52:18,750
in response to ingestion of
things like certain forms

2511
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:19,830
of dark chocolate.

2512
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:21,810
Some people take it in supplement form.

2513
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:24,080
It's a bit of a stimulant,

2514
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:27,580
but it also seems to heighten
the perception of pleasure

2515
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:30,067
in response to a particular
amount of dopamine

2516
01:52:30,067 --> 01:52:31,470
and or serotonin.

2517
01:52:31,470 --> 01:52:34,500
So for instance, in a kind
of a arbitrary experiment

2518
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,220
and units type example,

2519
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:39,360
if a given experience evokes a particular

2520
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,430
amount of serotonin and dopamine

2521
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:44,170
and gives rise to a subjective
experience of pleasure

2522
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:46,240
of say level three out of 10,

2523
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:50,410
the ingestion of PEA prior to
that experience can increase

2524
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:53,050
the rating of that experience
as more pleasureful.

2525
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:55,650
Maybe a four or a five, or even a six.

2526
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:59,510
And PEA is known to be present in

2527
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:02,040
or I should say it's releases stimulated

2528
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:06,120
by a number of different
compounds, such as dark chocolate,

2529
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,820
certain things like
aspartame and certain people

2530
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:11,580
can actually increase the
amount of PEA released.

2531
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:15,370
Some of these glutamate related
molecules like aspartame

2532
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:17,120
or things are in the glutamate pathway

2533
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,740
can increase PEA release.

2534
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,860
And then some people
will actually take PEA

2535
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:25,340
in supplement form for its
mild stimulant properties

2536
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:29,010
as well as for increasing
the perception of,

2537
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:31,580
or the ability to experience pleasure.

2538
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:32,930
It's not a sledgehammer.

2539
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:35,672
It's not like dopamine itself.

2540
01:53:35,672 --> 01:53:39,310
People that take things
like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA

2541
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:41,850
or drugs of abuse, which I
certainly don't recommend

2542
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:44,760
things like cocaine or amphetamine

2543
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,950
experience tremendous
increases in dopamine,

2544
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:50,563
not so much increases in serotonin.

2545
01:53:51,499 --> 01:53:55,210
Some people will take
serotonin in precursor form

2546
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:57,580
like 5HTP or serotonin itself,

2547
01:53:57,580 --> 01:54:00,400
or they'll take the amino acid
precursor like tryptophan.

2548
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,420
I'm not saying these
things as recommendations

2549
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:04,500
for increasingly one sense of pleasure,

2550
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:07,340
I'm describing them
because of what they do

2551
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:10,010
generally falls into two categories.

2552
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:13,730
The first category is
to raise the foundation,

2553
01:54:13,730 --> 01:54:17,400
what we call the tonic level
of dopamine and serotonin.

2554
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:22,400
So if levels of serotonin
and dopamine are too low,

2555
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:27,500
it becomes almost impossible
to experience pleasure.

2556
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,810
There's a so-called anhedonia.

2557
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,850
This is also described as depression.

2558
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:34,690
Although it needn't be
long-term depression.

2559
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:37,510
So certain drugs like antidepressants

2560
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:42,210
like Wellbutrin Bupropion
as it's commonly called

2561
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:44,310
or the so-called SSRI,

2562
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:48,030
the serotonin selective
re-uptake inhibitors

2563
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:51,097
like Prozac, Zoloft and
similar will increase dopamine

2564
01:54:51,097 --> 01:54:53,300
and serotonin respectively.

2565
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:57,490
They're not increasing the
peaks in those molecules.

2566
01:54:57,490 --> 01:54:59,903
What we call the acute
release of those molecules,

2567
01:54:59,903 --> 01:55:02,780
what they're doing is they're
raising the overall levels

2568
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:03,613
of those molecules.

2569
01:55:03,613 --> 01:55:05,610
They're raising the sort of foundation

2570
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:07,010
or the tide if you will,

2571
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:09,980
think about it as your mood
or your pleasure rather

2572
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:12,390
is like a boat, and if it's on the shore

2573
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:13,790
and it can't get out to sea,

2574
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:15,190
unless that tide is high enough,

2575
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:17,500
that's kind of the way to
think about these tonic levels

2576
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,050
of dopamine and serotonin.

2577
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:20,860
Now, most of us fortunately,

2578
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:25,190
do not have problems with our
baseline or autonic levels

2579
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:26,991
of dopamine and serotonin release.

2580
01:55:26,991 --> 01:55:31,070
Things like PEA in that case
will cause a slight increase

2581
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:36,070
in that tide and make the
ability of certain experiences

2582
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,240
to increase dopamine
further more available.

2583
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:44,130
What we call this in neurosciences
so-called gain control.

2584
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,140
I can kind of turn up the volume,

2585
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:48,000
bring us closer to the threshold

2586
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,580
to activate certain circuits.

2587
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:51,170
And this is really what we mean

2588
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:54,390
when we say a neuromodulator, okay?

2589
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:57,870
This is why when you are
very happy about something,

2590
01:55:57,870 --> 01:55:59,360
let's say you're out with your friends.

2591
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,040
You're really excited.

2592
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,330
Maybe depending on where
you live and what's going on

2593
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:04,730
in your area of the world right now,

2594
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:07,950
like I have a niece and she's
been locked up in quarantine

2595
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:10,270
for a long time recently
because it was deemed safe.

2596
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:11,620
She got to go to summer camp.

2597
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:13,622
I have never seen that kid so happy

2598
01:56:13,622 --> 01:56:16,733
to spend with her friends.

2599
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:20,600
She was so excited and
it was really amazing

2600
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:21,680
to see how excited she was.

2601
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:24,740
Her baseline levels of
dopamine were clearly up

2602
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:28,230
so much so that when she saw her friends,

2603
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:30,600
she literally started squealing.

2604
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:31,970
They were squealing, she was squealing.

2605
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:32,803
Everyone was squealing.

2606
01:56:32,803 --> 01:56:33,790
I wasn't squealing.

2607
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:35,180
I would admit it if I was squealing.

2608
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:37,800
I wasn't squealing, but it
was such a delight to see

2609
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,890
and I'm sure that made
my dopamine levels go up,

2610
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:43,127
which was, she was just so
excited such that anything

2611
01:56:43,127 --> 01:56:45,060
and everything felt like
an exciting stimulus.

2612
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,860
This is pleasure, right?

2613
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:48,650
And I don't want to
write off the experience

2614
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:51,650
from an neuro-biological
reductionist standpoint,

2615
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:52,483
quite the opposite.

2616
01:56:52,483 --> 01:56:55,620
It's really beautiful to
see again this principle

2617
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:59,880
that different experiences
and the experience of pleasure

2618
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,060
from different things.

2619
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:02,450
Seeing your friends for the first time,

2620
01:57:02,450 --> 01:57:04,210
summer camp for a kid,

2621
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:08,070
whatever it might happen to
be use the same currency,

2622
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:11,430
dopamine use the same currency serotonin.

2623
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:13,050
And this is a principle that I hope

2624
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,400
in listening to this podcast

2625
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,190
and even some of it's repetitive features

2626
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,853
from one episode to the next.

2627
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,810
I'm hoping that those will
start to embed in your mind

2628
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:24,140
that the brain and body
use these common currencies

2629
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,580
for different experiences.

2630
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:28,760
So yes, if your dopamine and
serotonin, or I should say

2631
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,810
if your dopamine and or
serotonin levels are too low,

2632
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:34,860
it will be very hard to achieve pleasure

2633
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:37,410
to experience physical
pleasure or emotional pleasure

2634
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:38,700
of any kind.

2635
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,750
That's why treatments of the sort

2636
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:43,770
that I described a minute
ago might be right for you.

2637
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:45,530
Obviously we can't determine
if they're right for you.

2638
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:47,170
It's also why they have side effects.

2639
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:49,930
If you artificially
increase these molecules

2640
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:51,660
they're associated with pleasure,

2641
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:53,990
oftentimes you get a lack of motivation

2642
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:55,410
to go seek things like food.

2643
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:57,207
People don't get much
interest in food 'cause

2644
01:57:57,207 --> 01:58:00,300
why should they if their
serotonin levels are already up.

2645
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,566
Again, there's a ton of
individual variation.

2646
01:58:02,566 --> 01:58:05,140
I don't want to say that
these antidepressants

2647
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:06,380
are always bad.

2648
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,340
Sometimes they've saved lives.

2649
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,670
They've saved millions of lives.

2650
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:10,960
Sometimes people have side effects

2651
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,560
that make them not the right choice.

2652
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,860
So it has to be determined
for the individual.

2653
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:18,690
Things like PEA or a more subtle effect.

2654
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:21,640
I should mention PEA
supplementation is something

2655
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:24,600
that a number of people use
but it's very short-lived.

2656
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,414
Because of the half-life of
this molecule was very brief,

2657
01:58:27,414 --> 01:58:31,312
the effect only lasts
about 20 minutes or so.

2658
01:58:31,312 --> 01:58:34,400
Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens

2659
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:38,860
lead to longer baseline
increases in dopamine.

2660
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:42,140
But remember, any time
you raise a baseline,

2661
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:46,240
you reduce the so-called signal to noise.

2662
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:48,120
What it means is if you're riding around

2663
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:50,210
at really high dopamine, at first,

2664
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:51,830
everything will start to seem exciting

2665
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:53,770
like my niece and seeing her
friends for the first time.

2666
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:54,906
Everything's exciting.

2667
01:58:54,906 --> 01:58:57,510
But then what will happen
is when your dopamine levels

2668
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:59,660
return to more normal levels,

2669
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:02,396
it will take a much
greater dopamine increase

2670
01:59:02,396 --> 01:59:06,060
of much bigger event,
more novel, more exciting

2671
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:09,030
in order to achieve the sense that

2672
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:11,410
what you're experiencing is pleasureful.

2673
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:13,440
And this is because of the relationship

2674
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,460
between pleasure and pain.

2675
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:17,670
Now, in a future episode
we are going to go deep

2676
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:20,360
into this relationship
between pleasure and pain,

2677
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:23,270
but just briefly as a precursor to that

2678
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:25,690
and because it's relevant
to the conversation

2679
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:26,840
that we've been having,

2680
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:31,750
you might want to be
wary of any experience,

2681
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:34,760
any experience, no matter how it arrives,

2682
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:38,520
chemical, physical, emotional,
or some combination,

2683
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,150
you might want to be wary
of letting your dopamine go

2684
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:43,320
too high and certainly you want to be wary

2685
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:44,240
of it going too low.

2686
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:46,580
Because of the way that
these circuits adjust.

2687
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:50,450
Basically every time that the
pleasure system is kicked in

2688
01:59:50,450 --> 01:59:54,220
in high gear, an absolutely
spectacular event,

2689
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:56,603
you cannot be more ecstatic.

2690
01:59:56,603 --> 02:00:01,603
There is a mirror symmetric
activation of the pain system.

2691
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:05,780
And this might seem like
an evil curse of biology,

2692
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,613
but it's not.

2693
02:00:06,613 --> 02:00:09,465
This is actually a way to
protect this whole system

2694
02:00:09,465 --> 02:00:11,820
of reward and motivation
that I talked about

2695
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:14,170
at the beginning of the episode.

2696
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:16,430
It might sound great to
just ingest substances

2697
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:17,470
or engage in behaviors

2698
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:19,120
where it's just dopamine,
dopamine, dopamine,

2699
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:21,480
and just constantly be motivated,

2700
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:24,010
but the system will eventually crash.

2701
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:25,990
And so what happens is when
you have a big increase

2702
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:28,840
in dopamine, you also
will get a big increase

2703
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:32,980
in the circuits that underlie
our sense of disappointment

2704
02:00:32,980 --> 02:00:34,990
and re adjusting the balance.

2705
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:38,040
And with repeated exposure
to high levels of dopamine,

2706
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:40,770
not naturally occurring wonderful events,

2707
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:45,770
but really high chemically
induced peaks in dopamine,

2708
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:49,260
high magnitude, chemically
induced peaks in dopamine.

2709
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,340
What happens is those peaks in dopamine

2710
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:55,210
start to go down and down and
down in response to the same,

2711
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:57,820
what ought to be incredible experience.

2712
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:01,420
We start to what's called
habituate or attenuate,

2713
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:05,850
and yet the pain increases in size.

2714
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:09,540
And this has a preservative
function in keeping us safe,

2715
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,040
believe it or not.

2716
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,380
But what I just described
is actually the basis

2717
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:16,150
of most if not all, forms of addiction

2718
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:17,400
something that we will deal with

2719
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,410
in a future episode in depth.

2720
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:20,860
So what should you think about all?

2721
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:21,950
How should you think about pleasure

2722
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:23,400
and how should you think about pain?

2723
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:25,270
What is too much pleasure?

2724
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:28,860
Well, that's going to differ
from person to person,

2725
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:33,420
but to the extent that one
can access pleasure repeatedly

2726
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:37,680
over time, ideally without
chemical augmentation,

2727
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:40,050
certainly not excessive
chemical augmentation,

2728
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:42,700
that means that this pleasure
system is tuned up well

2729
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:44,500
and can continue to experience pleasure.

2730
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:47,580
However, if you find yourself engaging

2731
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:50,120
in the same behavior over and over again,

2732
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,920
but achieving less and
less pleasure from it,

2733
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:56,360
chances are you want to adjust down

2734
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:58,963
how often you engage in that behavior.

2735
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:04,430
And or adjust down your
expectation of reward

2736
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:06,623
every time you engage in that behavior.

2737
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:08,950
What do I mean by that?

2738
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:10,360
Well, at the beginning of the episode

2739
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:14,230
I talked about how dopamine
will allow us to get

2740
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:15,820
into bouts of hard work.

2741
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:18,940
We will work very hard to pursue a reward,

2742
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:20,440
and that's really what dopamine does.

2743
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:21,840
And then when the reward comes

2744
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:24,070
that doesn't increase our dopamine.

2745
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:26,243
In fact, our dopamine levels go down.

2746
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,610
One of the key things that we can all do

2747
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:34,310
to adjust our ability
to experience pleasure

2748
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:38,890
is to engage in that
intermittent reward schedule.

2749
02:02:38,890 --> 02:02:41,620
You can either adjust
down the peak in dopamine,

2750
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,480
meaning not let yourself
ever get too happy,

2751
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:44,580
but that's no fun, right?

2752
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:47,820
Life is about occasionally achieving

2753
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:49,610
or experiencing ecstasy,

2754
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:52,860
but every once in a
while, remove the reward.

2755
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:54,320
And of course, I don't
mean ecstasy the drug

2756
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:55,210
that's a separate matter.

2757
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:56,970
The MDMA trials are a separate matter.

2758
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:58,210
Very interesting, I want to be clear.

2759
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:01,290
I meant psychological and physical ecstasy

2760
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:03,230
of the natural sort.

2761
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:06,960
I've immense interest in what's
going on in the MDMA trials,

2762
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,400
but just for clarity purposes,

2763
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,470
that's a separate topic that we will cover

2764
02:03:11,470 --> 02:03:14,390
in an episode very soon.

2765
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:17,290
So how do you adjust this dopamine system?

2766
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:20,060
Well, every once in a while at random,

2767
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:22,660
not in a predictable way,

2768
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:26,550
you remove the reward
and that will keep you

2769
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:30,070
and your dopamine system
tune up in the proper ways.

2770
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:32,640
The gain of the dopamine
system, as we say,

2771
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,930
will be adjusted so that you can continue

2772
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:37,260
to experience dopamine and serotonin

2773
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:38,910
when you actually get the reward.

2774
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:42,900
This can be translated into a huge number

2775
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,950
of different domains,

2776
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:46,380
but I want to give some
examples because I'm sure

2777
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:47,320
that many of you are asking,

2778
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,490
wait, what does this actually mean?

2779
02:03:48,490 --> 02:03:50,260
Okay, let's say you're a student,

2780
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:52,870
or this could be a student in academia,

2781
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:56,220
or this could be a student
of a physical practice.

2782
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:59,113
Every once in a while when
you do something really well,

2783
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:02,580
maybe that's even just
showing up to the practice

2784
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:04,752
rather than pat yourself on the back,

2785
02:04:04,752 --> 02:04:07,070
just tell yourself
yeah, that's the minimum

2786
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:08,150
that's expected of me.

2787
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:10,620
When everyone's excited about
something that you're doing,

2788
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,120
maybe you're excited about it,

2789
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:14,860
try and adjust down your
excitement a little bit.

2790
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:16,910
I know this might seem counterintuitive,

2791
02:04:16,910 --> 02:04:20,180
but you're preserving the
ability to experience excitement

2792
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,980
in a variety of contexts.

2793
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:25,530
Let's say you get a big monetary award.

2794
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:27,750
Well, that's great.

2795
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:28,680
I'm happy for you.

2796
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:30,340
And that's wonderful.

2797
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:32,839
However, you should be a little bit wary

2798
02:04:32,839 --> 02:04:34,800
if you care about your dopamine system

2799
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:35,930
and you care about your ability

2800
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:39,760
to get subsequent monetary
rewards, excuse me,

2801
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:42,580
awards rewards doesn't
matter which through effort,

2802
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:44,580
if you want to be able
to maintain the ability

2803
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:47,130
to exert effort, well,
then you probably wouldn't

2804
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:49,500
want to run out and
immediately buy something

2805
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,200
with that monetary reward.

2806
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:52,650
In other words, you
wouldn't want to layer on

2807
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:55,560
more dopamine release, okay?

2808
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,830
You might, but you might not.

2809
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:59,160
You might skip it.

2810
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,188
What you'll find then
is that your motivation

2811
02:05:01,188 --> 02:05:03,110
is essentially infinite.

2812
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:05,510
This is what I described at
the beginning of the episode.

2813
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:08,710
And again, it's because
dopamine is this currency.

2814
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:10,987
It's like these days you
hear a lot about Bitcoin,

2815
02:05:10,987 --> 02:05:14,540
and Ethereum, and
Dogecoin, and USs dollars,

2816
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:16,740
and Euros and other stuff.

2817
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:20,780
But the currency that you use in your body

2818
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:23,170
doesn't matter what
external currency those are.

2819
02:05:23,170 --> 02:05:24,740
In fact, as you watch the value

2820
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:26,240
of different currencies go up

2821
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:29,100
whether or not it's cryptocurrency
or standard currency,

2822
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:31,610
the value is actually
reflective of the dopamine

2823
02:05:31,610 --> 02:05:33,850
that exists inside of people.

2824
02:05:33,850 --> 02:05:36,450
So all the excitement
about a particular currency

2825
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:39,660
crypto or otherwise is
really just dopamine.

2826
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:42,930
That's the currency that we all use.

2827
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:44,710
And there's no negotiating that.

2828
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:46,790
That's just the way that we're built.

2829
02:05:46,790 --> 02:05:48,830
Now, to give yet other examples.

2830
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:51,140
Let's say you're teaching other
people how to do something

2831
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:53,360
and they do something exceptionally well.

2832
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,770
If you reward them every single time.

2833
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:58,030
and in particular, if you
reward them with something

2834
02:05:58,030 --> 02:06:00,950
that's even greater than the
experience of what they did.

2835
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:02,860
So let's say kids win a soccer game

2836
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:04,140
and they're ecstatic.

2837
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,160
They're jumping all over the place.

2838
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,780
They're super excited and you reward them

2839
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:10,950
with an even bigger
experience, a celebration,

2840
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:14,550
you are actually inhibiting their ability

2841
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:17,680
to perform the same set of activities

2842
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:21,080
that led them to the win if,
and I really want to underscore

2843
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:22,960
if you reward them every time.

2844
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:26,290
Of course we should
reward kids and each other

2845
02:06:26,290 --> 02:06:28,430
and ourselves for our accomplishments,

2846
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:30,820
but you don't want to do it every time.

2847
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:33,030
And sure there will be some disappointment

2848
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:37,890
from suddenly removing the
reward that you expected,

2849
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:39,210
but that's exactly the point.

2850
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:41,860
That's what keeps these
circuits tuned up properly.

2851
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,340
Now there's the other form of pleasure,

2852
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:47,080
which is the more immediate visceral

2853
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:49,270
or sensory experience of pleasure.

2854
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:51,760
This is distinct from goals
and goal-directed behavior.

2855
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:53,350
I'm talking about the
immediate experience.

2856
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:55,830
This is more of the serotonergic system.

2857
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:57,600
There are other systems involved too,

2858
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:58,750
but this is also the system

2859
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:02,890
that draws out those endogenous opioids

2860
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:04,140
from a particular structure.

2861
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:06,510
We have a structure in the
back of our brain called PAG

2862
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:10,040
P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area.

2863
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:13,340
Very interesting brain area
that is associated with pain,

2864
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:16,500
but also with pleasure because
under certain conditions,

2865
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:20,006
it deploys endogenous opioids and gives us

2866
02:07:20,006 --> 02:07:22,300
a kind of blissed out feeling.

2867
02:07:22,300 --> 02:07:25,630
This is not like the opioids
of the opioid epidemic sort

2868
02:07:25,630 --> 02:07:27,715
that people take and
unfortunately have led

2869
02:07:27,715 --> 02:07:30,490
to tremendous amounts
of suffering and abuse.

2870
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:33,000
These are endogenously released opioids.

2871
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,430
These are the kinds of
opioids that come out

2872
02:07:34,430 --> 02:07:38,090
from long distance bouts of
physical exercise and running.

2873
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:40,170
These are the opioids that are deployed

2874
02:07:40,170 --> 02:07:42,300
in response to giving birth

2875
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:45,830
and overcoming the tremendous
pain of childbirth.

2876
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:50,090
So PAG is very contextual
and there are few types

2877
02:07:50,090 --> 02:07:53,840
of stimuli or I should
say events in life...

2878
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:55,310
I'm really showing my nerdy side.

2879
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:56,780
There are a few types of stimulate,

2880
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:00,790
I'm talking about experiences
that evoke endogenous opioid

2881
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:02,300
release from PAG.

2882
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:05,050
One is sexual activity.

2883
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:08,430
Sexual activity can
increase pain threshold.

2884
02:08:08,430 --> 02:08:12,850
And here I am not suggesting
or getting involved

2885
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:15,550
in anyone's particular proclivities
or personal experiences.

2886
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:18,060
You're welcome to editorialize
this however you like,

2887
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:21,230
however, what I'm talking
about are animal data

2888
02:08:21,230 --> 02:08:23,230
and yes, human data as well,

2889
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:25,300
that show that pain
thresholds are increased

2890
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:28,450
anytime PAG is activated
because of the release

2891
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:30,173
of these endogenous opioids.

2892
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:35,070
There's also the immediate experience

2893
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:37,260
of whether or not a
particular form of touch

2894
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,820
is pleasureful or not.

2895
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:40,780
And there there's some
very interesting biology

2896
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,470
that relates to really
how those little wires

2897
02:08:43,470 --> 02:08:45,543
from those DRGs innovate our skin.

2898
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:50,430
Work studies I should say
done by David Ginty's lab

2899
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:51,540
at Harvard Medical School,

2900
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:54,200
the Ginty lab has spent years working

2901
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,570
on the somata sensory
system, the touch system

2902
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:00,420
has identified a particular
category of neurons

2903
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:01,769
that innervate the skin
and then those neurons

2904
02:09:01,769 --> 02:09:04,660
of course send that information
up to the brain too.

2905
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:08,460
And they actually respond
to direction of touch.

2906
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:10,270
Now, some of you might be more sensitive

2907
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:13,120
to this than others, but it turns out that

2908
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:17,853
certain hairs like to be
deflected one way versus another.

2909
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:22,040
Whether you like cats or not,
you can do this experiment.

2910
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:25,160
You can pet a cat in the
direction that they're fur lies.

2911
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,780
So it lies down in a particular direction.

2912
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:28,090
You'll notice that there's actually a gene

2913
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:29,720
that dictates that the hairs lie down

2914
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,830
in a particular direction.

2915
02:09:30,830 --> 02:09:33,830
And if you pet them in a way that's

2916
02:09:36,330 --> 02:09:38,130
co-operating with that direction.

2917
02:09:38,130 --> 02:09:39,370
So not pushing the hairs up,

2918
02:09:39,370 --> 02:09:42,580
but rather stroking the
hairs on the back of the cat.

2919
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:44,100
Well, you'll notice as
they often like that.

2920
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:45,910
Not all cats some cats are pretty grouchy,

2921
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:48,280
but if you stroke their hair,

2922
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:51,310
they will often per,
they'll often push into you.

2923
02:09:51,310 --> 02:09:53,860
If you were to stroke their
hair in the opposite direction,

2924
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:56,220
pushing the hairs up against the direction

2925
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:59,227
that they want to lie down,
cats do not like that.

2926
02:09:59,227 --> 02:10:01,170
And it turns out that people
don't like that either.

2927
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:03,080
Some people do like to
have their hair pushed

2928
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:05,270
in a direction against the direction

2929
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,060
in which it wants to lay down.

2930
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:10,800
But there is more typically response

2931
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,250
a feeling like it's
pleasureful for instance,

2932
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,860
when someone brushes or combs their hair

2933
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:16,430
in the direction that
it wants to lay down.

2934
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:19,210
And that's because the way
in which these neurons,

2935
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:22,160
they innovate these hairs
sends information up

2936
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,840
to the brain bifurcates actually,

2937
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,780
it splits into brain centers

2938
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:28,550
that evoke a sense of pleasure
or a sense of not pleasure.

2939
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:30,170
It's not necessarily pain.

2940
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:34,060
So you might find that certain
people are very particular.

2941
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:36,240
They like to be touched in a
certain way, but not others.

2942
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:37,880
You might be one of those people.

2943
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,430
And areas of our skin
that have high density

2944
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:45,430
of receptors are very, very
sensitive in a real way,

2945
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:49,640
in a real sense of the
word to patterns of touch

2946
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:53,730
and whether or not a touch
is too firm or too light.

2947
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:58,600
And that will be modulated
by overall levels of arousal.

2948
02:10:58,600 --> 02:10:59,820
And when I talk about arousal,

2949
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:02,510
what I'm talking about is how
alert or how sleep we are.

2950
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:05,320
It is impossible to experience pain

2951
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:07,660
when we are deep in sleep.

2952
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:09,650
I don't mean sleeping like
of the typical night's sort.

2953
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:10,850
I mean, of the anesthesia sort.

2954
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:13,400
That's the purpose of anesthesia
to bring the brain and body

2955
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:16,810
into a deep plane of
rest, very deep in fact,

2956
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:21,210
and it's very hard if
not impossible to achieve

2957
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:24,750
or experience pleasure when
we are in a very low state

2958
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:26,370
of arousal as well.

2959
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:29,120
When we are in heightened
states of arousal,

2960
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:32,160
we can achieve pain,
we can experience pain

2961
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:34,063
and we can experience pleasure.

2962
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:37,573
And under those heightened
states of arousal,

2963
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:40,020
we are more sensitive.

2964
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:43,120
Literally the passage
of electrical signals

2965
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:45,230
from those locations on the body

2966
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:48,670
that have heightened degrees
or higher degrees, I should say

2967
02:11:48,670 --> 02:11:51,190
of receptors, use your imagination.

2968
02:11:51,190 --> 02:11:53,590
They include the lips, the
face, the feet, and the genitals

2969
02:11:53,590 --> 02:11:56,763
and nearby areas, literally nearby areas.

2970
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,660
Under conditions of higher
arousal two things happen,

2971
02:12:01,660 --> 02:12:04,090
the ability to achieve
or experience pleasure

2972
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:05,970
at those locations goes up

2973
02:12:05,970 --> 02:12:09,440
and our tolerance and our
threshold for pain also goes up.

2974
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:12,760
So the principle here is that
as our levels of arousal,

2975
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:15,540
that foundation of
arousal goes up or down,

2976
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:18,390
so too goes up and down our ability

2977
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:20,370
to achieve pleasure and pain.

2978
02:12:20,370 --> 02:12:22,566
And so these two extremes of
being deep within anesthesia

2979
02:12:22,566 --> 02:12:26,410
or another extreme as asleep

2980
02:12:26,410 --> 02:12:28,760
or an heightened levels of arousal,

2981
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,460
our ability to achieve pleasure and pain

2982
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:32,580
are going to scale according to those.

2983
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:35,260
And this is why, and I'm
certainly not suggesting this,

2984
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:38,890
but this is why some
people will take stimulants

2985
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:41,070
or drugs of abuse that increase arousal

2986
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:44,260
in order to achieve
pleasure of other kinds.

2987
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:46,590
The problem is is that
those drugs in particular

2988
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:49,810
are things like cocaine and
methamphetamine and amphetamine

2989
02:12:49,810 --> 02:12:51,960
become their own form of reinforcement

2990
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:56,150
so much so that the
person doesn't seek out

2991
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:59,023
any other form of excitement or arousal.

2992
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:02,850
So today we weren't
talking about addiction.

2993
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:05,010
We weren't necessarily
talking about motivation,

2994
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:07,270
but we touched on those
topics as sort of a precursor

2995
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:08,910
of what's to come.

2996
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:11,780
We talked about the pathways
in the skin and in the brain

2997
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,230
and elsewhere in the body

2998
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:15,020
that control our sense
of pleasure and pain.

2999
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:17,270
We described a number of
different tools ranging

3000
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:19,110
from hypnosis to different supplements,

3001
02:13:19,110 --> 02:13:23,380
to electroacupuncture
and various other tools

3002
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,990
that one could use to modulate your sense

3003
02:13:24,990 --> 02:13:26,740
of pleasure or pain.

3004
02:13:26,740 --> 02:13:28,940
And of course, in thinking about pleasure,

3005
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,137
we have to think about the dopamine system

3006
02:13:30,137 --> 02:13:31,187
and the serotonin system

3007
02:13:31,187 --> 02:13:33,560
and some of the related chemical systems.

3008
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:35,060
I realized that today's podcast

3009
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:37,570
had a lot of scientific details.

3010
02:13:37,570 --> 02:13:39,020
We've timestamped everything for you

3011
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:42,350
so that you don't have to
digest it all at once of course

3012
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:44,040
I don't expect that everyone would be able

3013
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:46,395
to understand all these
details all at once.

3014
02:13:46,395 --> 02:13:49,890
What's more important
really is to understand

3015
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:52,100
the general principles of how something

3016
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:53,690
like pleasure and pain work.

3017
02:13:53,690 --> 02:13:56,390
How they interact, and
the very seldom systems

3018
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:58,780
within the brain and body
that allow them to occur

3019
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:02,470
and that modulator or change
their ability to occur.

3020
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:04,450
And of course your subjective experience

3021
02:14:04,450 --> 02:14:05,720
of pleasure or pain.

3022
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:09,230
So I do hope that this was
on hole more pleasureful

3023
02:14:09,230 --> 02:14:10,600
than painful for you.

3024
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:13,200

3036
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:40,200
There are other ways to
support the podcast as well.

3037
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,953
We have a Patreon that's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

3038
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:45,730
And there you can support the podcast

3039
02:14:45,730 --> 02:14:47,580
at any level that you like.

3040
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:49,450
In addition, please check out our sponsors

3041
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:51,810
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

3042
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:53,750
We only work with sponsors and brands

3043
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:55,970
that we absolutely love their products

3044
02:14:55,970 --> 02:14:57,610
and that we wholeheartedly endorse,

3045
02:14:57,610 --> 02:14:59,080
and that we use ourselves.

3046
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:01,360
In addition, we've partnered with Thorne.

3047
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,940
Thorne as a supplement company,

3048
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,050
and we've partnered with them

3049
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:06,290
because they have the
highest levels of stringency

3050
02:15:06,290 --> 02:15:09,020
in terms of the quality of
the ingredients they use

3051
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:11,570
and the quantity of the
ingredients they use.

3052
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:13,775
By quantity I mean that unlike a lot

3053
02:15:13,775 --> 02:15:15,940
of supplement companies out there,

3054
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:18,800
the amounts that are listed
on the bottle are absolutely

3055
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:22,250
what you find in those capsules
and tablets in the bottle.

3056
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:27,250
If you go to Thorne that's
T-H-O-R-N-E/U/Huberman,

3057
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:30,930
you can see the supplements that I take

3058
02:15:30,930 --> 02:15:33,800
and you can get 20% off
any of those supplements

3059
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:36,770
as well as any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes.

3060
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:38,960
Just go into the Thorne
site through that portal,

3061
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:43,410
thorne/u/huberman and
even if you navigate off

3062
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:45,130
from that location in the site,

3063
02:15:45,130 --> 02:15:47,880
you'll get 20% off any of the
items that you might select

3064
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,940
from other locations
within the Thorne site.

3065
02:15:49,940 --> 02:15:52,500
If you're not already
following us on Instagram,

3066
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:54,690
it's Huberman Lab at Instagram,

3067
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:58,260
and there I do various
tutorials about neuroscience,

3068
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:01,650
offer neuroscience related
tools all backed by science.

3069
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:02,940
And last but not least,

3070
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:04,560
I thank you for your time and attention

3071
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,300
and thank you for your
interest in science.
