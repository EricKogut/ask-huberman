1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,920
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,138
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:09,390
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,410
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,410
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,330
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,970
Today, we are going to
discuss your brain chemistry

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,850
and how to control and
optimize your brain chemistry

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,860
for all aspects of mental health,

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,140
physical health, and performance.

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,570
Many times before on the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,840
and frankly, every time I'm
a guest on another podcast,

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,720
I get questions about science
and science-based tools

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,580
for things like enhancing sleep,

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,780
enhancing focus,

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,950
enhancing creativity,

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,090
improving relationships,

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,520
getting over grief and on and on,

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,260
all of which are valid questions

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,020
and for which there are protocols
that are based in science

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,350
and that work the first
time and every time.

23
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,350
However far more important
than knowing a protocol

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,050
is understanding why a
given protocol works.

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,000
That's why I'm always
hammering on mechanism

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
and explaining the cells
and circuits and chemicals,

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,110
at least to some detail,

28
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,110
so that people can understand
not just what to do,

29
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,970
but why it works and therefore,

30
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,740
how to change a protocol

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,570
as their life circumstances change,

32
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,310
or as goals change.

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,190
Now today we are going to
go even a layer deeper.

34
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,200
We're going to explore the foundations

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,200
of your biology in your brain and body

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,390
that allow any protocol to work

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,040
because as it turns out,

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,480
all of the protocols out there,

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,100
whether or not it's a breathing protocol

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,800
or a supplement or a prescription drug

41
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,630
or an exercise routine,

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,570
they all tap into and leverage

43
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,350
a core set of just a few
biological mechanisms.

44
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,183
That's right,

45
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,460
beneath everything you
are able to do and feel

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,220
and indeed beneath every
protocol that allows you

47
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,690
to change for the better

48
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,160
and optimize your mental health,

49
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,900
physical health, and performance,

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,910
there's just a small subset of chemicals

51
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,670
that you're leveraging toward that change.

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,900
So today we are going to talk

53
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,750
about the four major
pillars of neurochemistry

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,790
that allow you to, for instance,

55
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,710
be focused when you want to focus,

56
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,910
that allow you to relax

57
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,800
when you need to relax and de-stress,

58
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,960
that allow you to optimize your sleep,

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,020
that allow you to optimize
your exercise routine

60
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,750
or to work through a pain
point in relationship

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,930
or in career or in your
relationship to yourself.

62
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,100
So what I can say for sure

63
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,380
is that by the end of this episode,

64
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
you will have a much richer understanding

65
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,180
about how your brain and nervous system

66
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,250
and indeed your entire body work.

67
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,680
And you'll have a much
firmer understanding

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,770
as to which protocols
and tools to reach for

69
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,740
given your particular goals in the moment,

70
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,740
in the day, across the
week, across the month,

71
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,770
across the year, and indeed
across your entire lifespan.

72
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,440
So what we're really going
for today are principles,

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,340
deeper understanding of why
any given protocol works

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,520
and we are also going to
discuss specific protocols.

75
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,380
Some of those protocols I've discussed

76
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,110
on previous episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

77
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,340
but I must say,

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,500
many of the protocols and
tools that I will discuss

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,510
are brand new and based on research

80
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,160
that I have not discussed at all,

81
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,520
simply because the research
papers came out only recently,

82
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,820
or these are papers that
I only recently unearthed.

83
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,340
In fact, I'm going to share
with you two recent studies

84
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,160
in a moment that are exceedingly important

85
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,660
for optimizing your sleep

86
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,370
and these are studies that, again,

87
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,520
I've never discussed
in any episode on sleep

88
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,870
or on any other podcast.

89
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,310
So by the end of today's episode,

90
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,660
you're going to have far more knowledge

91
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,420
about your biology and psychology
than you did at the start

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,460
and you'll be armed with many more tools

93
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,690
and most importantly,

94
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,730
principles so that you can navigate

95
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,160
not just the tools
presented on this podcast,

96
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,800
but in the vast landscape
of tools that are out there

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,470
for mental health, physical
health and performance.

98
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,420
The Huberman Lab Podcast
is proud to announce

99
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,670
that we've partnered with
Momentous supplements.

100
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,960
We've done that for several reasons.

101
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,793
First of all,

102
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,530
the quality of their
supplements is exceedingly high.

103
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,490
Second of all,

104
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,380
we wanted to have a location
where you could find

105
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,930
all of the supplements discussed
on the Huberman Lab Podcast

106
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,880
in one easy to find place.

107
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,230
You can now find that place
at livemomentous.com/huberman.

108
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,590
In addition, Momentous
supplements ship internationally,

109
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,450
something that a lot of
other supplement companies

110
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,710
simply do not do.

111
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,600
So that's terrific whether
or not you live in the US

112
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,650
or you live abroad.

113
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,450
Right now, not all of the supplements

114
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,300
that we discuss on the Huberman
Lab Podcast are listed,

115
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,950
but that catalog of supplements

116
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,690
is being expanded very rapidly

117
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,430
and a good number of them
that we've talked about,

118
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,830
some of the more prominent
ones for sleep and focus

119
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,080
and other aspects of
mental and physical health

120
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,913
are already there.

121
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:28,740
Again, you can find them at
livemomentous.com/huberman.

122
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,520
Every so often, I come across
a study or set of studies

123
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,870
that I get so excited about

124
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,420
that I start telling
everybody in my immediate life

125
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,360
and I insist on also sharing it with you,

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
the listeners of this podcast,

127
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,540
because I find the information

128
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,360
to be so incredibly
interesting and actionable.

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,130
The two studies that I'm going to discuss

130
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,620
both relate to sleep and sleep states

131
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,660
and how to access better sleep.

132
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,600
The first one was published
in the journal Cell Reports,

133
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,340
Cell Press journal, excellent journal.

134
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,427
And the title of this paper is

135
00:04:57,427 --> 00:05:00,307
"Rapid and Reversible
Control of Human Metabolism

136
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,920
"by Individual Sleep States".

137
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,710
We will provide a link to this
study in the show captions.

138
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,850
The first author is Nora Nowak, N-O-W-A-K.

139
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,880
And basically what they
did is they measured

140
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,130
the different forms of
metabolism that occur

141
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,720
while humans sleep.

142
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,553
As far as I know,

143
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:19,320
this is one of the first
studies of this kind.

144
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,120
There are many studies of metabolism.

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,650
There are many studies of sleep.

146
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,710
This study focused on how
different states of sleep

147
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,450
such as rapid eye movement sleep,

148
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,830
which is associated with dreaming

149
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,870
and high emotional content dreams

150
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,250
versus slow wave sleep,

151
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,380
which tends to be more
focused on physical repair

152
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,270
of the body, more mundane dreams,

153
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,910
how those different states
of mind during sleep

154
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,610
relate to different aspects of metabolism

155
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,740
and what they found was
absolutely fascinating.

156
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,030
First of all,

157
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,810
they found that sleep states
regulate more than 50%,

158
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,290
half of all the metabolite
features detected

159
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,060
in human breath.

160
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,930
What does that mean?

161
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,460
Well, it turns out that you can figure out

162
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,800
what humans are
metabolizing in particular,

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,540
more lipids or more carbohydrate,

164
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,700
whether or not they're relying
more on glucose metabolism

165
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,470
based on the contents of their breath.

166
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,327
This is true during
waking and during sleep.

167
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:07,530
And this is what allowed them

168
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,820
to do these incredible measurements

169
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,130
of what's being metabolized during sleep.

170
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,430
They measured close to
2000 metabolites in breath,

171
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,340
every 10 seconds across
the entire night's sleep.

172
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,320
And what they found was that

173
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,590
there are major pathways
related to lipid metabolism,

174
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,670
fat metabolism,

175
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,560
or to carbohydrate metabolism

176
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,240
or other forms of metabolism

177
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,840
that are up or down regulated
as human beings transition

178
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,060
between slow wave sleep,

179
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,620
rapid eye movement sleep

180
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,453
and waking.

181
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:36,286
And you might say waking?

182
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:38,100
Well, yes, they also looked
as people fell asleep

183
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,180
and as they emerged from sleep.

184
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,280
And believe it or not every
so often during sleep,

185
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,900
you wake up, you didn't know this,

186
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,890
but you wake up in the
middle of the night,

187
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,050
you look around and you go back to sleep.

188
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,640
You're not aware of it
because you're still

189
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,080
in a rather sleep like state,
although you are awake.

190
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,430
What they found was that sleep

191
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,870
and the various states of sleep

192
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,870
regulated individual metabolic pathways.

193
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,340
They found for instance,

194
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,040
that the switch from sleep to wakefulness

195
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,230
reduces fatty acid oxidation.

196
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,520
So that means while you're asleep,

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
you're oxidating more fatty acids.

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,040
And as you wake up, that
becomes less the case.

199
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,990
And there's a switch in slow wave sleep

200
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,140
that increases fatty acid oxidation.

201
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,080
And there's this transition
from rapid eye movement sleep

202
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,550
to other aspects of sleep

203
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,490
that brings about things
like the so-called TCA cycle.

204
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,990
Some of you familiar with metabolism

205
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,610
will be familiar with the TCA cycle,

206
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,800
the so-called tricarboxylic acid cycle,

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,170
intermediates, that's fancy nerd speak

208
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,070
for specific aspects of
metabolism being regulated

209
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,430
during this rapid eye
movement sleep transition.

210
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,810
What does all this mean?

211
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,070
And how is this actionable?

212
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,250
Well, on many episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast

213
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,620
such as the master sleep episode

214
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,940
and the episode that we're going

215
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,950
into in further depth today,

216
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,710
we're going to talk about sleep
and how to optimize sleep.

217
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,570
It's been thought of,

218
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,150
but not really tamped down

219
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,360
that quality and depth of
sleep and duration of sleep

220
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,820
is important for metabolism
during the daytime.

221
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,990
And indeed that's the case.

222
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,780
If people are sleep deprived
or they're not sleeping enough,

223
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,640
things like glucose metabolism, et cetera,

224
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,680
get really disrupted during the daytime.

225
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,750
But what this current study shows

226
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,990
is that the metabolism that
you experience during sleep,

227
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,220
or to be more specific,

228
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,860
the range of different types of metabolism

229
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,420
that you experience during sleep

230
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,370
may serve to tune up

231
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,220
or to ensure that the
specific aspects of metabolism

232
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,550
that you require during
wakefulness are working properly.

233
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,840
In addition to that,

234
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,870
this study clearly shows
that getting enough sleep

235
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,159
allows you to transition

236
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,769
through all the various
forms of metabolism

237
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,450
and use all those different forms

238
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,580
of metabolites during sleep

239
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,620
in a way that's immensely beneficial

240
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,810
for the systems of your brain and body.

241
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,880
So the take home message here is that,

242
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,980
as the author state,

243
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,670
sleep and experiencing the
different states of sleep,

244
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,890
slow wave sleep early in
the night, predominantly,

245
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,130
plus rapid eye movement sleep
toward the end of the night

246
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,580
is extremely important for
optimizing metabolic circuits

247
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,560
for human performance and health.

248
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
In other words, by not getting
sufficient duration sleep,

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
you're not allowing your body

250
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,340
and brain to transition through
all the different aspects

251
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,140
of fuel utilization

252
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,320
and you're not teaching
your brain and body

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,110
how to use similar types of
fuels during wakefulness.

254
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,820
So again, all of this points to the fact

255
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,160
that we need to be
getting sufficient quality

256
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,300
and duration of sleep.

257
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,180
So if you're sleep deprived,
even by an hour or so,

258
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,460
you're going to get far less
rapid eye movement sleep

259
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,200
because rapid eye movement
sleep is what occurs

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,540
toward the end of a sleep night.

261
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,590
During the early part of the night,

262
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,780
far more slow wave sleep.

263
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,480
In getting less rapid eye movement sleep,

264
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,280
we know it makes you
more emotionally labile,

265
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,130
but now we know it's also
going to alter certain forms

266
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,260
of glucose metabolism

267
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,760
during the night

268
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,770
and during wakefulness.

269
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,800
So that all underscores
the need to get sleep.

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,750
But then the question is
how to get enough sleep

271
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,680
and how to make sure you get

272
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,450
into all these different sleep states.

273
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,860
And this is particularly important

274
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,140
for you so-called night owls.

275
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,940
There's a lot of controversy out there

276
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,760
as to whether or not different
so-called chronotypes exist,

277
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,030
that is people who just
naturally or genetically

278
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,710
want to be an early bird,

279
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,090
wake up early and go to bed early.

280
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,580
So these people that wake up at 4:00 AM

281
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,770
and would be most comfortable going to bed

282
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,530
by seven or 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM.

283
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,420
Then they are so called night owls,

284
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,870
people that would feel
best or tend to feel best

285
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,740
when they go to sleep at 1:00
AM, 2:00 AM, even 3:00 AM,

286
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,050
and like to wake up
later 8:00, 9:00, 10:00,

287
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,960
or even 11:00 AM or noon.

288
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,793
And then of course,

289
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,240
most people go to sleep somewhere

290
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
between 10:00 PM and midnight

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,220
and wake up somewhere
between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM,

292
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,060
or I suppose more typically
6:00 AM and 8:00 AM.

293
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,160
Now whether or not real chronotypes exist

294
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,130
or whether or not people
simply select schedules

295
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,380
for sleep and wakefulness that they like

296
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,730
because of their social schedules

297
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,050
or the activities they enjoy.

298
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,180
For instance, some people
like to really go out,

299
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,250
they like to go out dancing or hear music,

300
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,070
or spend time in venues that
are only open late at night,

301
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,500
and don't even open until noon or after.

302
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,470
Other people like myself
rarely go out at night

303
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,700
but I like to get up early.

304
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,600
I like to exercise.

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,700
I like to see the sunrise, et cetera.

306
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,560
So I don't know if I'm a morning person

307
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,393
or an evening person.

308
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:15,780
I just know the things I enjoy

309
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,520
tend to happen in the
early part of the day.

310
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,800
And the things that I
don't enjoy quite as much

311
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,690
tend to happen late at night.

312
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,800
Regardless of whether or not

313
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,870
there are real genetic propensities

314
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,390
to be a night owl or an early bird

315
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,900
or a sort of typical person
right there in the middle,

316
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,010
it's very important that people

317
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,870
have some control over
their sleep schedule

318
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,130
and even more important,

319
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,740
that people are able to
get sufficient amount

320
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,170
of REM sleep and slow wave sleep,

321
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,070
for many reasons,

322
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,720
but including the reasons I discussed

323
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,153
in the previous study
related to metabolism.

324
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm very excited, therefore,

325
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,620
about a study that came
out in sleep medicine.

326
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,840
This was a few years ago, but
somehow I missed this one.

327
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,370
It was published in 2019.

328
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,937
And the title of this article is

329
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:57,007
"Resetting the Late Timing of 'Night Owls'

330
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,927
"Has a Positive Impact on Mental Health,

331
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,020
"Physical Health and Performance".

332
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,880
This is a study done in humans,

333
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,710
focusing specifically on people

334
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,530
that like to stay up late and sleep in,

335
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,920
but who desire to be able
to get up and feel alert

336
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,570
in order to go to work or study

337
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,490
and they want to go to
sleep a bit earlier.

338
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,990
And so there are a lot of questions

339
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,090
embedded in this study in particular,

340
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,130
whether or not people can
actually shift their schedule

341
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,870
by a few hours or more.

342
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,060
Some people out there contend
that if you're a night owl,

343
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,680
that's just going to be impossible

344
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,660
or very, very challenging to do.

345
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,280
Turns out it's not impossible

346
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,720
and it's not even that challenging to do

347
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,130
provided you do the right things.

348
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,630
Just a brief overview of the study

349
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,060
and then I'll give you the key takeaways.

350
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,950
It was a randomized control trial.

351
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,660
It involved a number of different people,

352
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,010
both male and female.

353
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,220
And what they did was they
used non-pharmacological,

354
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,190
practical interventions
in a real world setting,

355
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,510
here I'm paraphrasing.

356
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,880
They used targeted light exposure.

357
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,640
They used consistent sleep, wake times.

358
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,650
They used fixed meal times,

359
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,780
caffeine intake and exercise.

360
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,610
And this is one of the reasons
I love this study so much

361
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,540
because I've done episodes

362
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,920
where I've talked about temperature,

363
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
exercise, feeding, and most importantly,

364
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,600
light exposure as a way to control

365
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,010
and shift your sleep wake cycles,

366
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,610
your so-called circadian
timing and entrainment.

367
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,720
What did they find?

368
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,357
Well, they found "Significant improvements

369
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:19,950
"in terms of mood so far
less depression and stress",

370
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,947
subjectively measured,

371
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,070
"as well as improved
cognitive performance",

372
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,180
that was objectively measured.

373
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,620
So improved reaction times,

374
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,750
improved physical grip strength,

375
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,570
which is actually a measure
not just of strength per se,

376
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,670
but also of nervous system function

377
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,490
and a number of things
that people could do

378
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,560
in order to optimize their morning hours,

379
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,080
even though they were
night owls previously.

380
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,040
What did they have people do?

381
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,350
Well, I'm going to just
going to list this off

382
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,480
sort of rapid fire succession.

383
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,890
Then we'll provide a link to the study

384
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,910
if you want to learn more.

385
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,070
First of all, they told participants

386
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,290
to try and wake up two to three hours

387
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,910
before their typical wake up time,

388
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,750
two to three hours.

389
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,340
That seems brutal to me

390
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,660
and probably seems brutal to you

391
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,060
if you're somebody who
typically wakes up at 10:00 AM

392
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,140
to try and get up at eight
or even 7:00 AM consistently,

393
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,630
but they were also asked to maximize

394
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,610
outdoor light exposure during the mornings

395
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,950
for reasons that if you've
listened to this podcast before,

396
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,840
if you've heard me talk about before,

397
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,400
you know, that I'm
constantly talking about,

398
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,960
I'll probably go into the grave shouting,

399
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,630
please get as much light exposure

400
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,610
from sunlight early in the day as possible

401
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,750
because it sets in motion

402
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,490
a huge number of things
that are beneficial

403
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,170
for your mental health
and physical health,

404
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,880
including dopamine production,

405
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,220
timing melatonin production correctly,

406
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,170
reducing cortisol peaks late in the day,

407
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,820
et cetera, et cetera.

408
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,550
So they asked them to get a
lot of outdoor light exposure.

409
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,170
They didn't give them a specific amount.

410
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,003
What they said,

411
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,380
maximize outdoor light
exposure during the mornings,

412
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,550
the time before noon.

413
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,410
And again, they had them
waking up two to three hours

414
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,300
before their habitual wake up time.

415
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,440
They were also told,

416
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,460
and this is very important

417
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,230
if you're going to shift
your schedule earlier,

418
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,260
to try and keep sleep wake times fixed

419
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,720
between their work days
and their weekends.

420
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,400
So not sleeping in on the weekends

421
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,140
or not having any sleep in days,

422
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,900
regardless of how well they
slept the night before.

423
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,800
How fixed?

424
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,450
Within 15 to 30 minutes of
their pre-designated time.

425
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,060
So if they were waking up
at seven o'clock one day,

426
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,030
they set their alarm and they
made sure they got out of bed

427
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,420
at seven o'clock every day
plus or minus 30 minutes,

428
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,850
but never later than 7:30,

429
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,593
never earlier than 6:30.

430
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,220
Participants were also
asked to try and go to sleep

431
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,220
two to three hours before
their habitual bedtime.

432
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,110
So again, these are people
that want to stay up late,

433
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,150
like 11:00 PM, perhaps,

434
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,060
but even as late as 1:00 AM or 2:00 AM.

435
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,220
And now they are asked to go to sleep

436
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,800
two to three hours before
their habitual bedtime

437
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,440
and to wake up two to three hours earlier,

438
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,590
as I mentioned earlier.

439
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,560
They were also told,

440
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,660
and I love this because it
fits with many of the things

441
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,760
we've talked about on this podcast before,

442
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,850
to try and limit light
exposure during the evenings,

443
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,810
dim the lights or limit
altogether artificial lights.

444
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,890
Lot of reasons for that,

445
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,600
I covered that in the
Master Sleep episode,

446
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,750
I covered that in the Optimized
Health Using Light episode.

447
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,880
You can find those at HubermanLab.com.

448
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,530
They're asking them to do that here.

449
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,960
And they asked participants
to keep a regular schedule

450
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,220
for their daily meals,

451
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,220
not eating on the hour consistently,

452
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,160
you know, at 9:00 AM,
noon, 3:00 PM, exactly.

453
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,250
But within again, about 15 to 30 minutes,

454
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,350
they're always eating at the same times.

455
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,610
That was also important.

456
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,710
And again, that's because
we have these so-called

457
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,510
food in trained circadian clocks.

458
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,510
When you eat, tells your
body when to be alert

459
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,270
and when you're not
eating, when to be asleep.

460
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,150
And they were told to
not drink any caffeine

461
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,250
after 3:00 PM in the afternoon.

462
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,590
Another theme that we've
talked about on this podcast.

463
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,880
They were also told not to
take naps after 4:00 PM.

464
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,180
Naps are an interesting feature
of the sleep wake cycle.

465
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,010
To be very brief about this

466
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,330
and to pull from the episode

467
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,130
that I did with world sleep expert

468
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,010
from the University of
California Berkeley, Matt Walker,

469
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,170
naps are great for many people,

470
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,020
but don't nap if it interferes
with your nighttime sleep.

471
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,590
And in this study, they told
them don't nap after 4:00 PM.

472
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,980
And if you are a napper, don't
nap for more than 90 minutes.

473
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,940
10 minute naps are fine.

474
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,170
20 minute naps are fine.

475
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,849
Zero minute naps are fine,

476
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,739
but don't nap for more than 90 minutes.

477
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,180
And don't nap after 4:00 PM.

478
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,869
And to exercise during the morning.

479
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,459
Now this one can be a bit controversial

480
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,290
because I know a lot of the PTs out there

481
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,410
and a lot of the online, you know,

482
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,940
gym rats and people who,

483
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,710
and runners too, for that matter,

484
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,310
will say, well according to
body temperature and research,

485
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,140
it's best to exercise in the afternoon.

486
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,880
Look, it's better to exercise sometime

487
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,200
as opposed to no time,

488
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,440
but if you're focused on how
to shift your schedule earlier,

489
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,270
meaning get up earlier
and go to sleep earlier,

490
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,810
this study had people exercise
in the early part of the day,

491
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,720
certainly before 2:00 PM
and ideally before noon.

492
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,240
So again, this is a really important study

493
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,420
because it combines a lot
of different variables

494
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,640
to arrive at this very impressive shift

495
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,920
where people can get up
two to three hours earlier

496
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
and then pretty
consistently and reflexively

497
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,490
start going to bed two
to three hours earlier,

498
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,810
feeling more alert during the day,

499
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,490
again, improvements in
cognitive performance,

500
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,090
mood and physical performance,
grip, strength, et cetera.

501
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,550
Very few studies are able to

502
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,100
or are willing to tackle so many variables

503
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,960
and combine them in one study.

504
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,570
This paper, I think, does a
marvelous job of doing this

505
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,000
and is incorporating
things that individually,

506
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,710
each have some support for them

507
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,050
in animal studies and
previous human studies.

508
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,883
But as far as I know,

509
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,270
this is one of the few studies

510
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,120
that really combines all
these different features

511
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,920
in one place,

512
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,260
eating times, keeping those consistent,

513
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,220
getting maximal sunlight
exposure earlier in the day,

514
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,660
getting up at a consistent time,

515
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,200
going to sleep at a
consistent time and on and on.

516
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,910
It's a really marvelous
study for that reason.

517
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,310
And I think for any of
you that are night owls

518
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,760
and any of you that want to
reinforce your early waking

519
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,500
and early to bed times,

520
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,360
and I think for most all of you

521
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,550
who fall into that general middle category

522
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,930
of tend to go to sleep somewhere

523
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,250
between 10:00 PM and midnight,

524
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,120
'cause that's most people

525
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,630
and tend to wake up sometime
between 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM,

526
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,580
well, maybe you want to
become more of an early riser

527
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,200
or maybe you're going to travel

528
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,170
or the seasons are changing
and you want to shift your time

529
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,940
or you have a new job, et cetera,

530
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,800
or something that's actually very common

531
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,030
in terms of relationship struggle.

532
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,580
You want to match your wake sleep times,

533
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,070
or maybe you want to offset
your wake sleep times

534
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,140
from a significant other,

535
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,300
these sorts of approaches
that I described here

536
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,940
and that are supported
by the data in this paper

537
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,730
are absolutely powerful
and science supported.

538
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,230
And I'm certain that if
you were to apply them,

539
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,270
that you would see
essentially the same effects

540
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,230
that were observed here.

541
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,070
Before we begin,

542
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,780
I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

543
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,300
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

544
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,400
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

545
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,950
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

546
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,530
and science related tools
to the general public.

547
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,580
In keeping with that theme,

548
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,100
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

549
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,580
Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens now called AG1.

550
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,330
AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink

551
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,830
that also includes adaptogens

552
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,600
and digestive enzymes for health.

553
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,610
Now the probiotics are
particularly important to me

554
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,410
because there is now a wealth of data

555
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,940
showing that our gut microbiome,

556
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,740
that is trillions of little microbacteria

557
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,970
that are good for us,

558
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,670
impact our immune system, our hormones,

559
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,560
and the so-called gut brain access,

560
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,600
the connections between
our gut and our brain

561
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,740
that go in both directions,

562
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,780
gut to brain and brain to gut,

563
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,790
that control things like our mood,

564
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,320
our ability to think clearly

565
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,930
and focus and overall brain health.

566
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,890
And with AG1, I'm able to
optimize that gut brain access

567
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,350
through the probiotics and
the vitamins, minerals,

568
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,300
adaptogens and digestive enzymes,

569
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,890
support a number of other things

570
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,480
that relate to immediate
and long-term health.

571
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,040
In fact, anytime people ask me,

572
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,960
what's the one supplement
they should take,

573
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,270
I say AG1 Athletic Greens,

574
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,700
because it's going to
cover all of your bases

575
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,590
to the greatest degree.

576
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,970
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

577
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,610
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

578
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,750
to claim a special offer.

579
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,520
They'll give you five free travel packs

580
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,550
that make it easy to mix up
AG1 while you're on the road.

581
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,670
And they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

582
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,590
Vitamin D3 and K2 are important

583
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,230
for cardiovascular function
and calcium regulation,

584
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,630
and a number of other
important aspects of health.

585
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,960
Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

586
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,280
to claim that special offer

587
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,540
of the five free travel packs

588
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,450
and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.

589
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,970
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.

590
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,250
Thesis makes custom nootropics.

591
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,430
And frankly, I'm not a big
fan of the word nootropics.

592
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,010
I've said that on various
podcasts and on social media posts

593
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,750
and the reason I'm not a
fan of the word nootropics

594
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,580
is it means smart drugs,

595
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,170
but as a neuroscientist,

596
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,750
I know that we don't have
circuits in the brain

597
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,850
or chemicals in the brain for being smart.

598
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,010
We have circuits in the brain for focus

599
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,020
and for task switching and for creativity.

600
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,390
And oftentimes, those circuits
differ from one another,

601
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,100
although they collaborate to create things

602
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,810
that we think of as intelligence

603
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,060
or focus or creativity, et cetera.

604
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,190
Thesis understands this
and for that reason

605
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,930
has developed custom nootropics

606
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,850
that are matched to your particular goals

607
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,250
and to your particular biology.

608
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,120
They give you the opportunity

609
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,310
to try several different blends
over the course of a month

610
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,020
and discover which ones work best for you

611
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,580
and which ones don't.

612
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,080
In addition to that personalization,

613
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,010
they take it a step further

614
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,350
by offering free
consultations with a coach

615
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,850
to help you optimize your experience

616
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,250
and dial in your perfect formulas.

617
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,560
I've be using Thesis for
about eight months now

618
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,900
and I can confidently
say that their nootropics

619
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,700
are the best that I've ever used.

620
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,980
My go-to formula is the Clarity formula

621
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,240
or the Motivation formula

622
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,010
when I'm going to work or work out,

623
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,140
meaning I'm going to do
focus cognitive work,

624
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,190
or I'm going to exercise.

625
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,890
I also like their Energy
formula prior to exercise.

626
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,870
To get your own personalized
nootropic starter kit,

627
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,050
go online to takethesis.com/huberman.

628
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,600
You can take a three minute
quiz that will help match you

629
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,820
to the best custom
nootropics to start with.

630
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,950
And Thesis will send you
four different formulas

631
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,330
to try in that first month.

632
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,000
Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman

633
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,530
and use the code Huberman at checkout

634
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,720
to get 10% off your first order.

635
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,330
Today's episode is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

636
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,970
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

637
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,670
that analyzes data from
your blood and your DNA

638
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,200
to help you better understand your body

639
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
and help you reach your health goals.

640
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,940
I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done

641
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,920
for the simple reason
that many of the things

642
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,110
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

643
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,110
can only be measured from
a quality blood test.

644
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,600
And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA test,

645
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,970
you can also get insight
into, for instance,

646
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,350
what is your biological age

647
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,450
and how does that compare
to your chronological age?

648
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,950
And of course, your biological age

649
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,513
is really the one that matters.

650
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,600
With InsideTracker, there's
an additional advantage

651
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
over other blood tests and DNA tests.

652
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,220
And that is with many blood
tests and DNA tests out there,

653
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,550
you get information back about
hormones, lipids, et cetera,

654
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,320
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

655
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,480
With InsideTracker,
they have a very simple,

656
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,630
easy to use personalized platform

657
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,820
that tells you what sorts of changes

658
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,320
to make in your nutrition,

659
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,150
possible changes to supplementation,

660
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,710
behavioral changes, et cetera,

661
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,780
that will allow you to bring the numbers

662
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,060
related to your hormones
and your lipids, et cetera,

663
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,490
into the ranges that are
optimal for your mental health,

664
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,320
physical health and performance goals.

665
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,253
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

666
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:56,850
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

667
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,880
to get 20% off any of
InsideTracker's plans.

668
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,720
That's insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 20% off.

669
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,310
Let's talk about how to optimize

670
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,400
and indeed how to control
your brain chemistry

671
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,860
for a sake of health and performance.

672
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,660
Now in order to do that,

673
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,130
we all need to be on the same page

674
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,050
about some basic facts.

675
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,190
Some of those basic facts

676
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,467
involve learning some basic biology.

677
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,960
And I promise that even if
you don't have a biology

678
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,340
or chemistry background,

679
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,500
everything I'm about to
say should be accessible

680
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,673
and clear to you.

681
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,740
The important thing to know

682
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,830
is that your brain and your spinal cord

683
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,160
and the rest of your
so-called nervous system

684
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,230
control all the organs of your body

685
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,170
and that all the organs
of your body feed back,

686
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,140
meaning they communicate through
chemicals and other means,

687
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,910
to your nervous system.

688
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,150
Now your nervous system plays
a particularly important role

689
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,130
in generating everything from sleep

690
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,020
to wakefulness, creativity,

691
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,690
stress, calm, et cetera,

692
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,430
by way of a particular type
of cell-cell interaction.

693
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,880
And that's called synaptic communication.

694
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,590
What is synaptic communication?

695
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,810
Well, in order to understand that

696
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,670
let's dial back a little bit further

697
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,830
and try and understand for a moment

698
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,260
what makes up your nervous system.

699
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,220
In its simplest form,

700
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,650
your nervous system is made of nerve cells

701
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,600
that we call neurons.

702
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,840
Neurons communicate with one
another through chemicals.

703
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,290
They release certain chemicals
that make other neurons

704
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,530
more or less likely to
be electrically active.

705
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,270
What do we mean by electrically active?

706
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,830
We mean,

707
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,850
as it sounds,

708
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,330
electricity passing down through cells

709
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,320
and then literally causing
electricity in other cells.

710
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,850
The simplest way to think about this

711
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,340
is maybe when you were a
kid or maybe even still now,

712
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,830
you would wear socks and
you'd shuffle along the floor

713
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,910
to generate some static electricity,

714
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,680
and then you'd touch
someone [playful whirring]

715
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,840
and you'd shock them with your finger.

716
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,680
I'm a younger brother

717
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,720
so I'd occasionally do that to my sister.

718
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
I had friends, we would
do that to one another.

719
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,620
I know it's kind of silly and childish,

720
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,240
yet, it illustrates the principle

721
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,870
that we can generate
electricity and pass electricity

722
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,540
to other beings or in the case of neurons,

723
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,130
from one neuron to the next.

724
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,570
The way neurons do that,

725
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,580
is that in between the neurons,

726
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,450
they're little spaces,

727
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,030
those little spaces are called synapses

728
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,060
and neurons literally vomit,

729
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,380
well, they don't literally vomit,

730
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,630
but they release little packets

731
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,660
of so-called transmitter chemical

732
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,670
into that space we call a synapse.

733
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,710
It travels across the synapse.

734
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,290
It attaches to the cell on the other side,

735
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,123
the other neuron.

736
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,220
And then depending on
what that chemical is,

737
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,860
it either makes that next
neuron more electrically active

738
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,150
or less electrically active,

739
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,770
so called excitation,

740
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,690
it either excites the next neuron

741
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,880
to be electrically active also,

742
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
or it inhibits, it
prevents the next neuron

743
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,430
from being electrically active.

744
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,390
So again, very simply,

745
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,490
we have nerve cells that
communicate with one another

746
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,620
through electricity and chemicals

747
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,570
that inspire that electricity

748
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,590
and the little gaps between
neurons are called synapses.

749
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,790
If you can understand that,

750
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,770
I'm certain you can make it
through the rest of the episode

751
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,860
and that you'll get all the
depth and important detail

752
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,510
that you need to know.

753
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,580
But I want to go just a little bit further

754
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,210
and explain that neurons
don't just talk one-to-one.

755
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,940
There are trillions of
neurons in your nervous system

756
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,310
that allow you to be happy, to be in love,

757
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,140
to be sad, to be in grief,

758
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,930
to remember things and so on.

759
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,780
And what you do at any moment,

760
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,180
what you feel and what you think

761
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,890
relates to which so-called
neural circuits are active.

762
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,780
So a lot of times we
think about brain areas

763
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,280
and we've all seen these
pictures of the brain

764
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,150
where, you know, someone
was in a fMRI scanner,

765
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,430
or they were in a brain
scanner of some sort,

766
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,380
and they saw a picture of something

767
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,620
and a certain area of the
brain lights up as it's called.

768
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,480
That lighting up of the
brain really reflects

769
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,580
the activity of hundreds,
if not thousands,

770
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,953
maybe even millions of
neurons in that region.

771
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,430
Those images of brain areas lighting up

772
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,740
and indeed talking about
brain areas lighting up,

773
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,540
can be a little bit or a lot misleading

774
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,850
because in fact, no single brain area

775
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,580
controls any one single perception

776
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,560
or behavior or feeling state.

777
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,020
Rather, we have so-called neuro circuits,

778
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,760
chains of neurons,

779
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,760
chains of specific neurons that is,

780
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,190
that create different states of mind

781
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,380
that lead to specific behaviors

782
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,200
that lead to specific emotional states.

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,970
And those neural circuits are made up

784
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,130
of lots of different
brain areas that light up

785
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,360
in particular sequences.

786
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,760
And when I say light up, excuse me,

787
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,050
what I mean is that particular
brain areas either excite

788
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,790
or prevent the excitation,

789
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,950
that is they inhibit other brain areas

790
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,570
in a particular sequence.

791
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,260
Much like keys on a piano
played in a particular sequence,

792
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,150
makes up a particular song,

793
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,080
particular brain areas
activated or made silent

794
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,430
in a particular sequence

795
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,980
leads to a particular behavior

796
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,660
like getting up out of a chair

797
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,520
or a particular feeling state

798
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,220
like being particularly happy
one day when you wake up

799
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,960
or particularly depressed,

800
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,080
whether or not that depression
is caused by a life event

801
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,600
or whether not it arises spontaneously.

802
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,550
So we have neurons, we have synapses

803
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,160
and we have neural circuits.

804
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,130
And vitally important is the fact that

805
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,950
which neural circuits are active

806
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,190
and which neural circuits
are likely to be less active

807
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,900
at any given moment,

808
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,740
depends on two major
categories of chemicals.

809
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,720
It depends on hormones

810
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,440
and it depends on
so-called neuromodulators.

811
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,870
Now we're mainly going to
focus on neuromodulators today

812
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,310
because those are the things

813
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,200
that if you can learn to control them,

814
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,510
and indeed there are
tools to control them,

815
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,960
then you can control which neural circuits

816
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,330
are more likely or less
likely to be active

817
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,100
in you at any given moment.

818
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,877
And in doing so,

819
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,481
you can control whether or not

820
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:57,192
you are going to be alert
and focused or deeply asleep.

821
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:58,603
You can control whether or not

822
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:00,404
you are going to be in a creative state

823
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:02,580
or whether or not you're
going to be in a state of mind

824
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,430
more fit, more capable that is

825
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,950
of doing focused work or math

826
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,750
or more so-called linear types of work

827
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,950
where there's a correct answer.

828
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,140
There's a specific thing to follow

829
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,810
and you're simply going to
plug and chug as it were

830
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,180
through a particular set of steps

831
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,410
in order to accomplish something.

832
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,640
Or for instance,

833
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,740
whether or not you're going
to be in a more relaxed

834
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,740
and creative state where
you're thinking about new ideas

835
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,820
or new ideas just seem to be
spontaneously coming to mind.

836
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,730
All of that can be controlled

837
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,860
to a considerable extent

838
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,130
by leveraging these
so-called neuromodulators.

839
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,870
What are neuromodulators?

840
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,100
Neuromodulators are particular chemicals

841
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,720
that make it likely

842
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,780
that certain neuro circuits
will be active and not others.

843
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,520
And the four neuromodulators

844
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,840
that we're going to talk about today

845
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,590
that are of the utmost
importance for your goals

846
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,960
are dopamine,

847
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,390
epinephrine also called adrenaline,

848
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,360
serotonin and acetylcholine.

849
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,280
That's dopamine, epinephrine,

850
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,233
serotonin and acetylcholine.

851
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,270
Today, I'm going to teach you

852
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,160
how each of those different categories

853
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,410
of neuromodulators work

854
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,300
and the things that you can do

855
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,240
to control those neuromodulators,

856
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,390
that is increase them or decrease them

857
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,630
through behavioral tools
and supplementation,

858
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,850
in ways that allow you to access

859
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,040
the brain and body states that you want

860
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,750
at the times that you want.

861
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,710
Just very quickly.

862
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,100
I want to talk about how
neuromodulators are able to work,

863
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,810
regardless of whether or not it's dopamine

864
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,483
or serotonin or epinephrine, et cetera.

865
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,380
There are many features of
how neuromodulators work,

866
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,600
but for sake of today's discussion,

867
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,090
we only need to focus on
two of those features.

868
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,520
And those are fast-acting features

869
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,380
and longer slower features

870
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,020
or what we call baseline features.

871
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,740
What am I talking about when
I say faster or baseline?

872
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,800
Well, consider that at any given moment,

873
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,420
whether or not you're asleep or awake,

874
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,910
whether or not it's morning
or afternoon or night,

875
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,460
you have some amount of dopamine

876
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,500
being released in your brain and body,

877
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,090
some amount of serotonin,

878
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,680
some amount of epinephrine

879
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,590
and some amount of acetylcholine.

880
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,290
It is rarely, if ever the case,

881
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,833
that you have zero
dopamine or zero serotonin.

882
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,090
You know, so often we hear about someone

883
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,470
being dopamine depleted

884
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,720
or these days, you hear
a lot about that anyways.

885
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,680
Or you'll hear that people's
serotonin is bottomed out.

886
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,870
In reality, none of these neuromodulators

887
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,210
ever disappear completely,

888
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,090
but they tend to be
present at different levels

889
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,950
or different relative levels.

890
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,660
Another important thing to point out

891
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,090
is that they don't work alone.

892
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,710
In fact, as you'll soon learn,

893
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,040
dopamine and epinephrine are close cousins

894
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,100
that collaborate in
terms of creating states

895
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,410
of focus and motivation, for instance,

896
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,080
or in creating states of energy

897
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,913
and the pursuit of particular goals.

898
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,380
When I say they're close cousins,

899
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,830
what I mean is that they tend to impact

900
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,170
some of the same neural circuits.

901
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,310
And believe it or not,

902
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,790
dopamine and epinephrine
are chemically related, too.

903
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,690
I'll just tell you right now

904
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,200
that epinephrine is actually
derived from dopamine,

905
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,890
chemically epinephrine,
that is adrenaline,

906
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,740
is made from the molecule dopamine.

907
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,280
Now dopamine and serotonin
can also work together

908
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,290
to impact certain circuits in the brain.

909
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,850
But in large part,

910
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,100
they operate on separate circuits.

911
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,440
And acetylcholine,

912
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,790
which you'll soon learn is involved

913
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,210
in states of focus and
can actually open up,

914
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,520
it can literally create states in the mind

915
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,740
in which your brain is more plastic

916
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,350
and able to change and learn more quickly.

917
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,750
Well, acetylcholine
can do that on its own,

918
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,210
but rarely does it do it on its own.

919
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,400
More typically, it gets assistance

920
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,290
from some of the other neuromodulators.

921
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,060
Now that might seem like
it complicates the picture,

922
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,340
but it actually makes
the picture far simpler

923
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,410
because what we can say for sure

924
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,860
is that the fast actions of dopamine

925
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,600
or the fast actions of epinephrine,

926
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,460
serotonin or acetylcholine

927
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,969
are actions that occur on the
order of seconds or minutes

928
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,009
or up to about an hour or so.

929
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,250
Whereas the slower actions
of those neuromodulators

930
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,330
tend to occur on the order of
hours, days, or even weeks.

931
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,650
Now perhaps surprisingly,

932
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,510
I'd like to focus on the slow actions

933
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,400
of the neuromodulators first,

934
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,310
because those slow actions
of the neuromodulators

935
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,239
are happening in you and in
me and in everyone right now,

936
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,859
and they set the backdrop,

937
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,889
the context in which the various tools

938
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,709
to manipulate dopamine,
epinephrine, serotonin,

939
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,679
or acetylcholine will work.

940
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,029
What do I mean by the context

941
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,070
or the backdrop or the baseline?

942
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,550
Well, it's fair to say that most people

943
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,710
are awake during the
daytime and asleep at night.

944
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,330
I do realize that there are people

945
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,360
who are going to be doing shift work

946
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,220
or they're raising young children,

947
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,950
or that might have a sick person at home

948
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,240
that they're tending to, et cetera,

949
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,820
or even have insomnia,
they're tending to them.

950
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,120
So schedules of sleep and
wakefulness will vary,

951
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,130
but in general, everybody,

952
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,290
regardless of whether
or not you're nocturnal

953
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,530
or you're, so-called, diurnal,
your awake during the day,

954
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,500
pretty much everybody
follows a schedule in which

955
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,893
from zero to nine hours after waking,

956
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,080
that is from the time you wake up

957
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,290
until about nine hours later,

958
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,120
the neuromodulators,

959
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,400
dopamine and epinephrine,

960
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,280
tend to be at their highest
levels that they will be

961
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,090
at any point in the 24-hour period,

962
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,070
in any period of the day.

963
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,980
So we can call this
zero to nine hour period

964
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,620
phase one of the day, just for simplicity.

965
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,800
And I've referred to this
before in a previous episode,

966
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,233
but not in this exact context.

967
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,060
From nine to about 16 hours is
what we would call phase two.

968
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,330
And that's when dopamine
and epinephrine levels

969
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,650
tend to subside a bit

970
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,400
compared to the earlier
phase one part of the day

971
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,850
and serotonin levels start to increase.

972
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,940
And then phase three of the 24-hour cycle,

973
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,200
which is from about,

974
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,420
and again about the zero approximates,

975
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,430
from about 17 hours after waking

976
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,040
until about 24 hours after waking

977
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,440
is phase three of the day.

978
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,510
And during that time,

979
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,990
there is chaos in terms of which

980
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,330
neuromodulators are most
present in the brain.

981
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,570
And by chaos, what I mean
is that during sleep,

982
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,880
you have incredible peaks in acetylcholine

983
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,920
and drops in acetylcholine.

984
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,660
You have incredible peaks in dopamine

985
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,550
and drops in dopamine.

986
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,260
You have incredible peaks in serotonin

987
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,150
and drops in serotonin.

988
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,730
Most often, you are not going to see

989
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,390
much if any release of
epinephrine, adrenaline,

990
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,280
and that's because epinephrine,

991
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,870
also called adrenaline,

992
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,100
tends to wake us up and put
us into action mode behaviors

993
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,200
and that's simply not
happening during sleep.

994
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,510
But for the other three neuromodulators,

995
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,070
across the night,

996
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,630
it's sort of chaos.

997
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,610
You've got peaks and
drops and peaks and drops

998
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,720
in different combinations

999
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,400
than you would ever see in wakefulness.

1000
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,290
And this plays important
roles in dreaming,

1001
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,123
important roles

1002
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:16,830
in some of the reparative
functions of sleep.

1003
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,190
The point is that during that phase three,

1004
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,590
the levels of neuromodulators
are all over the place,

1005
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,810
but it's not random, right?

1006
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,940
I say it's chaos, but it's organized

1007
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,670
according to the specific
reparative goals of sleep,

1008
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,610
the specific metabolic
roles of sleep, et cetera.

1009
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,520
We're not going to focus too
much on phase three today

1010
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,670
because phase three of the 24-hour cycle,

1011
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,530
that 17 to 24-hour period,

1012
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,900
is one in which you ought
to be deeply asleep,

1013
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,880
whether or not you're
nocturnal or diurnal, right?

1014
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,940
17 hours after waking,
you ought to be asleep.

1015
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,430
And there are a lot of
episodes of this podcast.

1016
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,740
And indeed, today, I started talking about

1017
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,074
two particular studies related to sleep,

1018
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:57,810
and there are a lot of tools
to enhance sleep, et cetera.

1019
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,340
And of course there are
things that you can do

1020
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,030
in the late portion of
phase two of the day

1021
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,730
in order to enhance your transition time

1022
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,470
into and depth of sleep.

1023
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,110
But you can't really do
much during sleep, right?

1024
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,250
You're not taking supplements.

1025
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,260
You're not doing breathing practices.

1026
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,247
There are things to fall back asleep,

1027
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,960
but you're not really
doing much during sleep.

1028
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,580
So we're mainly going to focus

1029
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,610
on what we're calling
phase one and phase two.

1030
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,500
Phase one, being this dopamine

1031
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,720
epinephrine dominated phase of our day.

1032
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,750
And phase two being this more serotonergic

1033
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,030
or serotonin dominated portion of the day.

1034
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,870
And then you might say,

1035
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,030
well, what about acetylcholine?

1036
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,140
You forgot about acetylcholine?

1037
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,730
Well, we didn't forget
about acetylcholine.

1038
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,730
Acetylcholine is under control

1039
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,060
more in terms of what
we happen to be doing

1040
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,930
at any given moment,

1041
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,760
whether or not we're
focusing or not focusing,

1042
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,190
whether or not we're
learning or not learning.

1043
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,720
And here I'm referring to acetylcholine

1044
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,750
specifically in the context
of the brain and thinking,

1045
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,890
because as some of you

1046
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,900
are probably shouting out there, right,

1047
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,640
if you're an exercise physiologist

1048
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,270
or you know anything about how
the brain controls movement,

1049
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,900
acetylcholine is used at the
nerve to muscle synapse, right?

1050
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,410
So neurons don't just control
other neurons electrically.

1051
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,030
The way you are able to move in fact

1052
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,260
is because neurons are controlling

1053
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,470
the electric activity of muscles,

1054
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,270
literally the contraction
of muscle fibers,

1055
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,360
and that control is exerted

1056
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,710
through the release of acetylcholine.

1057
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,720
So acetylcholine is working
at muscles, as well,

1058
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,520
but we're not focused on that today.

1059
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,520
We're focused on what we can do

1060
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,810
during phase one of the day

1061
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,090
and what we can do during
phase two of the day

1062
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,240
to control the specific neuromodulators,

1063
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,060
dopamine, epinephrine,
serotonin, and acetylcholine,

1064
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,950
toward particular end goals.

1065
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,920
And as I've been harping
on for the last five

1066
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,720
or 10 minutes or so,

1067
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,190
it is important to understand

1068
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,440
that in the early phase
one part of the day,

1069
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,450
again, zero to nine hours,

1070
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,420
dopamine and epinephrine already

1071
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,780
dominate the neuromodulator landscape.

1072
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,760
That is they are already elevated

1073
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,710
and then they will taper off in phase two.

1074
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,390
Whereas in phase two of the day,

1075
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,460
serotonin tends to dominate

1076
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,610
more than dopamine and epinephrine.

1077
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,040
And so if you think about that,

1078
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,720
what it means is that if your goal

1079
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,670
is to increase serotonin

1080
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,490
in order to get some particular effect

1081
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,560
on your mental performance

1082
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,110
or physical performance or health,

1083
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,920
or if your goal is to increase
your dopamine or epinephrine,

1084
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,070
to get some particular
effect on your mental health,

1085
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,590
physical performance, et cetera,

1086
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,270
well, then you need to consider

1087
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,180
what the background level of dopamine

1088
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,000
or epinephrine or serotonin happens to be

1089
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,350
because in doing so,

1090
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,900
you will know which tool to select

1091
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,010
and how hard you need to
push on that tool, right?

1092
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,190
If your levels of dopamine are
already riding pretty high,

1093
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,080
because it's the early part of the day,

1094
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,990
well then it doesn't take a whole lot more

1095
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,870
to get dopamine to a
level in which it can,

1096
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,120
for instance, change
your level of motivation.

1097
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,370
Whereas if you are in
the late part of the day,

1098
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,500
let's say eight or 9:00 PM,

1099
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,660
and you have a lot of serotonin

1100
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,640
swimming around in your system

1101
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,340
and you really need to
be focused and alert,

1102
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,820
well, you can do that by
leveraging the dopamine

1103
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,810
and epinephrine system

1104
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,060
and indeed the acetylcholine system too,

1105
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,850
but you're going to
have to resort to tools

1106
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,250
that can do that far more potently

1107
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,550
and that can do that in
a much more sustained way

1108
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,100
if you're going to access
the state that you want.

1109
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,400
So again, it's really
important to understand

1110
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,850
what the backdrop of
these neuromodulators is,

1111
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,320
the so-called baseline

1112
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,480
and that they vary across the day

1113
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,790
if you are going to be
able to leverage tools

1114
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,620
to optimize your brain chemistry.

1115
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,930
Anyone that tells you do this protocol

1116
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,520
in order to increase your dopamine,

1117
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,870
do this protocol,

1118
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,600
or take this supplement to
increase your serotonin,

1119
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,970
they can be telling
you the absolute truth,

1120
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,190
but if you don't consider the backdrop

1121
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,960
over which that supplement

1122
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,270
or behavior is going to have its effect,

1123
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,850
well, then you can't really
predict the effect it will have.

1124
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,600
But if you can understand these
backdrop baseline elements

1125
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,280
to how neuromodulators work,

1126
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,930
well, then you're in a terrific position

1127
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,820
to leverage the best tools

1128
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,897
in the immediate and short-term

1129
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:12,990
and that is on the order of
seconds, minutes and hours.

1130
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,180
Before we dive into the more pointed,

1131
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,110
directed effects of specific
tools on neuromodulators,

1132
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,210
I'd like to just briefly mention hormones

1133
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,650
because they are also important

1134
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,490
for understanding the
background and the context

1135
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,684
and these baseline levels
of neuromodulators.

1136
00:42:29,684 --> 00:42:32,490
Now here, I'm going to paint
with a bit of a broad brush,

1137
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,080
but what I will say is accurate,

1138
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,120
even though it might not be exhaustive.

1139
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,970
What I mean by that is everything
I'm about to say is true,

1140
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,340
but it doesn't cover
every example in detail

1141
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,830
and nuanced possibility out there.

1142
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:48,030
Hormones have many different
effects on the brain and body

1143
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,590
and not unlike neuromodulators,

1144
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,660
some of those effects are very fast.

1145
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,100
Some of them are very slow.

1146
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,560
In fact, certain hormones,

1147
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,780
for instance, the steroid hormones,

1148
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,350
like estrogen and like testosterone

1149
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,920
and corticosteroids

1150
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,793
and here, of course,

1151
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:07,170
I'm referring to the steroid
hormones for what they are.

1152
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,940
They are indeed steroid hormones,

1153
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,100
but I'm not talking about steroids

1154
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,140
that people inject for sports performance

1155
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,310
or for physical augmentation.

1156
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,050
I'm talking about the steroid hormones

1157
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,070
that you make naturally

1158
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,440
because indeed you make these naturally.

1159
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,420
Well, the steroid hormones

1160
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,580
can actually control gene expression.

1161
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,380
They can change the identity of cells

1162
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,290
and the genes and proteins
that cells express.

1163
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,540
This is why during puberty, for instance,

1164
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,150
testosterone and estrogen
are released into the body,

1165
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,950
growth hormone is released into the body

1166
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,010
and bodies and voices and personalities

1167
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,080
and brains change tremendously

1168
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,570
because literally there
is a transformation

1169
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,820
of the breast tissue,

1170
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,320
of the testicular tissue,

1171
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,920
of the ovarian tissue, of
the bones, of the muscles,

1172
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,540
of the tissues and cells
that control hair growth.

1173
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,750
Gene expression changes
in all those cell types.

1174
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,270
And the child becomes an adolescent,

1175
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,160
becomes a young adult, right?

1176
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,780
That's what puberty really is.

1177
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,310
In fact, puberty is perhaps

1178
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,340
the most dramatic transformation
that we go through

1179
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,970
in our entire lifespan
in terms of our aging,

1180
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,210
'cause indeed it reflects a very rapid,

1181
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,010
I should mention, period of aging

1182
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,830
and transformation of
the identity of cells.

1183
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,480
So steroid hormones and other hormones

1184
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,130
can have very slow long-lasting
actions in that way.

1185
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,290
They can also have very fast actions.

1186
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,123
So for instance,

1187
00:44:29,123 --> 00:44:32,520
adrenaline, epinephrine,
released from the adrenal glands

1188
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,710
can immediately make
your heart beat faster,

1189
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,650
can immediately change the circumference

1190
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:41,040
of your blood vessels and
arteries and capillaries

1191
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,570
and change the way blood flows.

1192
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,000
It can change the way you
see the world, literally.

1193
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,650
It does change the way you see the world

1194
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,727
through your visual system.

1195
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,440
And that all happens on the order

1196
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,170
of hundreds of milliseconds or seconds,

1197
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,480
these are extremely fast actions.

1198
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,470
Corticosteroid also can have
fast actions and slow actions.

1199
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,000
But since this isn't a
discussion about hormones per se,

1200
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,260
and we've done entire episodes

1201
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,020
like the Optimize Testosterone
and Estrogen episode.

1202
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,730
You can find that at HubermanLab.com.

1203
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,060
Or the interview with the
incredibly knowledgeable

1204
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,720
and clear and

1205
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,600
really wonderful tutor of
actionable information,

1206
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,490
Dr. Kyle Gillette, who
is also on this podcast,

1207
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,320
you can learn a lot about hormones there.

1208
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,670
Today, we want to think about hormones

1209
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,737
as they relate to these neuromodulators,

1210
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:28,950
the dopamine, serotonin,
epinephrine and acetylcholine,

1211
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,423
and in general,

1212
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,470
testosterone tends to collaborate with

1213
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,230
and increase the action of dopamine.

1214
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,600
That's not always the
case, but in general,

1215
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,750
when testosterone goes
up, dopamine goes up

1216
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,490
and sometimes even vice versa.

1217
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,560
When dopamine goes up, testosterone go up.

1218
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,790
And this is true for both
males and for females.

1219
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,820
In general, when corticosteroids

1220
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,470
like cortisol and some related
steroid hormones increase,

1221
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,420
epinephrine levels go up.

1222
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,540
And in general, when
hormones like oxytocin

1223
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,570
or prolactin are increased,

1224
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,730
levels of serotonin go up.

1225
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,440
We can't draw a direct link

1226
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,080
between any one hormone
system and acetylcholine.

1227
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,340
Acetylcholine kind of sits off

1228
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,500
in a category of its own in that way.

1229
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,930
But again, in general,
testosterone and dopamine

1230
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,630
tend to collaborate in the same direction.

1231
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,660
Cortisol and epinephrine
tend to collaborate

1232
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,773
in the same direction.

1233
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,300
Oxytocin and prolactin,
which are hormones,

1234
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,750
and serotonin tend to collaborate
in the same direction.

1235
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,050
And then we have poor
old, lonely acetylcholine

1236
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,760
off on its own, but it's
not poor and lonely.

1237
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,800
It actually has incredibly
potent effects on its own.

1238
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,960
So it's really that it
just doesn't mean much help

1239
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,060
from the hormone systems

1240
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,770
or at least not the
steroid hormone systems

1241
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,200
in order to have its tremendous effects.

1242
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,490
Now a lot of what people think about

1243
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:53,370
and will do when trying
to improve mental health

1244
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,420
and physical health

1245
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,400
is they will try and increase

1246
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,850
or decrease certain categories of hormones

1247
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,880
of the sort that I mentioned,

1248
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,943
testosterone, estrogen,
oxytocin, and prolactin, so on.

1249
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,490
But oftentimes, the effects
of those manipulations

1250
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,100
in hormones that are
going to be most salient

1251
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,050
are not going to be due
to the direct effects

1252
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,100
of those hormones.

1253
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,480
Sometimes it could be.

1254
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,180
But oftentimes it's going
to be due to their effects

1255
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,920
on the brain and nervous system

1256
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,090
by way of how those hormones
impact neuromodulators.

1257
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,860
So for instance,

1258
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,420
there are various things
that people can do,

1259
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,290
both men and women,

1260
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,750
to increase their
testosterone and estrogen

1261
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,550
in the appropriate ratios.

1262
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:36,510
I talked about one such
approach in a previous episode,

1263
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:38,880
and that is to get sunlight

1264
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,740
onto a large portion
of one's skin each day.

1265
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,840
Believe it or not, this actually works.

1266
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,150
And it works because your skin

1267
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,590
is actually an endocrine organ,

1268
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,930
a hormone secreting organ.

1269
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,770
It's a beautiful study.

1270
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,360
I've covered it on this podcast before.

1271
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,100
We will provide a link
to this study again,

1272
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:01,080
but it had people spend
at least 20 minutes or so,

1273
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,610
closer to 30 minutes, each day,

1274
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,530
trying to maximize sunlight exposure

1275
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,180
to as much of their skin as they could

1276
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,450
in terms of still
maintaining decent exposure,

1277
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,970
meaning not over exposing
themselves in a cultural way,

1278
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,070
meaning wearing enough
clothes that they were decent,

1279
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,590
but still getting a lot of sun exposure,

1280
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,393
a couple of times per week or more.

1281
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,270
What they found was that
people's testosterone

1282
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,710
and estrogen levels went up.

1283
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,180
Feelings of well-being went up.

1284
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,690
Feelings of well, or I should
say increases in libido

1285
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,460
were observed, as well.

1286
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,340
They subjectively reported
more passion, et cetera,

1287
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,430
testosterone and estrogen
did indeed both go up.

1288
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,460
And again, I want to highlight
that increases in estrogen,

1289
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,510
not just testosterone,

1290
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,230
are related to increases in
libido in both men and women.

1291
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,070
This is why you never want

1292
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,750
to crush your estrogen down to zero,

1293
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,430
whether or not you're male or female,

1294
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,910
if you want to maintain
some sort of healthy libido

1295
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,000
and general feelings of
well-being, unrelated to libido.

1296
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,790
Well, many of those effects

1297
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,890
we know are not due to direct effects

1298
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,660
of testosterone and estrogen,

1299
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,340
but rather are due to the effects

1300
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,010
of testosterone and estrogen
on the neuromodulators,

1301
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,170
dopamine and serotonin,

1302
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,500
because much of libido
and feelings of well-being

1303
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,780
and feelings of relaxation,

1304
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,450
but also desire, motivation, et cetera,

1305
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,560
originate because of the
activation of neural circuits

1306
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,230
that dopamine controls and promotes

1307
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,590
and that serotonin promote and control.

1308
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,590
So this is very important to understand

1309
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,080
as we move toward more specific discussion

1310
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,410
of the chemicals that
we call neuromodulators,

1311
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,310
because hormones are controlling
those neuromodulators

1312
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,070
in a very slow modulatory way.

1313
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,020
So yes, I said it,

1314
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,570
hormones modulate neuromodulators.

1315
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,093
I sort of said it twice on purpose.

1316
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,230
And this is a dramatic and potent effect.

1317
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,880
So I'll just give you one more example.

1318
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,120
The hormone prolactin
tends to be antagonistic.

1319
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,310
It tends to reduce amounts of dopamine

1320
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:02,160
or at least when
prolactin levels are high,

1321
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,560
dopamine levels tend to be lower.

1322
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,170
You observe this after
the birth of a new child,

1323
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,930
you observe this post
coitally after mating,

1324
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,603
in all species, humans and animals.

1325
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,930
When prolactin is elevated,

1326
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,790
serotonin tends to be elevated.

1327
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,680
And when prolactin is elevated,

1328
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,760
levels of dopamine and
the effects of dopamine

1329
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,100
tend to subside.

1330
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,990
Now as I move toward explaining

1331
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,170
what each of the four categories
of neuromodulators do,

1332
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,700
this will start to make
more and more sense

1333
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,380
as to why this would be.

1334
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,290
I always say I wasn't
consulted in the design phase,

1335
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,540
meaning I didn't design these circuits.

1336
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,920
And if anyone tells you that they did,

1337
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,330
you should back away quickly

1338
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,220
because none of us design these circuits.

1339
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,600
This is the way that evolution

1340
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,840
and nature created these systems.

1341
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,150
And they tend to work in
a bit of a seesaw fashion,

1342
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:54,030
prolactin up, dopamine down, right?

1343
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,680
Dopamine up, prolactin down.

1344
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,230
In general, that is the way they work.

1345
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:01,320
So if we are to take a
look at how each of these

1346
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,100
neuromodulator systems
functions on its own,

1347
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,240
while understanding that

1348
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,370
they never truly function on their own,

1349
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,380
we can start to really make sense

1350
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,660
of the landscape of tools
that are available to us

1351
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,750
and which tools are going to
be most powerful to select

1352
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,360
if our goal is for instance, to be focused

1353
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,030
or if our goal is to be less stressed

1354
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,780
or if our goal is to be highly motivated

1355
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,700
and highly focused for sake of learning.

1356
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,710
All of that is indeed possible

1357
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,740
if you understand these
four neuromodulators

1358
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,350
and you understand that
while there are many tools

1359
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,270
ranging from pharmacologic to behavioral

1360
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,220
that can tap into these
neuromodulator systems,

1361
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,650
that can kind of press
on the gas of dopamine,

1362
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,053
pull back on serotonin and so on,

1363
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:46,740
but that there are particular tools,

1364
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,227
both behavioral and supplementation-based,

1365
00:51:48,227 --> 00:51:50,310
and to some extent,

1366
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,510
prescription drug based, too,

1367
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,520
and we'll touch on a few of those.

1368
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,070
If you understand that and why they work,

1369
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,880
well, then you can create a sort of kit,

1370
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,030
a grab bag of things that
you can use in any context

1371
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,580
or I should say that you can look to

1372
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,500
depending on the context you're in

1373
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,380
and create the states of
body and mind that you want.

1374
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,410
Now once again, painting
with a somewhat broad brush,

1375
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,810
but nonetheless, an accurate brush,

1376
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,360
we can say that dopamine,

1377
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,960
when elevated above baseline,

1378
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,110
tends to increase states of motivation,

1379
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:28,140
both mental and physical motivation,

1380
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,843
drive and to some extent focus.

1381
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,200
I've said it many times
before, and I'll say it again,

1382
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,900
there's a lot of
misconception about dopamine.

1383
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,030
Many people out there think that dopamine

1384
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,320
is all about pleasure.

1385
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,470
You hear about dopamine hits
or people chasing dopamine

1386
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,560
or the need to have a
dopamine fast, et cetera.

1387
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,910
Dopamine is not about pleasure.

1388
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:52,260
Dopamine is about motivation,
craving and pursuit

1389
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,740
for goals or for things that are outside

1390
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,380
our immediate possession and experience.

1391
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,930
The motivation and pursuit of a mate.

1392
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,330
The motivation and pursuit to mate.

1393
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,190
The motivation and pursuit of food.

1394
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,560
The motivation and
pursuit of a career goal,

1395
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,940
et cetera, et cetera,

1396
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,810
things we do not yet
have, but that we want

1397
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,020
and we get into sort of
a forward center of mass

1398
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,120
and a pursuit of, and that
pursuit can be physical.

1399
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,590
That pursuit can be cognitive.

1400
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,500
It can be both cognitive and physical.

1401
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,260
And it can involve talking
about something, right?

1402
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,340
Because in some professions,

1403
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,840
pursuit of things involves talking.

1404
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,980
I think about lawyers,

1405
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,130
they talk a lot in
pursuit of winning cases

1406
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,300
and money, et cetera,

1407
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,310
putting people in jail or
keeping people out of jail,

1408
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,810
et cetera, that's done with their mouths,

1409
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,220
not with their bodies.

1410
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,980
Athletes in a state of motivated training

1411
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,010
or in motivated competition
use their bodies.

1412
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,450
All this is obvious of course,

1413
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,610
but perhaps what is not so obvious

1414
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,910
is that one molecule not working alone,

1415
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,490
but predominantly one molecule, dopamine,

1416
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,980
is responsible for all of
those motivated states,

1417
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,790
which again, underscores the
power of these neuromodulators.

1418
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,140
So dopamine, we can think of

1419
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,420
at least in the context
of today's discussion

1420
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,020
as controlling and indeed
promoting motivation,

1421
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,120
drive and pursuit

1422
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,983
and to some extent, focus.

1423
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,060
Epinephrine and a closely related molecule

1424
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,660
called norepinephrine

1425
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,870
and again, I want to emphasize

1426
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,850
that epinephrine is adrenaline

1427
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,950
and adrenaline is epinephrine.

1428
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,140
Norepinephrine is noradrenaline

1429
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,120
and noradrenaline is norepinephrine,

1430
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,980
but today we're going to
just simply talk about

1431
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,693
epinephrine and norepinephrine.

1432
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,990
That category of neuromodulator

1433
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:38,670
is mainly responsible for
generating our energy,

1434
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,100
our level of fuel

1435
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,680
and baseline level of

1436
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,350
forward center of mass,
as I like to call it.

1437
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,440
You can also think of it
as how high your RPM are.

1438
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,910
Now we're not a car

1439
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,190
and the car analogy sort of falls apart

1440
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,500
as we go further into the biology,

1441
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,420
but it's a decent one for now.

1442
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,890
When epinephrine levels are high,

1443
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,390
we tend to feel agitated,

1444
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,860
we tend to feel like we want to move,

1445
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,590
we tend to feel like we
can't shut down our thinking

1446
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,080
and our anticipation of
what's going to happen next.

1447
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,660
And when epinephrine
levels are very, very low,

1448
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,670
we actually have less physical energy.

1449
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,980
We tend to have less mental energy

1450
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,830
in terms of generating
thoughts very quickly

1451
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,880
and so on and so forth.

1452
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,440
And as I mentioned before,

1453
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,140
dopamine and epinephrine
are closely related

1454
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,230
so much so that we know for a fact

1455
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,720
that epinephrine is actually manufactured

1456
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,340
from the molecule dopamine.

1457
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,230
So that's why I'm talking
about these two neuromodulators

1458
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,880
in very close juxtaposition

1459
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,790
because they do indeed
collaborate with one another.

1460
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,040
But for sake of today's discussion,

1461
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,220
we can just think of epinephrine
as increasing energy,

1462
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,370
adrenaline increases energy
in our state of readiness.

1463
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:48,150
It also, I should mention,
activates our immune system.

1464
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,830
Contrary to popular belief

1465
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,050
that stress inhibits our immune system,

1466
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,520
epinephrine is deployed,

1467
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,250
it's released at great
levels in our brain and body

1468
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,180
when we are stressed.

1469
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,980
And that actually protects us

1470
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,100
against infections of multiple kinds,

1471
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,450
at least in the short-term.

1472
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,390
That and all the details of that

1473
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,280
and tools related to that

1474
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,560
were covered in our episode
on the immune system,

1475
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,270
if you want to check that out.

1476
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,000
Now the neuromodulator serotonin

1477
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,850
creates a number of different
states in the brain and body,

1478
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,980
but for sake of today's discussion,

1479
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,470
we're going to think about
the predominant states

1480
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,303
that it creates

1481
00:56:23,303 --> 00:56:26,400
and those are states of contentness,

1482
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,070
being happy, feeling fairly relaxed,

1483
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,470
feeling soothed and to some extent,

1484
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:35,283
even some relief from
pain or lack of pain.

1485
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:39,240
Serotonin is associated
with a feeling of satiety

1486
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,690
of having enough of what we already have.

1487
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,770
Now when serotonin is very, very high,

1488
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,780
people can even be sedate.

1489
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,660
They can be completely amotivated,

1490
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,700
no motivation to seek out things

1491
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,013
like food or sex or work or et cetera.

1492
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,340
Whereas when serotonin
levels are very low,

1493
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,500
people can actually exhibit agitation

1494
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,480
and high levels of stress.

1495
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,160
So the levels matter here,

1496
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,893
but again, for sake of
today's conversation,

1497
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,230
when we leverage serotonin,

1498
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,810
we are really leveraging a neuromodulator

1499
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,850
that tends to increase the activity

1500
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,590
of neural circuits in the brain and body

1501
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,260
that make us feel relaxed and happy.

1502
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,130
And it tends to decrease the
activity of neural circuits

1503
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,260
that make us rabidly in pursuit of things

1504
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,210
that we don't have, right.

1505
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,480
The opposite of content and sated

1506
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,510
is motivation, desire
and hunger and thirst

1507
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,040
for things that we don't have.

1508
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,060
So serotonin is the molecule of peace.

1509
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,950
It is the molecule of contentness.

1510
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:43,800
It is the molecule of having enough,

1511
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,600
at least for the time being

1512
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,090
or the feeling that we have
enough for the time being.

1513
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,210
Now acetylcholine is a fourth
category of neuromodulator

1514
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,430
that as I mentioned earlier,
is somewhat not totally,

1515
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,070
but somewhat distinct
from any direct control

1516
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,230
by the major hormone systems of the body,

1517
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,350
or at least the major
steroid hormone systems.

1518
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,390
And acetylcholine we can say

1519
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:08,390
is mainly associated with states of focus.

1520
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,470
And we can go a step further and say

1521
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,140
that it's mainly associated
with steps of focus

1522
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,290
as they relate to learning
and encoding new information,

1523
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,600
so called neuroplasticity.

1524
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,280
Now neuroplasticity,

1525
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,500
or the brain and nervous
system's ability to change

1526
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,550
in response to experience

1527
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,710
can be impacted by an enormous number

1528
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,200
of different chemicals,
not just acetylcholine,

1529
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,520
but acetylcholine has a
particularly potent ability

1530
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,600
to open up the thing that
we call neuroplasticity

1531
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,910
to allow plasticity to
happen in one moment

1532
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,440
whereas in a previous moment,

1533
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,730
it could not occur

1534
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:45,630
because acetylcholine had not
been released in the brain

1535
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,850
or in the spinal cord.

1536
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:51,420
So acetylcholine is involved
in focus and in learning,

1537
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:55,140
but it is not necessarily
always associated

1538
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,590
with learning in the
context of highly motivated,

1539
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,450
really ramped up states.

1540
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,650
It can be,

1541
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,770
but acetylcholine can also be released

1542
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,510
and can encourage the learning

1543
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,543
and neuroplasticity
associated with calm states.

1544
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,040
For instance, if somebody
has a newborn child,

1545
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,510
we know that they are
flooded with oxytocin,

1546
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,520
which has actually even
been called the love hormone

1547
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,730
or it does many things in
addition to control feelings

1548
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,380
of romantic attachment

1549
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,540
and attachment to children, et cetera.

1550
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,150
It does all of that, but it
does a lot more, as well.

1551
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,700
But when people have a new child,

1552
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,010
they also tend to be
hyper-focused on that child,

1553
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,030
not just its well-being,

1554
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,430
but they narrow all their thinking,

1555
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:39,960
all their vision,

1556
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,640
all their hearing to that child

1557
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,220
and there are obvious adaptive reasons

1558
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,480
for wanting to do that.

1559
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,640
I recall a family dinner we had.

1560
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,530
Gosh, this was over 10 years ago.

1561
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,630
We had a couple over.

1562
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,880
My mom was in the habit
of inviting people over

1563
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,770
who didn't have places
to go on the holidays,

1564
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:56,970
'cause that's just who she is

1565
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,800
and I think it's quite nice.

1566
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,200
So she brought over this
couple, they had a newborn,

1567
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,130
I think this baby had been born

1568
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,420
maybe two or three weeks before

1569
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,480
and it was seated or not seated [laughs].

1570
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,740
It was lying down.

1571
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,573
I couldn't see it.

1572
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:09,406
It was like a potato bug.

1573
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,320
It could barely hold its head up.

1574
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,290
But it was lying in a
little bassinet on the floor

1575
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,190
as we ate dinner.

1576
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:17,430
And it was almost hilarious,
it actually was hilarious.

1577
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:18,630
We laughed a lot about this,

1578
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:20,250
that the entire meal,

1579
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,530
they were basically staring at this baby.

1580
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,020
They were so clearly in love with the baby

1581
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,830
and so flooded with
oxytocin and also prolactin

1582
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,350
that they couldn't take
their focus off this baby.

1583
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,080
It was actually really
wonderful and endearing to see.

1584
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,360
But in addition to that,

1585
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,410
I'd be willing to bet

1586
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,630
had I been able to do a
little bit of microdialysis,

1587
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,930
which is a ability to

1588
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:44,610
measure the amounts of neuromodulator

1589
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,780
given location in the brain,

1590
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,070
had I been able to do
that experiment on them

1591
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,820
in that moment, I
would've found that levels

1592
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,920
of acetylcholine were exceedingly high

1593
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,190
because they were so
hyper-focused on this child,

1594
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,280
not just in love with,
but focused on that child.

1595
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,500
And without a doubt,

1596
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,210
the neural circuits related to focus

1597
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,250
and plasticity were heavily engaged

1598
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,940
again for obvious adaptive
reasons related to child rearing

1599
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,460
and learning the coos and cries

1600
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,580
and pain signals and pleasure
signals of one's offspring.

1601
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,250
So we have dopamine
associated with motivation,

1602
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,310
drive and pursuit and
to some extent, focus.

1603
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,530
We have epinephrine and
norepinephrine associated

1604
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:26,190
with energy of having a
forward center of mass,

1605
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,960
mentally and or physically.

1606
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,040
We have serotonin,

1607
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,470
which is associated with a peaceful,

1608
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,470
content, sated state of being.

1609
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,970
And we have acetylcholine,

1610
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:38,970
which is associated with focus

1611
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:41,340
and in particular focus
as it relates to learning

1612
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,530
and encoding new information.

1613
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,180
So let's say you want
to be more motivated.

1614
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,820
You want to be more in pursuit of goals.

1615
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,790
And you want to have more
energy and to be more focused.

1616
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,410
There are many ways to go about that.

1617
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:56,070
In fact, there's a near
infinite cloud of opportunities,

1618
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,130
everything from prescription
drugs to illicit drugs,

1619
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,920
which I certainly do not recommend,

1620
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,990
supplements, nutrition.

1621
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,790
You can listen to particular music.

1622
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,670
You can do all sorts of
cognitive behavioral,

1623
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,740
nutritional supplementation tricks.

1624
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,740
Or you can just understand

1625
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,890
that what you're really after
are increases in dopamine

1626
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,770
above baseline that you control

1627
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,830
and there are ways to control
them that are quite potent

1628
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,680
and science tells us which tools

1629
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,210
are going to be the most potent

1630
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,820
and the most versatile for you.

1631
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,770
So I'm going to share
those tools with you now

1632
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:35,250
with the caveat that
each one of those tools

1633
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,887
could be its own entire podcast episode,

1634
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,620
and that we've done near entire episodes

1635
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,260
on each of these tools or small
collections of these tools.

1636
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,960
So I'm going to cover these in
somewhat superficial manner.

1637
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,180
We can provide links to previous episodes

1638
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,460
that relate to each of
these tools in detail,

1639
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,800
but I'll give you enough detail about them

1640
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,990
that would allow you to
incorporate them into your routine

1641
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,190
should you choose.

1642
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,630
Let's say you want to increase dopamine

1643
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,493
for sake of increasing motivation.

1644
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,160
The first thing to do is

1645
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,040
to understand what the
natural behavioral tools are

1646
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,240
for increasing dopamine

1647
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,180
and to do those as
consistently as possible.

1648
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,160
Again, these are tools
that you'll want to do

1649
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,520
nearly every day, if not every day.

1650
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,430
And I know I'm sounding like
a broken record on this one,

1651
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:21,000
but here again, we come to sunlight

1652
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,770
and I should say,

1653
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,110
not just the desire to,

1654
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,490
but really the need

1655
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,100
for viewing the maximum amount of sunlight

1656
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,600
that one can reasonably get

1657
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,730
given schedules and
locations in the world,

1658
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:34,110
time of year, et cetera,

1659
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,560
in the early part of the day,

1660
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,690
within the first hour of waking, ideally,

1661
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,060
but certainly in the first
three hours of your day,

1662
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,610
you are going to want to
maximize sunlight exposure

1663
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:45,443
to your eyes.

1664
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:48,480
Never look at the sun or
any other light so bright

1665
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,530
that it's painful to look at.

1666
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,940
And yes, of course blinking is fine,

1667
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,380
but no, take sunglasses off,

1668
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,970
go outside once the sun is out

1669
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,590
and get some natural light in your eyes.

1670
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:57,810
And if it's appropriate

1671
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,120
or I should say in a
way that's appropriate,

1672
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,550
maximize the amount of
sunlight exposure to your skin,

1673
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,770
but please don't get burned.

1674
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,830
Please do wear sunscreen if
you're prone to getting burned.

1675
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:10,410
Typically early day sunlight
is not going to burn you,

1676
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:11,760
at least not most people,

1677
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,070
unless you're extremely fair-skinned.

1678
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,903
So don't get burned.

1679
01:04:14,903 --> 01:04:17,370
Do what you need to in order
to protect yourself from burn.

1680
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,160
There's some emerging
controversy about sunscreen

1681
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,810
and which ones are safe
and which ones aren't safe.

1682
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,490
We have not done an episode on that yet,

1683
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:26,370
but I find it to be an
important and interesting topic.

1684
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,800
Darya Rose, Dr. Darya Rose, I should say,

1685
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,990
has a podcast called
The Darya Rose Podcast

1686
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,600
and did an episode all about sunscreens,

1687
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,340
which are safe, which are not safe,

1688
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,810
by interviewing an expert on that

1689
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,300
so I refer you to that podcast
as it relates to sunscreen.

1690
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,120
But get some natural light
exposure in your eyes.

1691
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,520
And if you wake up
before the sun comes out,

1692
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,140
turn on as many bright lights inside

1693
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,600
as you can turn on reasonably

1694
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,920
given your electric bill, et cetera.

1695
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,650
Get a lot of bright sunlight
exposure early in the day

1696
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:55,410
and get a lot of sunlight
exposure to your skin

1697
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,850
in the early part of the day,

1698
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,310
in a way that doesn't burn you,

1699
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:01,410
meaning burn your skin
or blind you, please.

1700
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,660
Please don't do anything
that harms your vision

1701
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,780
like stare into a bright
light, that's painful.

1702
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,860
What does that do?

1703
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,930
Well, it sets in motion a number

1704
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:11,490
of different biological cascades.

1705
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,960
Some are very fast.

1706
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,430
There are fast actions of sunlight

1707
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,600
that will trigger for instance,

1708
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,090
dopamine release from
different parts of your brain

1709
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,710
and your endocrine system.

1710
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:23,730
And we now know that it
increases levels of genes

1711
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,200
related to thyroid hormone

1712
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,740
and actually increases
certain dopamine receptors.

1713
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,790
So there's a wonderful paper.

1714
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,740
We will provide a link to this paper

1715
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,390
that shows that sunlight exposure

1716
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:37,020
can actually increase the
amount of so-called DRD4.

1717
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,697
This is a particular type
of dopamine receptor,

1718
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:41,040
the dopamine receptor four.

1719
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,690
The genes for dopamine receptor four

1720
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:44,520
are actually under photic control.

1721
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,350
So if you get sunlight
exposure to your eyes

1722
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,183
and it does have to be to your eyes

1723
01:05:47,183 --> 01:05:48,780
in the early part of the day,

1724
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,450
you increase the amount of
dopamine receptor that you have,

1725
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:53,550
which allows whatever circulating dopamine

1726
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,690
happens to be there

1727
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,330
to have a greater effect on motivation

1728
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,520
and I should say also on mood and feelings

1729
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,370
of being in pursuit and generally,

1730
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,250
in craving and pursuit of things in life.

1731
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,560
Now there's another way
to increase the effect

1732
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,750
of whatever dopamine
happens to be circulating

1733
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,400
in your brain and body.

1734
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,550
And this again, relates
to increasing the number

1735
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:18,390
or the efficacy of the
receptors for dopamine.

1736
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:21,060
Now here we're not talking about
the dopamine receptor four,

1737
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,280
but a different category
of dopamine receptors,

1738
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,260
the D2 and D3 receptors,

1739
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,140
which are expressed multiple
places in your brain and body

1740
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,580
and bind dopamine,

1741
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,040
meaning dopamine parks in
them like a parking spot

1742
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,870
and allows dopamine

1743
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,380
to generally increase the
activity of the neurons

1744
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,930
and cells that express
those dopamine receptors.

1745
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,100
How do you do that?

1746
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:45,300
Well, turns out that regular
ingestion of caffeine

1747
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,100
at safe and appropriate levels,

1748
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,100
about a hundred to 250 milligrams

1749
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,544
is going to increase the number of D2

1750
01:06:52,544 --> 01:06:54,090
and D3 dopamine receptors.

1751
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,030
I talked a little bit about
this on a previous episode.

1752
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,950
Again, we'll provide
links to these studies,

1753
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,240
but this is an important finding,

1754
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,300
I believe, because this
is not about the acute,

1755
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,460
the immediate effects of
caffeine on alertness,

1756
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,840
although those occur, too.

1757
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,220
When you drink caffeine,

1758
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,980
it's going to increase
your levels of adrenaline

1759
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,360
and so-called epinephrine,

1760
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,740
which will increase your energy levels.

1761
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,530
It's going to decrease levels
of something called adenosine,

1762
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:17,880
which builds up while you're sleepy.

1763
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,740
It's going to make you feel
less sleepy, more alert,

1764
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,820
more energetic.

1765
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,200
That's sort of obvious.

1766
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,780
But what's less obvious is
that it's increasing the number

1767
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,850
and efficacy of dopamine receptors

1768
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:28,860
so that whatever dopamine
happens to be around

1769
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,820
in your system is going to
have more of a potent effect.

1770
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,500
So how much caffeine should you drink?

1771
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,970
That's going to vary
from person to person.

1772
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:39,210
Some people are very sensitive
to caffeine, others are not.

1773
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,120
I tend to be fairly
insensitive to caffeine,

1774
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,310
'cause I've been drinking it
for a long period of time.

1775
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,760
But you know, after one or two
cups of espresso or coffee,

1776
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,930
I feel like I've had enough.

1777
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:50,670
I tend to drink my
caffeine early in the day,

1778
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,230
which is what I'm going
to recommend that you do,

1779
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:55,260
not drinking caffeine past
two and certainly not 4:00 PM,

1780
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,400
if you're on a typical schedule

1781
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,080
and you want to be able
to sleep that night,

1782
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,880
even if you can fall asleep.

1783
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,770
Having too much caffeine
in your system is not good

1784
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,690
because it disrupts the
architecture of sleep.

1785
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,720
And now knowing about all
the metabolic variability

1786
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,420
across the night, according
to different stages of sleep,

1787
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,850
it should be even more obvious

1788
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,590
as to why disrupting the
architecture of sleep

1789
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,640
would be bad for you.

1790
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,710
So limit that caffeine
intake to early in the day

1791
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:18,720
and don't go ballistic.

1792
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,160
Certainly don't go ballistic in any case,

1793
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,569
but for most people anywhere

1794
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:24,539
from 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine

1795
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,250
is going to have this effect.

1796
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,250
And this effect again is
a slow accumulating effect

1797
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,170
by drinking caffeine
consistently day-to-day.

1798
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,689
I get my caffeine mainly
from Yerba Mate tea.

1799
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,189
I want to emphasize that
it's probably a good idea

1800
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:36,929
to stay away from the smoked mates.

1801
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,000
There's some evidence
those can be carcinogenic,

1802
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,189
but I brew my own Yerba Mate tea,

1803
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,079
or sometimes I'll drink
coffee or espresso,

1804
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,340
or sometimes both frankly,

1805
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,410
as long as I'm hydrating enough
and I'm getting enough salt,

1806
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,840
then I tend to feel fine
with that much caffeine.

1807
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,729
The other way to increase dopamine

1808
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:52,799
and to make sure that your
baseline levels of dopamine

1809
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,970
are high enough is to make sure

1810
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,170
that you're eating sufficient numbers

1811
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,850
of tyrosine-rich foods.

1812
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,983
You can look up which
foods include tyrosine.

1813
01:08:58,983 --> 01:09:01,649
Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine.

1814
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:04,799
It's an amino acid that
is in direct pathway

1815
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,240
to dopamine synthesis

1816
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,939
and tyrosine foods include things like

1817
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:11,639
certain meats, Parmesan cheese,

1818
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,859
very high in tyrosine, for instance.

1819
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,809
In fact, there's something
called the cheese effect,

1820
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:16,643
believe it or not.

1821
01:09:16,643 --> 01:09:17,850
I don't want to go too far off topic,

1822
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,350
but the cheese effect
is kind of interesting

1823
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:23,010
because certain people
will take antidepressants

1824
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,680
that are so called MAO inhibitors,

1825
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,050
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

1826
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,060
Anytime you hear ASE, that's an enzyme.

1827
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,560
They will take these inhibitors

1828
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,340
that prevent the breakdown of dopamine

1829
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,319
and other so-called catacholamines,

1830
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:39,869
which allow more dopamine
to be in circulation.

1831
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:42,479
But if these people eat certain cheeses,

1832
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,059
including Parmesan cheese,
and there are other foods,

1833
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,160
of course that include not just tyrosine,

1834
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,173
but one of the derivatives of tyrosine,

1835
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,750
called tyramine,

1836
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:54,660
that generates what's
called the cheese effect,

1837
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,580
which is people get potent migraines,

1838
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,350
headaches, blood pressure goes up.

1839
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,540
Why, well, because they've
got a lot of tyrosine

1840
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,580
in their system and
dopamine in their system.

1841
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,740
And they've got less of the enzyme

1842
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,800
that removes that dopamine
or limits its action

1843
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,810
and so they have an excess of dopamine

1844
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:13,020
and dopamine has effects on
blood pressure, et cetera.

1845
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,790
So the cheese effect is something to avoid

1846
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,800
if you are somebody who's taking drugs

1847
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,190
that tap into or manipulate
the dopamine pathway,

1848
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,750
either for Parkinson's or depressions,

1849
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,070
obviously you're going
to want to be careful

1850
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:27,810
about adjusting up or down
levels of dopamine too potently.

1851
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,070
So mind the cheese effect

1852
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:31,260
if you're taking an MAO inhibitor.

1853
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,060
There's a lot of information
about this online.

1854
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,820
For most people, eating
foods like Parmesan cheese,

1855
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,540
eating foods like certain
meats and certain vegetables

1856
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,460
also can increase tyrosine levels,

1857
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,800
which will increase dopamine synthesis.

1858
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,020
So these are ways of
modulating, more or less,

1859
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,930
the baseline of dopamine
that you are able to produce

1860
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:51,870
and the ways that dopamine
can have its action

1861
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:54,783
by way of binding to
receptors more potently.

1862
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,290
Now there are other ways
to increase dopamine

1863
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,540
in a more acute or directed way,

1864
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,790
ways to spike your dopamine,

1865
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:07,790
to enhance your state of
motivation, mood, focus and so on.

1866
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:11,760
And in thinking about the
vast landscape of tools

1867
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,593
that can do that,

1868
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:14,430
we have one category of tools,

1869
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,870
which are the really, really bad things

1870
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,280
that I don't recommend anybody do.

1871
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,590
In fact, I recommend nobody do ever,

1872
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,890
which are things like cocaine,
methamphetamine, et cetera.

1873
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,860
They are incredibly destructive for lives

1874
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,530
because of the way that they
so potently increase dopamine

1875
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,990
and then the crash in
dopamine that occurs later.

1876
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,510
I mean, they can indeed
and often do ruin lives.

1877
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:35,700
So we're leaving those off the table.

1878
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:39,270
There are of course, prescription
drugs that many people,

1879
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:43,230
especially people who have
clinically diagnosed ADHD,

1880
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,210
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1881
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:48,510
rely on and in fact
benefit from in many cases,

1882
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:52,080
things like Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse.

1883
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,930
Nowadays, there's also
a lot of interest in use

1884
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,820
of things like Modafinil, Armodafinil.

1885
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:59,640
I covered all of those
in the episode on ADHD.

1886
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,380
And you can find that on HubermanLab.com

1887
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,530
and the other places
this podcast is found.

1888
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:07,350
Prescription drugs aside because
they require a prescription

1889
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,210
and a discussion that's in-depth

1890
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:12,330
and appropriate with your
physician, healthcare provider.

1891
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:15,450
There are supplements
that can very potently

1892
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:17,160
increase dopamine as well,

1893
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,330
perhaps not to the extent

1894
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,850
that some of those other
prescription drugs can,

1895
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,950
but certainly to a degree that will impact

1896
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:25,020
and increase dopamine and motivation

1897
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,820
and the other states
dopamine is associated with.

1898
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,730
And the two main categories of supplements

1899
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,830
that are very effective
in raising dopamine

1900
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:33,330
and here I should provide the caveat

1901
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:35,220
that anytime you're going
to add or remove anything

1902
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:38,040
from your supplementation protocols,

1903
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,540
please talk to a physician

1904
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,340
who is knowledgeable on these topics.

1905
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,320
If you're somebody who has,

1906
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,350
or is taking drugs for
depression or mania,

1907
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:49,080
please be very cautious about
manipulating your dopamine

1908
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,040
in any case.

1909
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,420
I don't just say that to protect us,

1910
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,803
I say that to protect you.

1911
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,160
But if we were to look at
the supplement landscape

1912
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,140
and ask which supplement
increased dopamine,

1913
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,270
there are a vast number of them,

1914
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:02,760
but the three main ones,

1915
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,190
the most effective ones that
are readily available out there

1916
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:07,680
without a prescription
are mucuna pruriens.

1917
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,320
This is actually the
outside of a velvety bean

1918
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,377
that has been extracted
and put into a supplement.

1919
01:13:12,377 --> 01:13:15,510
Mucuna pruriens is actual L-dopa.

1920
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:18,990
It's 99% L-dopa, which
is a prescription drug

1921
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:22,230
that is given for Parkinson's
and for other purposes

1922
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,710
where increasing dopamine is important.

1923
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,720
I don't recommend mucuna pruriens.

1924
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,250
I'm not saying that no one should take it,

1925
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,450
but I don't take it.

1926
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:31,410
And I don't recommend it

1927
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,780
because it tends to so potently

1928
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,250
and acutely increase dopamine,

1929
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,040
that there's a pretty
substantial crash afterwards.

1930
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,650
So I avoid it and I
don't generally suggest

1931
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,430
that anyone take it unless
there's really a clinical need,

1932
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,290
or they're working very
closely with somebody

1933
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:48,480
that can really monitor that.

1934
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,080
The other two supplements
that can increase dopamine

1935
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,730
in a short-term way,

1936
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,070
but in a significant way,

1937
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,050
are L-tyrosine

1938
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:59,730
so you can buy that as
a supplement amino acid.

1939
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:00,750
I sometimes take this.

1940
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,380
I would say, I probably take
it about once a week maximum

1941
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,140
for work bouts or workouts.

1942
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,940
I'll take it in dosages of anywhere

1943
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,250
from 500 milligrams to
a thousand milligrams.

1944
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,740
People vary tremendously
in their sensitivity

1945
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,240
to supplementing L-tyrosine.

1946
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,250
I know people that can take two grams.

1947
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,100
I know people that can barely
take a hundred milligrams.

1948
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,720
I know people that the best dose for them

1949
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,860
is zero milligrams.

1950
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,380
So there's a lot of variation
there depending on sensitivity

1951
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,590
and they're natural
baseline levels of dopamine

1952
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,090
and whether or not they're
doing a lot of other things

1953
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,830
to support dopamine,

1954
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,840
but nonetheless, taking
L-tyrosine will lead

1955
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,600
to fairly substantial
increases in dopamine

1956
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,670
within about 15 to 45 minutes

1957
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,940
and it lasts for about
30 minutes to two hours

1958
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,710
and then there's kind of a tapering off.

1959
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,780
Some people experience a
little bit of an emotional

1960
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,620
and or I should say energetic
crash, some people don't.

1961
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:52,410
And then the other supplement
that I certainly use,

1962
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:53,790
and that I know a number
of other people use

1963
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,380
is more fast-acting, but more potent,

1964
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,210
which is phenylethylamine.

1965
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,540
This relates to the
so-called PEA molecule,

1966
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,370
PEA, P-E-A,

1967
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:05,670
and phenylethylamine increases dopamine

1968
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,680
and some metabolites related to dopamine

1969
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,390
in ways that really increase energy

1970
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:11,070
and feelings of well-being and motivation.

1971
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,750
And again, it's fast-acting.

1972
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,010
So my particular protocol,

1973
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,190
the one I use is I'll
take phenylethylamine

1974
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:19,830
at dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams

1975
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,620
along with some L-tyrosine,

1976
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,710
or I'll take it on its
own with a molecule,

1977
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:26,700
or I should say a compound

1978
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:27,780
that we'll talk about a little bit later

1979
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,330
as it relates to acetylcholine, Alpha-GPC,

1980
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:33,270
but tyrosine and phenylethylamine
taken alone or together

1981
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:36,060
will make you feel more
motivated and more alert,

1982
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,940
more willing and able to lean into

1983
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,290
particular motivated behaviors,

1984
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,420
whether or not they're
physical or cognitive.

1985
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,820
If you'd like to learn
more about these compounds

1986
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,890
and their supplementation
and their effects,

1987
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,420
I encourage you to check out

1988
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,270
the ever valuable website, examine.com.

1989
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,860
It's zero cost to access,

1990
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,500
and they provide references
and some more details

1991
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,770
about these sorts of compounds
and other related compounds.

1992
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,870
Now if we are going to
look at behavioral tools

1993
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:03,120
for potently increasing dopamine,

1994
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,460
that too is a vast landscape.

1995
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,690
And we know based on hundreds,
if not thousands of studies

1996
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:13,650
that things like winning
at some sort of competition

1997
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,810
or succeeding in reaching a goal

1998
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,400
can certainly increase dopamine.

1999
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,020
We talk a lot about this in the episode

2000
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,510
on dopamine, motivation and drive,

2001
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,220
but leaving that aside,

2002
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,440
there are certain behavioral protocols

2003
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,460
that are unrelated to your
overall goals and motivations

2004
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,040
that can increase dopamine
in a very sustained way.

2005
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,780
And without question,

2006
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,360
the most potent behavioral
tool for doing that

2007
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,570
is going to be deliberate, cold exposure.

2008
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:43,230
Deliberate cold exposure has
been talked about a lot here

2009
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:46,410
and elsewhere in terms of its

2010
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:49,770
ability to do things
like reduce inflammation

2011
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:52,620
as a way to test and improve resilience

2012
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,840
because uncomfortable cold,

2013
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,580
provided its applied safely

2014
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,740
is a great way to learn
to be more resilient

2015
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,080
because you're essentially
staying or forcing yourself

2016
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,430
to stay in a circumstance

2017
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:05,010
where your system is
flooded with adrenaline.

2018
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:10,010
But one lesser known aspect
of deliberate cold exposure

2019
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,580
is one that's been demonstrated

2020
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,080
quite convincingly in humans,

2021
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,060
comes from a study
published in the year 2000.

2022
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,110
I'll link to this study.

2023
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:18,630
I love this study by the way.

2024
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,160
Covered it many times on this podcast

2025
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,430
because I love it so much and
I think it's truly important.

2026
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,490
And that's the study from Srámek et al,

2027
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,207
entitled, "Human physiological responses

2028
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:30,420
"to immersion into water
of different temperatures".

2029
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,250
I'm not going to go into
this into a ton of detail

2030
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,420
for sake of time,

2031
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,520
but basically what they show is that

2032
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,690
putting people into cold water,

2033
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,790
and I should mention
the water that they used

2034
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,200
in this study wasn't that cold.

2035
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,400
They had a bunch of different conditions,

2036
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,530
but they had people that
got into, for instance,

2037
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:46,470
60 degree Fahrenheit
water for up to two hours,

2038
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:48,044
had them sitting there,

2039
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:49,470
had them in a lawn chair up to their neck,

2040
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:54,420
had very long sustained increases
in dopamine transmission

2041
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,930
and dopamine circulation
in their brain and body.

2042
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:00,840
And also some of the other catacholamines,

2043
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,673
as I mentioned before,

2044
01:18:01,673 --> 01:18:03,540
dopamine tends to
collaborate with epinephrine

2045
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,250
and vice versa.

2046
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,110
Now you don't need to put yourself

2047
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,940
into 60 degree Fahrenheit water

2048
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,100
to get these kind of sustained increases.

2049
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,700
And you certainly don't
need to do it for two hours.

2050
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,140
We have a strong reason to believe

2051
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,820
based on subsequent studies,

2052
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:19,800
in fact, published just this last year,

2053
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,800
that getting into much colder water

2054
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,810
of say 50 degrees or 55 degrees

2055
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,450
or even 45 degrees Fahrenheit

2056
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:30,600
can potently increase dopamine
and epinephrine, as well.

2057
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,160
And that you don't need to expose yourself

2058
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,590
to that cold water for nearly as long.

2059
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:38,940
So perhaps even as short as
one minute or even 30 seconds

2060
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,680
exposure to really cold water,

2061
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,520
can lead to these potent
long-lasting increases in dopamine.

2062
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,010
Many people will ask
which protocols to follow.

2063
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,350
For instance, will a cold shower suffice?

2064
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,630
Very likely, yes, if your
shower gets cold enough.

2065
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,490
Do you need ice floating in the bath?

2066
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:55,080
No, it's all about the temperature

2067
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,150
not whether or not there's
ice present or not.

2068
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,350
How long to stay in there?

2069
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,700
There are a lot of details

2070
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,590
that we don't have time
to go into this episode.

2071
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:05,070
Please see the episode on
the Use of Deliberate Cold

2072
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,390
for Health and Performance.

2073
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,100
You'll find that at HubermanLab.com.

2074
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,690
We have a newsletter related to this.

2075
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,850
It gets into a lot of detailed protocols,

2076
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,430
but in general, we can say

2077
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:17,610
that the way to evoke dopamine
and epinephrine release

2078
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:20,040
using cold water is to

2079
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,020
ideally you would do cold water immersion.

2080
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,120
If you can't, you'd use cold shower,

2081
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,880
but you want to use a
temperature that is safe,

2082
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,530
meaning you're not going
to have a heart attack,

2083
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,700
but that is uncomfortable

2084
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,170
such that you really want to get out

2085
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,960
and then staying in for
anywhere from one minute

2086
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,630
to 10 minutes, depending on
how cold adapted you are,

2087
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:38,130
and then getting out

2088
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:39,780
and drying off and going about your day,

2089
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,010
unless you have some other protocol

2090
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,840
that you're trying to
extract from the cold.

2091
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,180
So this is a cold exposure protocol

2092
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,570
specifically aimed at increasing dopamine.

2093
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,490
For some people out there, you might think

2094
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:53,370
this is kind of silly using
cold water to increase dopamine.

2095
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:56,130
But when you look at the data in humans

2096
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:58,080
on the effect of cold water exposure

2097
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,290
to stimulate long-lasting,
very significant increases

2098
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,880
in dopamine and epinephrine,

2099
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,330
I think you'll agree that
this is a really potent tool

2100
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,870
that provided its given
safely and gone about safely,

2101
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:12,090
is giving you the kinds
of increases in dopamine

2102
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:14,940
that you would seek using
prescription pharmacology.

2103
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,770
Now it shouldn't be used as a replacement

2104
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,540
for prescription pharmacology,

2105
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,790
although people have done that to success.

2106
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:23,670
One of the previous guest
on the Huberman Lab Podcast

2107
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,320
was Dr. Anna Lembke, our director

2108
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,570
of the Dual Diagnosis
Addiction Clinic at Stanford.

2109
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,730
She has an amazing book
called "Dopamine Nation",

2110
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,940
all about dopamine and
both its uses, healthy,

2111
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,430
and its perils in things like addiction.

2112
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,070
And she describes a patient of hers

2113
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:39,780
that used deliberate cold exposure

2114
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,730
to try and maintain dopamine levels

2115
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:43,320
while coming off of drugs

2116
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,990
that were increasing dopamine so potently

2117
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:48,090
that they were putting him
down the path of addiction.

2118
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:51,630
So the use of cold water
for increasing dopamine

2119
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,860
is a real tool.

2120
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,900
It's, I would say, a power tool.

2121
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,265
In fact, it's the kind
of thing that if you want

2122
01:20:57,265 --> 01:20:59,700
to increase dopamine
for sake of motivation,

2123
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,230
it might be your first go-to

2124
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:02,730
provided you're also doing the things

2125
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:04,410
to maintain dopamine baseline

2126
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,480
like sunlight exposure in particular,

2127
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,130
making sure you're
getting sufficient amounts

2128
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,620
of tyrosine-containing foods and so on.

2129
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,790
And now just very briefly,

2130
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:14,100
I want to point to a few quick tools

2131
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,850
that good peer review data tell us

2132
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,070
can be leveraged in order to make sure

2133
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:22,590
that you have sufficient
dopamine when you want it

2134
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:24,930
or that it's available
for it to be released

2135
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:27,960
by any number of the
tools I provided thus far.

2136
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,260
And those are sufficient
number of B vitamins.

2137
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,140
So it turns out that B vitamins,

2138
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,170
in particular B6 or vitamin B6,

2139
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:40,050
can potently reduce prolactin levels.

2140
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:42,390
And again, prolactin and
dopamine tend to work

2141
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,070
in kind of push pull fashion.

2142
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,990
That said you should be cautious

2143
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,930
about taking excessive levels of B6.

2144
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,970
It is a vitamin that if you take too much,

2145
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:52,830
you'll likely excrete
it through your urine,

2146
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:54,750
but there is evidence that having

2147
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,910
excessively high levels of B6

2148
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:59,490
or supplementing with
excessively high levels of B6

2149
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,350
can cause some peripheral neuropathy,

2150
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,630
some death of nerves in the periphery.

2151
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:05,580
If you want to know what dosage
levels are relevant there

2152
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,720
just simply look it up online.

2153
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,250
There's a lot of information about this.

2154
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,083
But you do want to make sure

2155
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:12,360
that you're getting
enough B6, B12, et cetera,

2156
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,480
such that you can keep
prolactin levels in check.

2157
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,900
And if you suspect that you
have a dopamine deficiency,

2158
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,830
please talk to your doctor

2159
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,930
and talk to them about
ways you might adjust

2160
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:25,200
that prolactin down and
thereby dopamine up.

2161
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,710
The other way to ensure that
dopamine levels stay high

2162
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,210
or put differently,

2163
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:32,400
that you don't quash whatever dopamine

2164
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,810
you have in your system

2165
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:36,690
is to really avoid bright
light exposure to your eyes

2166
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:38,820
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM

2167
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,050
or another way of putting this

2168
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,160
because I realize people sleep

2169
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,540
at different times, et cetera,

2170
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,090
is to avoid bright light
exposure to your eyes,

2171
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:47,670
not just blue light,
but all colors of light

2172
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:52,650
in phase three, that is 17
to 24 hours after waking up

2173
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:54,450
because that's really
when you should be asleep

2174
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:57,690
or trying to get asleep, if
you're having trouble sleeping.

2175
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,400
Work from Samer Hattar's lab,

2176
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,870
the director of the chronobiology unit

2177
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,000
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

2178
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,020
again, a previous Huberman
Lab Podcast guest,

2179
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,630
tell us that bright light exposure

2180
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:13,230
in phase three of your circadian cycle,

2181
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,570
17 to 24 hours after waking,

2182
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:18,540
can have dramatic effects
in reducing dopamine levels

2183
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,400
by way of activating a neural circuit

2184
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,407
involving something called the habenula.

2185
01:23:22,407 --> 01:23:24,300
I don't want to get into
too many details right now,

2186
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,100
but really try and keep the lights dim

2187
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,240
in the middle of the night or off,

2188
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,160
if you can do that safely.

2189
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,480
It's really going to help

2190
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,850
if you're turning on your phone brightly,

2191
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:34,800
if you are turning on bright lights,

2192
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,350
it's not just going to
negatively impact melatonin,

2193
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:39,090
the hormone that helps
you fall and stay asleep.

2194
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:43,200
It's also going to negatively
impact dopamine levels,

2195
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,470
not just that night,
but the subsequent day.

2196
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:49,050
So that more or less
summarizes our coverage

2197
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:52,680
of ways to use behavior and
supplementation and nutrition

2198
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,910
to increase dopamine

2199
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,490
and dopamine receptor efficacy and number,

2200
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,590
and to keep sufficient amounts of dopamine

2201
01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:02,850
in your system day-to-day for
motivation, mood and focus.

2202
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:04,470
And of course, keep in mind those things

2203
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,850
that can suppress dopamine,

2204
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:07,980
the bright light exposure,

2205
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:10,110
elevated prolactin, and so on.

2206
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,757
My hope is that by
understanding those tools

2207
01:24:11,757 --> 01:24:12,690
and how they work

2208
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,480
and understanding that
dopamine does certain things

2209
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,560
and not others

2210
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,370
that you can assemble a
versatile kit of behaviors

2211
01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:21,720
and other things that you can do

2212
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,820
in order to adjust your dopamine levels

2213
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:26,400
according to your particular goals.

2214
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,910
I want to just briefly
return to the fact, however,

2215
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:33,240
that all of that is
riding on that phase one,

2216
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,590
phase two background,

2217
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:38,310
meaning, it's probably going to
take less cold water exposure,

2218
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:41,190
or I should say less time
doing cold water exposure

2219
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:42,150
early in the day

2220
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,920
to get a big increase in dopamine

2221
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,630
than it would later in the day.

2222
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:48,270
Because later in the day, your
baseline levels of dopamine

2223
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:51,630
are lower and you've got
more serotonin circulating.

2224
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:54,330
That should make sense to you
now as to why that's the case.

2225
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:55,890
And does that mean

2226
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,470
that you should really modify
your protocols dramatically?

2227
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:01,260
Probably not, but you
might keep that in mind

2228
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,690
that if, for instance, you need
to be in a highly motivated,

2229
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,490
focused state in the late part of the day,

2230
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:06,570
for whatever reason,

2231
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:09,270
it might take a few or more of these tools

2232
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,490
in combination in order
to accomplish that.

2233
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:12,990
Whereas if you're somebody
who feels pretty good

2234
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:15,278
during the day, but you're
kind of lacking motivation

2235
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:16,530
and you want to increase dopamine levels

2236
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:18,270
and you don't yet need to,

2237
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:20,970
or want to resort to prescription
drugs or supplementation,

2238
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:23,310
well, then you might layer in
a couple behavioral protocols

2239
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,750
paying attention to of course,

2240
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,800
the things that you might be doing

2241
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,620
that would also potentially
suppress dopamine.

2242
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,810
So again, that kit of tools is designed

2243
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,600
for you to play with, if you choose,

2244
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,020
if it's safe for you to
apply them, then do that.

2245
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,790
Consider doing them individually,

2246
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:42,240
not trying to hit all the
tools all at once, right?

2247
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,430
I mean, why throw all those tools

2248
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:46,410
at your dopamine system at once?

2249
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:48,720
Better would be to have
those tools in your kit

2250
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,340
and be able to deploy them depending on

2251
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,450
whether or not you're on travel,

2252
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:53,910
whether or not you're
eating well or less well,

2253
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:56,100
whether or not you're
sleeping well or less well.

2254
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,360
That's highly individual

2255
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,090
and I'd like to think that in
having those tools in hand,

2256
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,520
you'll be able to adjust them
and apply them in the ways

2257
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,090
that allow you to access
the dopamine increases

2258
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:06,923
that you're after.

2259
01:26:06,923 --> 01:26:08,850
So next I'd like to
talk about epinephrine,

2260
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,740
also called adrenaline.

2261
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,840
I want to point out that epinephrine

2262
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,600
is released both in
the brain and the body.

2263
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,730
In fact, there's a barrier
between brain and body

2264
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,680
that prevents the
epinephrine that's released

2265
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,390
from your adrenal glands,

2266
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:23,370
from crossing the blood brain barrier.

2267
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,320
So your brain has a separate site

2268
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,150
called the locus coeruleus.

2269
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:29,280
This is a collection of neurons
in the back of the brain

2270
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,810
that kind of sprinkler
the rest of the brain

2271
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:31,780
with epinephrine

2272
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,040
and essentially wakes up

2273
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,300
whatever neural circuits
happen to see, or I should say,

2274
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,790
wake up any circuits
where that epinephrine

2275
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:43,950
happens to arrive, right,

2276
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:46,620
and generally increase the
excitability of those networks.

2277
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:50,040
That's why we say
epinephrine increases energy.

2278
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,690
I'm not talking about caloric energy,

2279
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,730
although that's distantly related to this,

2280
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:57,210
but really energy and the desire to move,

2281
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,890
the feeling that we can think,

2282
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:00,540
the feeling that we can be alert.

2283
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,947
In fact, if you look at somebody

2284
01:27:01,947 --> 01:27:04,320
and their eyelids are wide open,

2285
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,153
in large part,

2286
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:07,140
that's because of a lot of
adrenaline in their system.

2287
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,640
If their pupils are really big

2288
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,560
and their eyes are really wide open,

2289
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,670
in general, that means they have

2290
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:13,410
a lot of epinephrine circulating there,

2291
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,480
whereas when we're tired
and we're kind of hood-eyed

2292
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,620
and we're sort of sleepy,

2293
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,270
or our pupils are really small,

2294
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,970
in general, that's because
levels of epinephrine

2295
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,370
and also dopamine, remember
they work together,

2296
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:26,340
levels of epinephrine and
dopamine tend to be lower.

2297
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,590
This is also why when
people take any drug,

2298
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,480
like again, not recommending this,

2299
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,850
amphetamine or cocaine or any stimulant,

2300
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,380
their pupils tend to be huge.

2301
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,780
Their eyes tend to be wide open.

2302
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,760
They don't blink very often.

2303
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,300
And the opposite is true
when people take sedatives.

2304
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,680
So it all starts to make sense

2305
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,710
when you think about the
basic actions of these things.

2306
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:51,270
For many people, increasing
adrenaline or epinephrine

2307
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:52,560
might seem like a crazy idea.

2308
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,320
Most people probably associate
this molecule with stress

2309
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,910
and then would like to be less stressed.

2310
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:58,770
And we've done entire
episodes about stress,

2311
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,840
how to master stress,
how to leverage stress,

2312
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,830
how to conquer stress.

2313
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:03,690
There are a lot of great tools to do that

2314
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:05,610
that are behavioral,
supplementation-based.

2315
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:08,790
Please see the episode on
Mastering Stress for those tools,

2316
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,880
but there are people, including me,

2317
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,430
that want to increase
our levels of epinephrine

2318
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,200
at least early in the day.

2319
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,940
I'm somebody who wakes up rather slowly.

2320
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,200
In fact, right after waking up,

2321
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,090
I rarely want to bounce out of bed.

2322
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:22,710
I try and push myself to do that.

2323
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:25,260
I'm always impressed by
these chakra-willy types

2324
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:29,070
that are up at 4:30 or up at
five and already into action.

2325
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,230
I tend to be kind of thinking about

2326
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:34,710
thinking about maybe being
in action early in the day,

2327
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,920
but I try and push myself
to get into action,

2328
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,470
which itself can increase epinephrine.

2329
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:43,020
I should mention that
any physical activity,

2330
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,400
any physical activity,

2331
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,580
walking, running, weight
lifting, swimming,

2332
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:48,930
even talking for that matter

2333
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:51,240
is going to increase
levels of epinephrine.

2334
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,210
Locus coeruleus is a brain structure

2335
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:56,970
that is tightly coupled with behaviors

2336
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:58,530
in a bidirectional way.

2337
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:01,200
That is, when you are in action,

2338
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,360
you increase the amount
of epinephrine released

2339
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,230
from locus coeruleus.

2340
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:05,373
You wake up the brain.

2341
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:09,720
And conversely, when
locus coeruleus is active,

2342
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,580
the brain wakes up, so it's reciprocal.

2343
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,290
It goes both directions.

2344
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,260
So I saw a funny tweet
actually earlier today,

2345
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,310
it was something like

2346
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,280
going to the gym gives you energy,

2347
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,990
but you need energy to go to the gym.

2348
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:24,150
Sounds like a pyramid scheme to me,

2349
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,590
which made me chuckle.

2350
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:28,260
But of course overlooks the fact that,

2351
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:29,910
indeed, if you have energy,

2352
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:31,560
you are more likely to be willing

2353
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,180
to get into physical movement

2354
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,820
or cognitive movement and thinking hard

2355
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,920
or thinking a lot about something.

2356
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,210
But also it is absolutely
scientifically proven

2357
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,280
that being in action

2358
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,230
increases levels of epinephrine.

2359
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,050
This is why exercising early in the day

2360
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,690
gives you more energy for rest of day.

2361
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:53,580
You still might experience
a little bit of a crash

2362
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,630
in the afternoon,

2363
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,850
especially if you're
getting up extra early,

2364
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:59,160
or if you're drinking
caffeine too close to waking.

2365
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,360
I've talked about this before.

2366
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,270
If you drink too much
caffeine close to waking,

2367
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,770
you're going to have an afternoon crash.

2368
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:06,900
Better to push that caffeine intake out

2369
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,150
about 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

2370
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,310
I know this is really
painful for certain people,

2371
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:15,180
but caffeine does increase epinephrine.

2372
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:17,790
Caffeine does other things
to limit sleepiness.

2373
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:20,970
And by pushing it out 90 to
120 minutes after waking,

2374
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:25,470
you will avoid the afternoon
crash to a large degree.

2375
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:27,870
And if you get up and you exercise

2376
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:29,730
or even do any movement of any kind,

2377
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,850
a hundred jumping jacks or a
walk, if you can't do that,

2378
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:35,010
anything like that will increase

2379
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:37,530
the total amount of
epinephrine that you secrete

2380
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:39,060
into your bloodstream and in your brain

2381
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:42,030
and will get you more energy,

2382
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:43,800
not just in that moment,
but throughout the day.

2383
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,730
So keep that in mind.

2384
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,610
Exercise does indeed give you energy.

2385
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,990
It burns caloric energy,

2386
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:50,790
but it gives you neural energy

2387
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:53,220
by way of increasing
epinephrine transmission

2388
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,720
from locus coeruleus.

2389
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:58,440
And presumably if the
exercise is intense enough,

2390
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,510
adrenaline, epinephrine release,

2391
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:02,910
from the adrenals within
your body, as well.

2392
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:05,160
So we have exercise and we have caffeine

2393
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,230
as potent tools for increasing epinephrine

2394
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,150
and thereby, energy.

2395
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,580
Another potent tool
that's purely behavioral,

2396
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,870
but is known to work,

2397
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,850
based on excellent studies in humans.

2398
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,740
And actually my laboratory has been doing

2399
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,760
similar types of studies

2400
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,100
that are soon to be published, we hope,

2401
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,860
is so-called cyclic hyperventilation.

2402
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,320
Some of you may be familiar
with Wim Hof breathing.

2403
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,170
There's also Tummo breathing,
which is very similar,

2404
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,940
Kundalini breathing.

2405
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,470
All of those styles of breathing

2406
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,810
involve cyclic hyperventilation,

2407
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:38,220
deep inhales, and either passive
exhales or active exhales,

2408
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:40,320
but repeating, inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale,

2409
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,690
in a very deep and repetitive way.

2410
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:44,640
If you were to do that right now,

2411
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,590
doesn't matter if you do it
through your nose or mouth,

2412
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:48,900
although ideally you would do
the inhale through your nose

2413
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,860
and the exhale through your mouth,

2414
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,920
if you did that for 25 repetitions,

2415
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,010
25 inhales and exhales,
you would feel more alert.

2416
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,720
You'd also feel more warm, why?

2417
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,930
Because you increased
epinephrine, adrenaline release

2418
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:02,040
in the brain and body.

2419
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,560
It works the first time
and it works every time

2420
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,410
to increase epinephrine
and thereby energy.

2421
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:10,200
And in fact, there are protocols

2422
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,280
and great scientific studies

2423
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,530
of using cyclic hyperventilation

2424
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:16,890
for periods of minutes, if not longer,

2425
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:20,610
where for instance, you would
do 25 big inhales and exhales

2426
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,950
followed by a brief breath
hold with your lungs empty,

2427
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:25,950
then repeat 25, then brief breath hold,

2428
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:28,260
excuse me, exhale, hold your lungs empty.

2429
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:30,810
And then repeat again for
a third round, if you like.

2430
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:33,240
If you do that over and over,
you're going to be very alert.

2431
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,260
You're going to have more energy.

2432
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,093
You're going to feel like

2433
01:32:35,093 --> 01:32:36,570
you want to move around a lot more.

2434
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:38,310
In fact, you might even feel agitated.

2435
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:40,200
So people with a lot of anxiety

2436
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,180
or prone to panic attack
might want to be cautious

2437
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:45,270
in how they train and embark
on that type of breathing,

2438
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:46,830
might want to approach it
a little more carefully

2439
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,060
or avoid it altogether.

2440
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:48,990
But for most people,

2441
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,700
cyclic hyperventilation is simply going to

2442
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,700
get you more energized and
feeling like you want to move,

2443
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,440
feeling like you can think more clearly,

2444
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,150
and you'll be more wide-eyed and alert

2445
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:59,850
because you are releasing adrenaline.

2446
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,440
And the cold water exposure protocol

2447
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,430
that I talked about earlier

2448
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:04,590
and that's covered in our episode on cold

2449
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:06,660
and in the newsletter on cold.

2450
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,610
Well that, as I mentioned earlier,

2451
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:11,940
potently increases dopamine,
but also epinephrine.

2452
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,230
So that's another terrific tool,

2453
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:16,740
whether or not it's applied by
cold shower or cold immersion

2454
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:19,110
or some other thing like cryo,

2455
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:20,850
that is going to make you more alert

2456
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:23,100
because it releases adrenaline.

2457
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,560
Now we can't really say
that there are foods

2458
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,270
to increase epinephrine.

2459
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:30,780
Rather, there are foods that
include a lot of tyrosine

2460
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,700
that will increase dopamine.

2461
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:34,530
And remember, dopamine is the molecule

2462
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:37,230
from which epinephrine is synthesized.

2463
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:40,110
So we can't really point
to a particular food

2464
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:42,120
or categories of food for
increasing epinephrine.

2465
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,520
I think caffeine and things like it

2466
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,260
will increase epinephrine.

2467
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,270
There are of course prescription drugs

2468
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:50,280
that will increase epinephrine.

2469
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,113
And of course,

2470
01:33:51,113 --> 01:33:53,580
there are all sorts of
so-called beta blockers

2471
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,950
that will block the
receptors for epinephrine

2472
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:58,320
to make you feel calm for public speaking

2473
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,330
or for various heart
conditions, et cetera.

2474
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:02,280
That's really the domain of physicians

2475
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,520
and should really be worked
out with your cardiologist,

2476
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,900
with a physician et cetera.

2477
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:09,720
I think the tools of exercise

2478
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,950
and should you want very
potent increases in adrenaline,

2479
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,720
high intensity exercise,

2480
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:19,260
as well as the tools of
caffeine, cyclic hyperventilation

2481
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,820
and deliberate cold exposure,

2482
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:24,630
really combine to give
you a nice little kit,

2483
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:26,430
I would say a versatile kit,

2484
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:28,140
of ways to increase epinephrine

2485
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,840
for sake of having more
physical and mental energy.

2486
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,570
So next is the
neuromodulator acetylcholine.

2487
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,250
And as I mentioned earlier,

2488
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:38,970
acetylcholine is associated
with states of focus

2489
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:40,170
and those states of focus

2490
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:42,480
can be high energy states of focus.

2491
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,450
So the ones that are accompanied by

2492
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:47,880
high levels of dopamine and epinephrine

2493
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,980
and where we're really excited about

2494
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,960
and really lasered in on something,

2495
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:56,070
or they can be the calmer,
more relaxed states of focus

2496
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:58,860
like reading a book or practicing music

2497
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,140
or listening very carefully to somebody

2498
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:03,390
in a way that's relaxed and calm.

2499
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:04,380
And yet nonetheless,

2500
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:07,020
where we have a narrow cognitive

2501
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,170
and typically a narrow visual aperture,

2502
01:35:10,170 --> 01:35:12,900
and typically also a
narrow auditory aperture.

2503
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:15,720
That is our auditory system
and our visual system

2504
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,880
and our thinking can be very broad.

2505
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,590
It can be all over the place.

2506
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:21,600
Or it can be very narrow.

2507
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,790
And it can be very focused.

2508
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:27,000
Acetylcholine is released from
two major sites in the brain,

2509
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,550
nucleus basalis, which is in the forebrain

2510
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:32,520
and extends connections out
to many different brain areas

2511
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:36,660
to offer the opportunity to
release acetylcholine locally

2512
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,180
and more or less in a chemical way,

2513
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:42,690
highlight those particular
neurons and synapses

2514
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:45,690
for strengthening, for plasticity later.

2515
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:48,990
And it is released from sites
in the back of the brain

2516
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:51,330
in a way that can increase

2517
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:54,930
the so-called fidelity
of information coming in

2518
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:57,180
through our eyes, our
ears, our nose, et cetera.

2519
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,260
What do I mean by fidelity?

2520
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,970
Well, we are constantly being bombarded

2521
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:03,420
with sensory information through
all of our various senses

2522
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:05,760
and acetylcholine released from this area

2523
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,930
in the back of the brain,

2524
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:10,860
has the ability to increase
the extent to which

2525
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:12,480
say, visual information

2526
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,330
or just visual and auditory information

2527
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:17,340
would make it through to our consciousness

2528
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,680
whereas all the other types
of sensory information

2529
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,710
that are coming in are filtered out.

2530
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,920
So your brain, because it's
taking in all this information

2531
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,840
needs to decide what to pay attention to.

2532
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,790
And in this way, we can
say that acetylcholine

2533
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:32,760
has a lot to do, not just
with "focus", in air quotes,

2534
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,380
but literally attention,

2535
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,460
which neural signals become
relevant to our consciousness.

2536
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,080
There's a whole discussion to be had there

2537
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,460
and we don't have time for that.

2538
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,860
Rather, I'd like to focus
on what are the tools

2539
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,090
that one can use

2540
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:48,600
to maintain healthy
baselines of acetylcholine

2541
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,560
and increase acetylcholine
for sake of learning

2542
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,560
any type of information,
physical, cognitive, or otherwise.

2543
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,360
Now it turns out there
have been a lot of studies,

2544
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,130
including many quality
peer reviewed studies

2545
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:00,210
carried out in humans,

2546
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:01,680
looking at what happens

2547
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:05,400
when you increase acetylcholine
levels in the brain

2548
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,010
and you accompany that
with the attempt to learn.

2549
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:10,440
And what you find almost always

2550
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:13,680
is that people experience increased focus,

2551
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:16,710
that when measured the neuronal responses

2552
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:18,270
become more specific,

2553
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:20,280
so less broad scale activity in the brain

2554
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:23,190
and more specific neural circuit activity

2555
01:37:23,190 --> 01:37:27,540
and that this triggers immediate
and long-lasting changes

2556
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:28,950
in the way those circuits work,

2557
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:31,230
even when acetylcholine
is not being deployed,

2558
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:34,380
so-called neuroplasticity,
the circuits literally change.

2559
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,370
So this is great.

2560
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:37,770
The work of Michael Silver at Berkeley,

2561
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:40,380
the work of Mike Merzenich at UCSF,

2562
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,390
the work of Michael Kilgard down in Texas,

2563
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,470
all of those laboratories

2564
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:44,880
see this again and again, and again.

2565
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,550
Increase acetylcholine
before and during learning.

2566
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:49,500
And there's a much higher probability

2567
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,827
that the learning will quote, unquote,

2568
01:37:50,827 --> 01:37:53,130
"sink in", that the
information will be retained

2569
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:55,410
because those neural circuits change.

2570
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:59,100
Now ways to increase
acetylcholine in a potent way

2571
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:03,480
include again, nutrition
and supplementation.

2572
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:07,020
It is important to have
baseline levels of acetylcholine

2573
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,670
be sufficiently high, as well.

2574
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,650
And for that really the ideal situation

2575
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:13,440
is to regularly ingest
foods that provide enough

2576
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,410
of the precursors for
acetylcholine to be made.

2577
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:18,930
If you go online and
you were to do a search

2578
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,900
of which foods contain a lot of choline,

2579
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:25,230
which is related to the
synthesis of acetylcholine,

2580
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,210
you would get some
interesting information back.

2581
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,160
For instance, beef liver

2582
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,800
is the most potent source of choline.

2583
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,620
I know nowadays there's kind
of a growing micro trend

2584
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,420
if you will, of ingesting beef liver,

2585
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:38,370
even raw liver, which to be honest,

2586
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,890
the thought of ingesting
raw liver of any kind

2587
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:42,420
activates my area postrema,

2588
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:44,640
which is the area of the
brain that triggers nausea.

2589
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,260
In fact, I'm starting to salivate a bit,

2590
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:47,093
not because I'm hungry,

2591
01:38:47,093 --> 01:38:50,010
but I think the whole
concept makes me ill.

2592
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:51,820
Nonetheless, cooked liver

2593
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,600
or raw liver for that matter,

2594
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,960
or liver of any kind seems
to contain a lot of choline.

2595
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,940
I realize most people,

2596
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,250
most people are not
going to be running out

2597
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,830
and ingesting large amounts of beef liver.

2598
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:06,570
Eggs contain a lot of choline.

2599
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:07,590
Beef contains choline.

2600
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:08,760
Soybeans contain choline.

2601
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,310
So there are vegan or non-meat sources,

2602
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,890
chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans,

2603
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:15,897
these sorts of things
contain a lot of choline

2604
01:39:15,897 --> 01:39:17,850
and there are other vegetables
that contain choline.

2605
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:20,220
So depending on your dietary
preferences and needs,

2606
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,340
you can select certain foods to ingest,

2607
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,780
to get enough choline to synthesize

2608
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:27,453
enough baseline acetyl choline.

2609
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,940
In the realm of supplementation,

2610
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,890
there are some excellent tools

2611
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:33,990
for increasing acetylcholine

2612
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:35,730
in the acute short-term,

2613
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:38,610
meaning over the course
of about 30 minutes

2614
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:41,010
out to about two hours
or maybe even four hours.

2615
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:44,070
And the number of different
molecules that can do that,

2616
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:45,660
that are available without a prescription,

2617
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,360
at least in the US, is pretty vast.

2618
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,120
The most common of those
molecules is actually nicotine.

2619
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,550
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

2620
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:55,830
are abundant throughout
the body and brain.

2621
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:57,810
They're in various brain circuits.

2622
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:01,230
They are on muscle and yes,

2623
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:03,750
smoking nicotine either
by vaping or cigarette

2624
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:07,740
will activate those nicotinic receptors.

2625
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:10,230
But of course, smoking
is a terrible thing.

2626
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:12,750
It will also activate
things like lung cancer.

2627
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,190
So I definitely don't recommend that.

2628
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:17,040
It also activates addiction
because of the ways

2629
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,100
that it triggers activation
of the dopamine circuit.

2630
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:24,120
So I think that triggering activation

2631
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,270
of acetylcholine-related
pathways by ingesting nicotine

2632
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:31,320
by way of inhalants is
generally a bad idea.

2633
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,770
However, some people will chew Nicorette

2634
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:37,800
or other nicotine type gums.

2635
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,633
I've never done that,

2636
01:40:38,633 --> 01:40:40,530
but I have friends who
actually rely on that.

2637
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,780
These are typically former smokers

2638
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,190
that are trying not to smoke,

2639
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:47,490
but still want to get some
of the focus enhancement

2640
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:49,380
that they experience from nicotine.

2641
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,330
Some people are very
sensitive to nicotine,

2642
01:40:51,330 --> 01:40:52,320
and this is important.

2643
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,990
Some people are very sensitive
to ingested nicotine.

2644
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:58,350
So nowadays there are
nicotine-dipped toothpicks,

2645
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,760
there of course, is nicotine gum

2646
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:00,990
and other sources of nicotine.

2647
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:02,760
Some people can take that and feel fine.

2648
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,760
Some people take it and
feel absolutely terrible.

2649
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,760
I confess, I've never
actually tried nicotine

2650
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,060
in any of those forms so I
don't know how they work for me,

2651
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,520
but some people do use them
as cognitive enhancers.

2652
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,910
In fact, I know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist,

2653
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:19,590
who's quite well known in our field

2654
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:21,600
for chewing Nicorette all day long.

2655
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,700
He insists that it really
helps him with his focus

2656
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:25,920
and he is exceedingly
smart and productive,

2657
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,080
although I'm sure there
are other reasons for that.

2658
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,140
Supplements that I have used and do use

2659
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:33,450
for increasing acetylcholine

2660
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:38,010
are things like Alpha GPC or Huperzinene.

2661
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,810
Alpha GPC

2662
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:42,360
is in the choline pathway,

2663
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,030
such that more
acetylcholine is synthesized

2664
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:46,170
after you ingest it.

2665
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:48,870
That's the general logic or
framework of how it works.

2666
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:52,440
Whereas Huperzinene is mainly
in the enzymatic pathway.

2667
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,740
It tends to adjust how much
acetylcholine is broken down

2668
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:59,640
and lead to net increases
in acetylcholine.

2669
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:02,730
I will often take 300
milligrams of Alpha GPC

2670
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:06,420
prior to workouts or prior
to cognitive work bouts.

2671
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:09,450
But when I say often, I
tend to do this anywhere

2672
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:13,530
from three to four times a
week, typically not every day.

2673
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:14,670
Although there are people

2674
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:15,630
including people who are trying

2675
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:17,850
to offset age-related cognitive decline,

2676
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:20,730
that will take 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC

2677
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:22,680
three times a day, every day,

2678
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,660
which closely mimic some of the studies

2679
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:25,890
that have been done on humans,

2680
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:28,800
looking at offsetting
age-related cognitive decline,

2681
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,470
using things like Alpha GPC.

2682
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:34,260
I should point out that there
have been a few studies,

2683
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,640
a few, not many,

2684
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,490
but these studies emphasize that people

2685
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:41,520
who take a lot of Alpha
GPC chronically over time

2686
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,070
may be at increased risk for stroke.

2687
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:46,410
I think the data are still out on that

2688
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,000
and we need more data.

2689
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,680
But for me, in terms of thinking

2690
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,420
about the risk benefit profiles,

2691
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:53,910
taking 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC,

2692
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:56,040
most certainly does increase
my ability to focus.

2693
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:56,873
I've noticed that.

2694
01:42:56,873 --> 01:42:58,587
I tend to take it alongside caffeine

2695
01:42:58,587 --> 01:43:00,150
and phenylethylamine.

2696
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:01,800
So I take that in combination

2697
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:03,480
either before workouts or workbouts,

2698
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,830
really sharpens my focus.

2699
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:07,470
And again, I'm doing that three,
maybe four times per week.

2700
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:10,020
And I'm careful to do that
in the early part of the day

2701
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,300
so that it does not disrupt my sleep.

2702
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,890
Although I have taken Alpha GPC

2703
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:15,210
in the second half of the day,

2704
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:17,340
and I had no trouble sleeping at all.

2705
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:20,820
I don't know what the exact
half life is of the given form

2706
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,500
that's typically in supplementation.

2707
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,540
It's actually hard to
get that information.

2708
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,960
But typically the focus
effects wear off after

2709
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,360
about two, maybe four hours maximum.

2710
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:31,680
Now one thing that I don't think

2711
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,180
has ever been discussed before,

2712
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,830
certainly not on this podcast

2713
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:38,280
is that if you take Alpha GPC,

2714
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,600
even semi-regularly,

2715
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,570
you may notice that a particular feature

2716
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:45,690
of your blood work will
increase and that's TMAO,

2717
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,520
which is sometimes associated

2718
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,250
with increased cardiovascular risk.

2719
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:53,910
This may, again, may relate
to some of the potential risk

2720
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:58,020
of very high levels of Alpha
GPC ingestion over many years,

2721
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,730
increasing stroke risk.

2722
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,132
Again, those studies looked at people

2723
01:44:01,132 --> 01:44:03,060
who've been taking it for up to a decade,

2724
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:04,680
but in any case,

2725
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:07,770
one way to prevent the increase in TMAO,

2726
01:44:07,770 --> 01:44:10,440
if you're taking Alpha GPC at all

2727
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,320
is to take 600 milligrams of garlic

2728
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:15,870
because it contains
something called allicin.

2729
01:44:15,870 --> 01:44:18,360
This was a trick that was handed off to me

2730
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,830
by Dr. Kyle Gillette,

2731
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:21,990
who again, was a guest on
this podcast some time ago,

2732
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:23,880
talking about hormones and hormone health.

2733
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,240
Turns out that ingestion of
600 milligrams of allicin

2734
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:30,330
alongside or even just
same day as Alpha GPC

2735
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:33,060
can really clamp those TMAO levels

2736
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,520
that would otherwise increase
if you're taking Alpha GPC.

2737
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,170
And indeed I've done the blood work

2738
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:38,970
and that turns out to be the case.

2739
01:44:38,970 --> 01:44:40,320
I saw a spike in TMAO.

2740
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:43,230
I started taking 600 milligrams of garlic

2741
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,240
and those TMAO levels came down.

2742
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,160
And last as it relates to acetylcholine,

2743
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,110
but certainly not least,

2744
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,750
just as acetylcholine can increase focus,

2745
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:54,480
focus can increase acetylcholine.

2746
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,420
I talked a lot about this
in the episode on focus,

2747
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:58,860
but there are behavioral tools

2748
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,570
that you can use to enhance focus.

2749
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:03,630
Things like staring at a
particular visual target

2750
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,040
at the same distance at

2751
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,570
which you're going to perform some work

2752
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:09,510
and doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,

2753
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:11,910
narrowing in a very deliberate
way, your visual field,

2754
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:14,790
and then moving into a focused work about.

2755
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:19,790
That behavioral practice of
narrowing your visual aperture

2756
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:22,440
will increase the amount of
acetylcholine transmission

2757
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,180
in particular neural circuits

2758
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:25,980
that will then make it easier to focus.

2759
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:26,820
How do we know that?

2760
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,160
Well, I covered in that episode,

2761
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,660
some of the peer reviewed studies

2762
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,890
that relate to protocols

2763
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:33,900
that are now actively being deployed

2764
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,360
in schools in China and elsewhere,

2765
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,110
where kids are doing deliberate
visual focus exercises

2766
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:41,940
in order to increase their mental focus.

2767
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,680
And while they're not doing microdialysis

2768
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,170
or brain imaging on
those kids in real time,

2769
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:49,950
the cognitive effects and
indeed the performance effects

2770
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:52,350
in terms of academic ability and output

2771
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:53,520
are pretty impressive.

2772
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,740
So acetylcholine increases focus.

2773
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:58,200
We talked about some dietary

2774
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,180
and some supplementation-based ways

2775
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:02,070
to improve acetylcholine,

2776
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:04,050
or I should say increase acetylcholine.

2777
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:07,020
And that does in fact lead to increases

2778
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,910
in one's ability to focus.

2779
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,280
This is why a lot of
the prescription drugs

2780
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,113
for the treatment

2781
01:46:12,113 --> 01:46:14,430
of Alzheimer's age-related
cognitive decline

2782
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,870
and indeed, even some of the drugs

2783
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:19,200
that tap into treatments for ADHD

2784
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,600
also involve the acetylcholine system.

2785
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,080
So there's nothing
surprising or heretical here,

2786
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,400
but it is important to point out

2787
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,590
that your behavioral ability to focus

2788
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:30,990
is also related to your ability to access

2789
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:32,520
and deploy acetylcholine.

2790
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:37,080
So never do we want purely
pharmacologic treatments

2791
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:40,230
to be the only way that
people are increasing

2792
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:41,430
a given neuromodulator.

2793
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:43,890
I always say behaviors first,

2794
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:45,450
then nutrition,

2795
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,620
then supplementation.

2796
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,270
And then if there's a need,

2797
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,880
certainly a clinical need,
then prescription drugs,

2798
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,820
et cetera, of course
administered through a physician.

2799
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,710
So let's discuss serotonin.

2800
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:57,240
Serotonin, as I mentioned earlier,

2801
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:01,320
is associated with brain and
body states of well-being,

2802
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,060
of comfort, of satiety,

2803
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:04,830
and therefore should come as no surprise

2804
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:06,600
that a lot of the
prescription drug treatments

2805
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,040
for things like depression

2806
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,560
involve increasing levels of serotonin

2807
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,360
in the brain and body.

2808
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,370
That said, anytime you talk about

2809
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,500
prescription drugs for serotonin,

2810
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,090
we also want to acknowledge that

2811
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:20,010
there are often side effects associated

2812
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:21,270
with increasing serotonin,

2813
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:23,820
in particular, if serotonin
levels go too high,

2814
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,610
that is if the dosages of
those treatments go too high,

2815
01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:28,320
people will, for instance,

2816
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,600
feel reduced appetite, reduced libido,

2817
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,520
increased lethargy, et cetera.

2818
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,100
And there's a so-called
serotonergic syndrome.

2819
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,860
All of that can and should be considered

2820
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,290
with a well-trained physician,

2821
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,030
so because they're prescription drugs,

2822
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,740
controlling the dosage,

2823
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:45,660
deciding what dosage to take,

2824
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:48,570
deciding which SSRI to take

2825
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,220
and whether or not to
come off those drugs,

2826
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:51,240
how to come off those drugs.

2827
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,770
Again, all of that should be handled

2828
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:55,233
with a licensed physician.

2829
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:59,457
That said, there are behavioral
tools, nutritional tools,

2830
01:47:59,457 --> 01:48:01,110
and supplementation tools

2831
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:03,150
that can tap into the serotonin system,

2832
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:04,770
not to the same degree in potency,

2833
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,740
but nonetheless, in ways
that can still impact

2834
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:11,190
our feelings of well-being
in positive ways.

2835
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:14,190
So let's focus first
on the behavioral tools

2836
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:16,680
and some of these might make
people chuckle a little bit,

2837
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,230
but I want to point out
that a lot of these tools

2838
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:20,370
are quite potent.

2839
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:24,090
In fact, they are power tools
for modulating serotonin.

2840
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:27,060
And we know that based on
human neuro imaging studies,

2841
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:30,270
human and animal microdialysis studies

2842
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,670
and other studies that
really have evaluated

2843
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,380
circulating levels of serotonin

2844
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:37,260
and the particular brain
circuits that release serotonin

2845
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,150
when people do certain things.

2846
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,410
What sorts of things?

2847
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:43,380
Well, for instance, physical contact,

2848
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:44,580
in particular with loved ones,

2849
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,840
this can be romantic love.

2850
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:49,620
This can be children, so your own children

2851
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:53,430
or your spouse, even if
it's not sexual contact,

2852
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,860
friend to friend contact,

2853
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:58,320
even friend to animal contact, you know,

2854
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,420
as a former dog owner,

2855
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,620
I hope to have another dog soon

2856
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:03,390
'cause unfortunately Costello passed away,

2857
01:49:03,390 --> 01:49:04,740
but there is something really comforting

2858
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,720
and wonderful about petting your dog.

2859
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:10,620
And certainly, given that many
of the studies on serotonin

2860
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:14,310
and these other neuromodulators
were done on animal models,

2861
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:17,670
we also know that serotonin
is being evoked in the dog

2862
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:19,050
and of course in the child

2863
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:20,880
and in the significant other, et cetera.

2864
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,490
So things like holding
hands, believe it or not,

2865
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:26,280
hugs, cuddling, et cetera,

2866
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,410
can increase serotonin transmission

2867
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:30,270
and they make people feel good.

2868
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:32,220
This shouldn't really come as a surprise.

2869
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:33,450
There's also gratitude.

2870
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:35,670
And we did an entire
episode about gratitude.

2871
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:38,130
There's a lot of
misunderstanding about gratitude.

2872
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:40,350
Oftentimes when people
hear gratitude, they think,

2873
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:42,090
oh, gratitude, this is just being thankful

2874
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:44,940
for what you have and it's
kind of a weak sauce effect,

2875
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,560
meaning, you know, it's kind of like,

2876
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,810
maybe a little serotonin goes up

2877
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:49,643
or maybe there's a little bit

2878
01:49:49,643 --> 01:49:51,930
of increased feelings of well-being.

2879
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:53,460
Nothing could be further from the truth.

2880
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:55,170
It turns out, first of all,

2881
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:57,990
that receiving not giving gratitude

2882
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:59,640
is what has the most potent effects

2883
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,790
on increasing serotonin and
activity of the brain circuits

2884
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:03,930
that involve serotonin

2885
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:06,750
and that lead to increases
in feelings of well-being.

2886
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:08,160
So this is interesting.

2887
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:12,330
Receiving much more than giving gratitude

2888
01:50:12,330 --> 01:50:14,820
is what activates those
serotonergic pathways.

2889
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:16,860
So the takeaway from that is

2890
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,780
both give and receive gratitude

2891
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:20,730
and of course, do it in an authentic way.

2892
01:50:20,730 --> 01:50:21,900
The other thing about gratitude

2893
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:24,180
that's somewhat counterintuitive is that

2894
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:27,270
observing others giving
and receiving gratitude

2895
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:30,510
is immensely powerful
for evoking serotonin

2896
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:33,630
and the activity of
serotonergic circuits in you,

2897
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,500
the observer.

2898
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,960
So receiving and observing gratitude

2899
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,350
turns out to be the most potent
way to increase serotonin

2900
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:41,700
in the brain and body.

2901
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,440
And these again are dramatic effects

2902
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,880
that are quite long-lasting

2903
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,290
and not the sorts of effects

2904
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:47,520
that are going to lead to side effects,

2905
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,890
at least there's no reason
to think they would.

2906
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,770
Now what about nutritional approaches

2907
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:54,120
to increasing serotonin?

2908
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:57,630
Well, just as we have tyrosine
as an amino acid precursor

2909
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:59,853
upstream of dopamine synthesis,

2910
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:04,380
we have the amino acid tryptophan,

2911
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:07,410
which is upstream of serotonin synthesis.

2912
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:09,600
And one simply has to go online

2913
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,030
and put in tryptophan containing foods

2914
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:13,770
and you will discover that
there are a lot of foods

2915
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:15,390
that are enriched in tryptophan

2916
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:18,990
that can lead to net increases
in the amount of serotonin

2917
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:20,610
available in the brain and body.

2918
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:23,070
The most kind of famous
or infamous of these

2919
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:24,600
is white meat turkey,

2920
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,120
the so-called tryptophan effect
where people get very sleepy

2921
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,097
after eating white meat turkey.

2922
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:31,440
And it is indeed highly
enriched in tryptophan

2923
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,690
although typically the getting
sleepy after eating turkey

2924
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:36,780
is most often associated
with the Thanksgiving meal

2925
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,520
and the Thanksgiving
meal, at least in the US,

2926
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,920
is often associated with
people vastly overeating.

2927
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,240
And so I do want to point out

2928
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,250
that if you fill your gut with food,

2929
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:46,140
no matter what that food is,

2930
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,940
there's going to be a
diversion of blood to your gut

2931
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:49,110
that's going to make you feel sleepy

2932
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:50,400
because there's a diversion of blood

2933
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,870
away from other tissues.

2934
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:53,760
So if you eat a lot, you're
going to get sleepy, period,

2935
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,220
whether or not you eat turkey
or some other substance.

2936
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:57,960
Nonetheless, there are a number of foods

2937
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,240
that contain a lot of tryptophan

2938
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,790
and that some people will leverage

2939
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:05,520
in order to try and
increase the total amount

2940
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,560
of circulating serotonin available to them

2941
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,530
in order to have a modest increase

2942
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:12,240
in overall mood and well-being.

2943
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:13,560
So what are some of these foods?

2944
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,770
These are things like milk,
in particular, whole milk,

2945
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:18,270
so full fat milk.

2946
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:20,700
I know a number of people
choose not to drink milk

2947
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,560
'cause they're lactose intolerant.

2948
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,510
I'm raising my hand 'cause
I'm one such person,

2949
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:28,290
although when I was a
kid, I did enjoy milk.

2950
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:29,730
Canned tuna.

2951
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:32,130
Turkey, as we mentioned
before, high in tryptophan.

2952
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:36,000
Oats, I am a consumer of oatmeal
so that resonates with me.

2953
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,040
Cheese and here I read,

2954
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,840
although not as high in tryptophan as meat

2955
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:42,150
and other dairy sources,

2956
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,530
certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses

2957
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:45,210
can be rich in tryptophan.

2958
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:48,270
Certain nuts and seeds, certain breads.

2959
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:50,130
Chocolate, I know a number of people

2960
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:51,480
will be relieved to hear that.

2961
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:53,550
I know chocolate lovers are always looking

2962
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:55,050
for an excuse to eat chocolate.

2963
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:56,700
I confess I've never
really liked chocolate,

2964
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:57,840
except dare I say,

2965
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,390
I like the smooth 100% percent chocolates.

2966
01:53:00,390 --> 01:53:02,050
I know many people gag when
they hear a hundred percent,

2967
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:03,540
but I actually really like them.

2968
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:06,060
And some fruits can be highly
enriched in tryptophan,

2969
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:09,390
things like bananas and apples
and things of that sort,

2970
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,360
although not nearly to
the degree of things

2971
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,850
like turkey, canned tuna and milk.

2972
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:17,670
I'm sure there are other
excellent sources of tryptophan

2973
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:20,280
from the diet, including vegan sources

2974
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,140
so please peruse the internet to try

2975
01:53:22,140 --> 01:53:23,790
and find the sources that are compatible

2976
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:25,800
with your nutritional program,

2977
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,740
if indeed your goal is
to increase tryptophan.

2978
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:31,080
Now there are supplements
that can increase tryptophan

2979
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,600
and can do so quite potently.

2980
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,170
One of the ones that has
received increasing attention

2981
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:40,410
as of lately is cissus quadrangularis,

2982
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:41,940
complicated name,

2983
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:45,720
when taken in dosages of
about 300 to 600 milligrams

2984
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:49,590
can pretty dramatically
increase serotonin levels.

2985
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:53,790
In fact, anywhere from
30% to 39% increases

2986
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:55,680
in circulating serotonin.

2987
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:57,810
That's a big increase

2988
01:53:57,810 --> 01:53:59,820
and I can provide a link to that study.

2989
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,760
The study was focused,
not so much on serotonin,

2990
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:06,120
but was focused mainly
on treatment of obesity

2991
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:07,920
and appetite and weight loss.

2992
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:11,370
And it should come as no
surprise that serotonin,

2993
01:54:11,370 --> 01:54:15,090
if increased, might lead
to decreases in appetite.

2994
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:16,233
A cautionary note,

2995
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:20,073
cissus quadrangularis
may need to be cycled.

2996
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,410
How quickly to cycle it,

2997
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:25,170
meaning do you do two
weeks on, two weeks off?

2998
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:27,600
Whether or not you need
to do more rapid cycling

2999
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:30,480
like two days on, two days
off, is a matter of debate.

3000
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:33,210
There are not a lot of
data on this just yet.

3001
01:54:33,210 --> 01:54:35,280
There are a lot of opinions
about this on the internet,

3002
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,920
but again, not a lot of
quality peer review data.

3003
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,290
Nonetheless cissus
quadrangularis has been shown

3004
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,840
to increase serotonin in humans

3005
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,600
and for people that are
seeking to increase serotonin

3006
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:46,920
maybe in particular,

3007
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:49,230
for sake of appetite and weight control,

3008
01:54:49,230 --> 01:54:51,120
that might be a useful compound.

3009
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:53,520
I know many people also take 5-HTP,

3010
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,070
one of the precursors to serotonin

3011
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:59,010
in dosages of anywhere
from 300 to 500 milligrams.

3012
01:54:59,010 --> 01:55:02,280
Typically people are doing
this in anticipation of sleep,

3013
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,440
meaning in the final hour of wakefulness

3014
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,240
before going to sleep.

3015
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:09,000
I myself have tried 5-HTP prior to sleep

3016
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,550
and all I can tell you is
that it led to very deep sleep

3017
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:12,780
for about one to three hours.

3018
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:15,120
And then I woke up and I
could not fall back asleep.

3019
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,920
I ran that experiment twice

3020
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:19,740
before I decided to abandon
5-HTP as a sleep aid.

3021
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:22,740
And that's why I've never
put it into our sleep kit

3022
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:24,900
or at least my sleep kit.

3023
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:26,760
And when I refer to the sleep kit,

3024
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,770
that's something you can
find at HubermanLab.com.

3025
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:30,180
This is zero cost resource

3026
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:32,040
where you can see behavioral tools

3027
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,590
and also supplementation tools

3028
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:36,540
that can improve the transition time

3029
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:38,070
into and the depth of sleep.

3030
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:41,610
And none of those rely
on 5-HTP supplementation.

3031
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:42,443
That said,

3032
01:55:42,443 --> 01:55:45,840
I know a number of people
use 5-HTP supplementation

3033
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,220
outside of sleep,

3034
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:48,510
or I should say during the daytime

3035
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:50,040
to try and increase serotonin

3036
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,980
and it will indeed increase
circulating serotonin.

3037
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,560
But again, people vary
in their sensitivity

3038
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,090
to these sorts of things.

3039
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:58,263
Some people might find for instance,

3040
01:55:58,263 --> 01:56:01,800
that 300 milligrams of
5-HTP is just far too much.

3041
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,860
It blunts their appetite,
might even reduce libido.

3042
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:06,810
There aren't a lot of very
well controlled studies

3043
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:07,710
looking at this

3044
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:10,260
and so it has to be figured
out on an individual basis,

3045
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,420
if you decide to approach it at all.

3046
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,890
Now one molecule that I've found

3047
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:16,200
to be particularly interesting and useful

3048
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,240
and this is one that I
haven't talked about yet

3049
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:19,350
on this podcast

3050
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:23,130
is inositol, in particular myo-inositol.

3051
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:27,210
Myo-inositol can have the
effect of increasing serotonin

3052
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:29,820
and other neurochemicals,

3053
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,620
but primarily at least in terms

3054
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:34,650
of the neuromodulators
discussed today, serotonin.

3055
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:38,040
I've been taking 900
milligrams of myo-inositol

3056
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,420
every third night or so

3057
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:41,610
as a test of its ability to improve sleep.

3058
01:56:41,610 --> 01:56:42,930
And I have to say,

3059
01:56:42,930 --> 01:56:46,170
the depth and quality of
sleep that I've been obtaining

3060
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:49,290
on myo-inositol is pretty remarkable.

3061
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:50,970
In fact, I've used it alone

3062
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:52,110
and in combination

3063
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:55,410
with the magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit

3064
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:57,810
that I've talked about and
that's included in that,

3065
01:56:57,810 --> 01:56:59,790
again, zero cost kit that's available

3066
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,380
as a PDF on our website.

3067
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:02,910
So myo-inositol is known

3068
01:57:02,910 --> 01:57:05,430
to increase circulating
levels of serotonin.

3069
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:08,070
It has been explored extensively

3070
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:10,230
in both animal models and in humans

3071
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:13,350
for its daytime use for treating anxiety.

3072
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:15,420
It does seem to reduce anxiety.

3073
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,310
And for all sorts of things.

3074
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:19,500
It's been explored for bipolar disorder.

3075
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,920
We're going to do an episode
about bipolar disorder coming up.

3076
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,140
It's been explored for
the treatment of migraine.

3077
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:27,030
It's been explored for ADHD.

3078
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:29,130
It's been explored for a huge number

3079
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:31,350
of different conditions of brain and body.

3080
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:33,390
Again, I've been using the 900 milligrams

3081
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:37,080
of myo-inositol in the 30
to 60 minutes before sleep

3082
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,160
to improve my sleep

3083
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:40,200
and it has been doing
that very dramatically,

3084
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,600
especially when I take it alongside

3085
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:45,330
the rest of those sleep kit supplements.

3086
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:47,070
A quick note about myo-inositol

3087
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:49,410
for sake of increasing serotonin.

3088
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:52,080
if you look at the human
studies on myo-inositol

3089
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,100
that are out there

3090
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:55,440
and in particular focus
on the human studies,

3091
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,140
what you'll find is that the
dosages that are often used

3092
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,340
are tremendously high,

3093
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:00,720
things like five grams,

3094
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:03,570
eight grams, 18 grams of myo-inositol

3095
01:58:03,570 --> 01:58:05,340
taken throughout the day.

3096
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,960
I don't know how people stomach that.

3097
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,120
And in fact, many people
drop out of those studies

3098
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,893
because of gastric discomfort.

3099
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:14,490
And yet I also wonder
how people tolerate it

3100
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:16,170
because it has somewhat
of a sedative effect

3101
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:18,570
and this kind of anti-anxiety effect.

3102
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:20,310
And I can't even imagine

3103
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:22,470
given my experience with 900 milligrams,

3104
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:25,290
what one would experience taking multiple

3105
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:27,570
or many more grams per day.

3106
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:30,480
So I certainly am not encouraging that.

3107
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,880
And the only reason I mention myo-inositol

3108
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,580
is that it has a known effect
of increasing serotonin.

3109
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:38,100
At least in my experience,

3110
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:40,410
it does not lead to this
falling deeply asleep

3111
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:41,430
and waking back up.

3112
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:42,450
Actually to the contrary,

3113
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:44,430
if I wake up in the middle of
the night to use the bathroom,

3114
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:45,540
or I wake up at the middle of the night,

3115
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:47,040
for whatever other reason,

3116
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,800
I find it far easier to fall back asleep

3117
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:53,970
if I've taken 900 milligrams
myo-inositol prior to sleep.

3118
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:57,000
So for me, it's proving to
be a quite useful compound.

3119
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,750
I'm not aware of having any
serotonergic deficiency overall.

3120
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:02,580
I don't consider myself depressed.

3121
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:05,580
And of course I should
mention that no supplement

3122
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:08,250
either added or withdrawn
from your protocol

3123
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:11,340
should ever be used as
a direct replacement

3124
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,660
for prescription drug treatments

3125
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:13,493
that your physician has given you.

3126
01:59:13,493 --> 01:59:15,030
You should always talk to your physician

3127
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:18,810
anytime you remove or add
something to your drug protocol

3128
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:20,730
or prescription protocol, of course.

3129
01:59:20,730 --> 01:59:22,830
So we've got behavioral protocols

3130
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:25,800
that as silly as it feels to say,

3131
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,870
have been shown to potently
increase serotonin,

3132
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:29,640
things like physical contact, cuddling,

3133
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:32,910
holding hands with people that
you love, of course, right?

3134
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:35,430
I think if they were
people that you despise,

3135
01:59:35,430 --> 01:59:38,430
it would have the opposite
effect for obvious reasons.

3136
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:42,150
But also receiving gratitude
and observing gratitude,

3137
01:59:42,150 --> 01:59:44,280
very potent increases in serotonin

3138
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:47,220
and things like cissus quadrangularis,

3139
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:50,100
things like 5-HGP may
have their uses, right?

3140
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:53,250
They're very potent at
increasing serotonin,

3141
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:56,190
but they do seem to have
the need to cycle them

3142
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:57,600
and they are nuanced.

3143
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:58,890
Some people respond well to them,

3144
01:59:58,890 --> 02:00:00,870
others like myself don't

3145
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:03,870
and of course, always be
on the lookout for dramatic

3146
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:05,790
or even subtle decreases in appetite

3147
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:08,310
or libido or things
that you might not want

3148
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:10,110
if you are going to be tinkering

3149
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:13,290
with your serotonergic
levels and pathways.

3150
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,240
And then myo-inositol actually

3151
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:17,700
is proving to be quite useful to me

3152
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,200
and whether or not that's

3153
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,120
because of its effects on serotonin

3154
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:23,580
or through some of its other effects on

3155
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:24,780
maybe reducing anxiety,

3156
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:25,860
which certainly I experience

3157
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:26,693
if I wake up in the middle of the night,

3158
02:00:26,693 --> 02:00:28,380
I don't like waking up in
the middle of the night,

3159
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:29,213
but on myo-inositol,

3160
02:00:29,213 --> 02:00:31,380
I sort of seem to not
really care that I woke up

3161
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:32,520
and I fall right back asleep.

3162
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,680
So the direct source
of the positive effects

3163
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,720
that I'm getting aren't
clear, but nonetheless,

3164
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,150
I thought I'd pass it
along as a useful tool

3165
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:40,530
because it is out there

3166
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:42,720
and it is available over the counter

3167
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:45,210
and provided you're taking
the appropriate safety steps

3168
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:47,850
in considering whether
or not to use it or not,

3169
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:49,920
I think it might be a useful tool.

3170
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,753
And of course,

3171
02:00:50,753 --> 02:00:53,580
as with all the other
neuromodulators we discussed,

3172
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:56,790
you have both a baseline of serotonin

3173
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:58,410
and the ability to give

3174
02:00:58,410 --> 02:01:00,660
or provide yourself peaks of serotonin

3175
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:02,220
through these various protocols.

3176
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:05,640
The dietary interventions of
the sort that I mentioned,

3177
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,490
meaning eating foods that
are enriched in tryptophan,

3178
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:09,690
those are mainly going to

3179
02:01:09,690 --> 02:01:12,840
adjust your baseline levels of tryptophan.

3180
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,240
For instance, if you
really want to be sleepy,

3181
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,160
sure you could eat some white meat turkey

3182
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:20,190
in hopes that that tryptophan
will convert to serotonin

3183
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:21,840
and make you sleepy, et cetera.

3184
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,673
But in general,

3185
02:01:22,673 --> 02:01:24,960
those are going to be
pretty long-lasting effects,

3186
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,450
especially given the fact that not all

3187
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:28,230
of the tryptophan you will ingest

3188
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:31,590
is going to be converted
into serotonin in your brain.

3189
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:32,790
It's going to have other effects

3190
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:35,040
on other tissues and organs of your body.

3191
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,470
Nonetheless, if you want
to increase serotonin,

3192
02:01:37,470 --> 02:01:40,320
providing the appropriate baseline context

3193
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:41,520
is going to be useful.

3194
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,290
And again, this is a general theme

3195
02:01:43,290 --> 02:01:45,540
of all four of these neuromodulators,

3196
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:48,390
dopamine, epinephrine,
acetylcholine and serotonin.

3197
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:50,040
You want to make sure that you have

3198
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,980
sufficient baseline levels of those things

3199
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,950
through things like
diet, regular behaviors,

3200
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:59,430
and then you have the opportunity
to use supplementation

3201
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:01,770
and if it's appropriate for
you, prescription drugs,

3202
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:03,360
and certain behavioral protocols

3203
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:05,160
to try and get these potent increases,

3204
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:08,460
these acute increases in
whichever the neuromodulators

3205
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,910
you happen to want to leverage
for your particular goals.

3206
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:14,910
So that brings us to the end
of at least this exploration

3207
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:16,530
of the neuromodulators,

3208
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:18,330
dopamine, epinephrine,

3209
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:20,160
acetylcholine and serotonin.

3210
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:22,350
Some of you who are regular
listeners of this podcast

3211
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:24,600
might be saying, well, we've
heard all this before, right?

3212
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,830
You had an episode on dopamine.

3213
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:27,210
You had an episode on anxiety.

3214
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:28,500
You had an episode on sleep.

3215
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,480
And indeed that's true.

3216
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,250
But what I've tried to provide today

3217
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:36,300
is a framework that cuts
through all those episodes

3218
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,790
and at the same time builds out a new

3219
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:39,690
and what I believe to be

3220
02:02:39,690 --> 02:02:42,210
a really important theme and principle,

3221
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:46,260
which is that whether or not
you're using nutritional tools

3222
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:48,960
or supplementation or prescription drugs

3223
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,390
or any other sort of protocol

3224
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:54,720
to try and create a
desired effect of focus

3225
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:57,690
or energy, motivation, relaxation,

3226
02:02:57,690 --> 02:03:01,950
you are playing with the same
neurochemical ingredients,

3227
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:04,260
just as in the realm of nutrition,

3228
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:05,580
you have macronutrients,

3229
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:08,070
you have proteins, carbohydrates, and fats

3230
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:09,900
that can be adjusted in different ratios

3231
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:11,940
and arranged at different times

3232
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:14,730
in order to achieve
certain desired effects.

3233
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:17,160
Well, when it comes to your neurochemistry

3234
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:20,760
and your ability to perform
mentally, to perform physically,

3235
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:23,013
and your overall well-being,

3236
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:26,340
you are dealing with a small handful

3237
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,500
of especially potent molecules.

3238
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,920
And I acknowledge that there
are many neuromodulators.

3239
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,840
There are indeed many neurotransmitters,

3240
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:36,300
glutamine, glycine, GABA, et cetera.

3241
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:38,640
But today we focused on the main four,

3242
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,470
meaning the most potent

3243
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:44,820
and most widespread neuromodulators
in the brain and body

3244
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:48,000
that give you access to
particular brain states

3245
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,930
and body states of the sort
that most people desire.

3246
02:03:51,930 --> 02:03:53,970
So what I'm hoping is that

3247
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:57,030
rather than decide that any
one tool is the most useful

3248
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:59,340
or that any one neurochemical

3249
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,560
is most useful for that matter,

3250
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:03,750
that the information
that I've provided today

3251
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:07,170
allows you a kit of versatile tools

3252
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:09,150
that allows you to figure out

3253
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:13,020
what levels of dopamine and
augmentation of dopamine

3254
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:15,000
are appropriate and necessary for you.

3255
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,670
What levels of acetylcholine

3256
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:20,130
and tools for manipulating acetylcholine

3257
02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:21,600
are going to be most useful for you

3258
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,190
and so on and so forth

3259
02:04:23,190 --> 02:04:26,730
because at least at this stage in time,

3260
02:04:26,730 --> 02:04:30,120
that is June, 2022,

3261
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:32,220
there is no simple at home test.

3262
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:34,860
In fact, there is no
simple laboratory test

3263
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:36,390
that allows us to know whether or not

3264
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:37,377
our dopamine levels are high

3265
02:04:37,377 --> 02:04:39,270
and our serotonin levels are low.

3266
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:41,220
We can look at somebody
and their behavior.

3267
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:44,070
We can look at ourselves and
our own mood and behavior.

3268
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:48,780
And we can infer what those
levels may or may not be.

3269
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:53,070
But unfortunately, we don't
have a really good test

3270
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:55,230
of dopamine levels or serotonin levels

3271
02:04:55,230 --> 02:04:57,360
that would allow us to say,

3272
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:01,890
okay, this person, or I need
to increase dopamine two-fold

3273
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:04,860
in order to achieve the kind
of motivation that we want.

3274
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:06,240
Unfortunately, that doesn't exist.

3275
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,060
Rather, we are confronted with a situation

3276
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:10,920
where we understand

3277
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:12,990
generally what these
different neuromodulators do,

3278
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:14,970
the different mental
states and physical states

3279
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:16,710
that they tend to put us into.

3280
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:17,880
And we reviewed those.

3281
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:21,750
And we know that there
are really potent tools

3282
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:23,820
to adjust those neuromodulators,

3283
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:26,910
if not alone, but in certain combinations,

3284
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:30,360
that is ingestion of
caffeine will tap into

3285
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:33,750
and support dopamine and epinephrine.

3286
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:36,210
Increasing dopamine and epinephrine

3287
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:39,390
alongside increasing acetylcholine

3288
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:41,550
will allow us to access
certain brain states,

3289
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:44,730
that is focused, alert,
energized, brain states,

3290
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:47,820
great for learning and
plasticity of all kinds.

3291
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:50,610
Whereas augmenting
serotonin is going to put us

3292
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:52,950
into a more relaxed state
and so on and so forth.

3293
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:54,660
And I'd like you to keep in mind

3294
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:57,300
that there is no negotiating

3295
02:05:57,300 --> 02:05:59,700
the fact that we all have different phases

3296
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:01,050
of our 24-hour cycle

3297
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:03,300
during which those very
same neuromodulators

3298
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:05,880
tend to be naturally
higher or naturally lower

3299
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:08,190
and I reviewed that at the
beginning of the episode.

3300
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:11,100
So my wish for you is that you
will take this information,

3301
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:15,420
experiment with it as you see
fit for you and in a safe way.

3302
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:17,430
And as you go forward,

3303
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:20,460
to really try and gain
intuition and understanding

3304
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:23,430
as to not just how these protocols work,

3305
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:26,190
but how any protocol
that you might encounter,

3306
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:28,620
supplement-based, drug-based,

3307
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,700
behavioral-based,

3308
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,290
how those might tap into these different

3309
02:06:31,290 --> 02:06:32,850
major neuromodulator systems.

3310
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:35,370
And from that, to be
able to better predict

3311
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:36,600
and evaluate whether or not

3312
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,950
they're going to be useful to you,

3313
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:39,090
detrimental to you,

3314
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:41,280
or whether or not they should
be used in combinations

3315
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:42,840
that would be more useful to you.

3316
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,180

3327
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:07,200
We do eventually read all those comments

3328
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:10,560
and that's the best place to
give us that sort of feedback.

3329

In addition, please check out the sponsors

3330
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:14,190
mentioned at the beginning
of today's episode.

02:07:14,190 --> 02:07:17,100
That's the best way to
support this podcast.

3332
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:18,090
During today's episode,

3333
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:19,770
we talked a lot about supplements.

3334
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:22,020
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

3335
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:24,510
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.

3336
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:26,340
As mentioned at the
beginning of today's episode,

3337
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:28,440
we partnered with Momentous supplements

3338
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:29,940
because they're extremely high quality,

3339
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:31,740
they ship internationally,

3340
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:33,600
they are available in the dosages

3341
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:35,940
and single ingredient formulations

3342
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:38,250
that are ideal for building
a supplementation protocol.

3343
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:41,850
You can find all those at
liveMomentous.com/huberman.

3344
02:07:41,850 --> 02:07:44,070
If you're not already
following us on social media,

3345
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:46,260
we are @hubermanlab on Twitter

3346
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:48,480
and @hubermanlab on Instagram.

3347
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,850
There, I cover science
and science-based tools,

3348
02:07:50,850 --> 02:07:52,500
some of which overlap with the content

3349
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:54,150
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3350
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:55,440
but much of which is distinct

3351
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:57,840
from the content of the
Huberman Lab Podcast.

3352
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:00,030
And if you're not already
subscribing to our newsletter,

3353
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:02,550
we have a Neural Network
Newsletter as it's called.

3354
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,620
It comes out about once a month.

3355
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,300
We provide summaries.

3356
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:09,480
We provide protocols
based on podcast episodes.

3357
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:11,190
All of that is zero cost to access.

3358
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:13,890
You just go to Hubermanlab.com,
go to the menu,

3359
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:15,630
click on newsletter, and you can sign up.

3360
02:08:15,630 --> 02:08:17,670
We do not share your email with anybody

3361
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:19,770
and our privacy policy is there.

3362
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:22,110
In fact, if you want to
see previous newsletters,

3363
02:08:22,110 --> 02:08:24,420
they are available
without having to sign up

3364
02:08:24,420 --> 02:08:27,120
in PDF form also at HubermanLab.com

3365
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:28,590
under the newsletter tabs,

3366
02:08:28,590 --> 02:08:30,270
things like a toolkit for sleep

3367
02:08:30,270 --> 02:08:32,310
and a neuroplasticity super protocol,

3368
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:35,220
all available as immediately
downloadable PDFs.

3369
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:38,040
So I'd like to thank you once
again for joining me today

3370
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:41,070
in our discussion about these
incredibly powerful molecules

3371
02:08:41,070 --> 02:08:43,200
we call neuromodulators

3372
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,290
and the things we can do and take

3373
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:48,000
in order to control them

3374
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,340
so that we can enhance our
mental health, physical health

3375
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:51,540
and performance.

3376
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,940
And last, but certainly not least,

3377
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:55,862
thank you for your interest in science.

3378
02:08:55,862 --> 02:08:58,445
