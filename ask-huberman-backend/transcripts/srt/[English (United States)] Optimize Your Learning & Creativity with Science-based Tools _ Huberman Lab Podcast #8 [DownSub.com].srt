1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,720
where we discuss science,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,823
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,910
- My name is Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,950
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,020
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,160
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,440
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,490
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,220
to bring you zero cost to
consumer information about science

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,300
and science related tools.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,490
And keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,430
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,990
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,510
InsideTracker analyzes
data from your blood

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,200
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,650
and health and health needs.

18
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,200
I've been getting my blood
tested for many years now.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,880
Because, it just turns out that many

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
of the things that are
important to our health

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,400
and wellbeing can only be detected

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,760
in a blood test or a DNA test.

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,940
InsideTracker makes that really easy.

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,770
They can come to your
house to take those samples

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,890
if you like, or you can go
to a nearby clinic as well.

26
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,170
The major problem with most blood tests

27
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,500
and DNA tests is that it's
very hard to make sense

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,333
of the information you get.

29
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,300
You get a lot of numbers
related to metabolic factors,

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,210
endocrine factors, et cetera.

31
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,270
InsideTracker makes it very easy,

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,710
to decipher what those levels,

33
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,600
in your blood and DNA mean,
and what to do about them.

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,770
They have a very easy to use
dashboard that if you go to it,

35
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,400
it can inform about
lifestyle choices such as,

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,910
adding or subtracting certain forms

37
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,210
of exercise or nutrition,

38
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,250
other things related to supplementation.

39
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,180
It's a really powerful
and easy to use program.

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,360
If you wanna try InsideTracker,

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
and put Huberman at checkout

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,700
to get 25% off any of their programs.

44
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,430
That's insidetracker.com/huberman,

45
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,963
and put Huberman at checkout.

46
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,930
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

47
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,620
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one,

48
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,330
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

49
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,047
I've been using Athletic
Greens since 2012.

50
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,980
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

51
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,560
I started using Athletic Greens

52
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,740
and I still use Athletic Greens,

53
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,509
because I find it very complicated

54
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,549
and almost dizzying to
figure out which vitamins

55
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,660
and minerals I need to take

56
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,590
in order to just cover
my nutritional basis.

57
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,890
Taking Athletic Greens
makes that very easy.

58
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,260
It also tastes very good.

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,490
I mix mine with water,

60
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,940
a little bit of lemon
juice, and I really like it.

61
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,920
So I drink it once or twice a day.

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
The probiotics that are

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,530
in Athletic Greens are
also important to me.

64
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,380
Because there are a lot

65
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,110
of data now showing
that the gut microbiome,

66
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,140
which is supported by probiotics,

67
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,640
is important for things
like the gut brain access,

68
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,470
mood, endocrine factors,

69
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,670
metabolism, many, many
biological functions.

70
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,000
And so by taking Athletic
Greens, I get the vitamins,

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,020
the minerals and the
probiotics all in one.

72
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,410
Easy to consume, great tasting drink.

73
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,360
If you wanna try Athletic
Greens you can go

74
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,160
to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

75
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,410
And if you do that you'll
also get, a one year supply

76
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,330
of liquid vitamin D three K two.

77
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,090
There are a lot of data now as well,

78
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,030
showing that vitamin D three is important

79
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,520
for immune function, for
mood, endocrine factors,

80
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,720
as well as other systems
in the brain and body.

81
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,050
That's athleticgreens.com/huberman.

82
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,040
And I should also mention

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,290
if you do that you won't just get

84
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,560
the vitamin D three K two year supply,

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,770
you'll also get five free travel packs

86
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,720
of Athletic Greens.

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,610
Mixing up powders

88
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,540
when one is on the road,
either in the car or in a hotel

89
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,630
or on the plane, et
cetera, can be kinda messy.

90
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,210
These little travel packs
make it really clean and easy.

91
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,310
So once again, if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

92
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,680
you'll get a special offer,
of your Athletic Greens

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,950
but you'll also get the year supply

94
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,500
of vitamin D3 K2, and the
five free travel packs.

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,900
The third sponsor of
today's podcast is Madefor.

96
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,340
Madefor is a behavioral science company

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,860
that makes attaining positive changes

98
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,610
and growth mindset easy,

99
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,100
through a simple set of
steps, and a monthly program.

100
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,040
The company was founded
by former Navy SEAL

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,660
Patrick Dossett and Toms
founder, Blake Mycoskie.

102
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm the head of their
scientific advisory board.

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,630
And the other members
of the advisory board,

104
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,310
include people like the director
of the chronobiology unit

105
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,260
the National Institute of Mental Health,

106
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,920
members of Harvard Medical School,

107
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,720
and many other people who are
serious about taking science

108
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,530
and developing protocols,

109
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,060
that can be applied
towards positive habits,

110
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,620
and growth mindset.

111
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,290
If you wanna check out Madefor,

112
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,420
you can go to getmadefor.com.

113
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,390
And if you purchase any of their products

114
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,210
and put Huberman at checkout,

115
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,060
you'll get 20% off their program.

116
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,170
In addition to that, we
do a monthly Zoom call,

117
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,970
where the members of Madefor get on it.

118
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,750
And Patrick and myself,
sometimes Blake as well,

119
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,550
discuss the Madefor program
and the personal goals

120
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,450
and things that people
are trying to achieve

121
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,300
with the program.

122
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,360
So it's a dialogue back and
forth on Zoom call once a month.

123
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,300
Once again, that's getmadefor.com,

124
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,710
put in Huberman at checkout,

125
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,010
and you'll be able to
get the 20% off as well

126
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,980
as access to the monthly
Zoom calls with us.

127
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,540
Let's talk about neuroplasticity.

128
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,350
More specifically, let's talk about how,

129
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,870
we can optimize our brains.

130
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,580
Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature

131
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,300
of our nervous system that allows it

132
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,300
to change itself, even in ways
that we consciously decide.

133
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,100
That's an incredible property.

134
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,900
Our liver can't decide
to just change itself.

135
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,730
Our spleen can't decide
to just change itself,

136
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,030
through conscious thought,

137
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,280
or through feedback from another person.

138
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,220
The cells in those tissues
can make changes sure,

139
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,910
but it's our nervous system,

140
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,400
that harbors this incredible ability

141
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,170
to direct its own changes,

142
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,170
in ways that we believe, or
we're told will serve us better.

143
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,640
Now, today's a really
special episode because,

144
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,850
while we are going to talk about science

145
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,623
and as always we will
delve into mechanism.

146
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,300
Today's episode is really geared

147
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,750
toward answering your
most common questions

148
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,470
about how to leverage neuroplasticity.

149
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,920
The previous episodes were about focus,

150
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,910
and how to achieve focus
for sake of plasticity.

151
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,890
As well as the last episode which is,

152
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,723
what are some

153
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:04,240
of the portals into plasticity
that relate to movement,

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,600
how behavior can activate plasticity,

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,100
as well as how to activate
plasticity for behavior itself.

156
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,960
How to get better at
learning certain movements.

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,190
Today's podcast is really directed

158
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,980
toward answering your
most common questions,

159
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,440
and the bigger theme,

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,270
of how does one go about
optimizing their brain

161
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,550
or even think about, optimizing the brain?

162
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,140
What is this thing that we're calling

163
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,890
optimizing the brain?

164
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,610
In doing so I'm also
gonna share some of my,

165
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,650
typical routines and tools.

166
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,593
I don't share these because I think

167
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,900
that they are the only ones
that are available out there.

168
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,010
Certainly they're not.

169
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,843
Nor do I share them

170
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:39,360
because I think that
everyone should do them just

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,040
'cause I do them, certainly not.

172
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,180
I share them because many of you,

173
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,740
have asked for very concrete
examples of what I do and when,

174
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,050
and so I'll share those with you

175
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,010
and you can decide whether
or not those protocols are

176
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,550
for you or not.

177
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,810
Everybody's different, but
there are some common features,

178
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,020
of how we are all put together,

179
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,250
at the level of the
nervous system and body,

180
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,740
that direct us

181
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,430
toward particular practices,
particular routines

182
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,010
that can be especially
powerful, for neuroplasticity.

183
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,190
So I wanna open up the discussion today,

184
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,690
by emphasizing something,
that's fundamentally important.

185
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,350
Which is that plasticity, is not the goal.

186
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,740
Plasticity is never the goal.

187
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,380
Plasticity is simply a state,

188
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,670
or a capacity, for our
nervous system to change.

189
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,340
And so, nothing makes me more frustrated,

190
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,620
perhaps then when I hear,
oh, you know, this pill,

191
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,360
this potion, this practice,
it gives you plasticity.

192
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,560
Plasticity is just change.

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,780
The real question is what
are you trying to change?

194
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,730
And specifically what end goal
are you trying to achieve?

195
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,530
Specific end goals might
be extremely specific.

196
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,650
Like, you want to learn how
to speak a particular language

197
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,880
or you want to learn a new motor skill

198
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,100
or you want to get very good at calculus,

199
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,190
or you'd like to forget
the bad emotions related

200
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,540
to a particular human being or experience,

201
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,760
or it can be more general.

202
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,310
Like you'd like to be more creative.

203
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,370
And we'll actually talk
about creativity today.

204
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,500
Or you would like to achieve more focus

205
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,290
or you'd like to be less stressed.

206
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,770
So it's very important, that
you understand that plasticity,

207
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,720
and achieving plasticity
is the first step,

208
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,400
in what we call optimizing your brain.

209
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
You don't want your brain
to be plastic all the time.

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,940
In fact, one of the major questions,

211
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,360
one of the major unsolved
mysteries of neuroscience

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
is how each and every one
of us wakes up every day,

213
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
and knows who we are.

214
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,020
Why should that be?

215
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,760
Well, the brain is plastic.

216
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,090
It has a capacity to change
throughout the lifespan

217
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,460
but it's not so plastic, that every night

218
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,720
when we go to sleep, or in our waking

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,870
that the connections get
reconfigured so much so

220
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,823
that we forget who we are, or
how to walk, or how to eat.

221
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,220
It's a good thing that we don't have,

222
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,190
such robust plasticity
or ongoing plasticity,

223
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,270
that we have to restructure
ourselves each day.

224
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,500
It's part of what gives
our life continuity.

225
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,340
So remember, plasticity is
not and is never the goal.

226
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,560
The goal is to figure out
how to access plasticity,

227
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,870
and then to direct that
plasticity, toward particular goals

228
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,540
or changes that you would like to achieve.

229
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,040
And I should just mention,

230
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,910
there's no rule that in life you have

231
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,570
to leverage this incredible
thing called neuro-plasticity.

232
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,160
No one said you had to do that.

233
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,420
This podcast in this episode
is particularly for people,

234
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,070
who are either happy or
unhappy with where they're at

235
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,060
with a particular aspect of their life.

236
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,840
And they wanna shift it,
in some positive way.

237
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,990
And many of you listening might say,

238
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,103
well wouldn't everyone wanna do that?

239
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:43,950
Well actually, there are a certain number

240
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,470
of people that are pretty
good where they're at

241
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,160
and they don't wanna
change and that's terrific.

242
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,000
And I tip my hat to them and
I think that's wonderful.

243
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,040
If ever they decide

244
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,320
that they wanna leverage
these plasticity mechanisms,

245
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,123
they can, at any stage
throughout the lifespan.

246
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,790
Let's start by talking
about the different systems

247
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,560
within the nervous system,

248
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,870
that are available for plasticity.

249
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,010
And in doing so, I'll
frame them in the context

250
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,580
of what I do on a daily basis,

251
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,343
on a weekly basis, and on a yearly basis.

252
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,700
First of all, there are
several forms of plasticity.

253
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,230
They have names like
long-term potentiation,

254
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,290
long-term depression,
which has nothing to do

255
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,800
with emotional depression, by the way.

256
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,970
And things like
spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

257
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,190
Those names are used to
describe cellular phenomenon.

258
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,360
The actual ways that the
synapses, the connections

259
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,110
between neurons change.

260
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,070
I'll mention those things

261
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,782
and I'll give a little more [indistinct]

262
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:41,060
to what they are as I mentioned them.

263
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,530
But, that's probably not
the best way to think

264
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,610
about plasticity in terms
of optimizing your brain.

265
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,810
The best way to think about
it is in terms of short term,

266
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,350
medium term, and long-term plasticity.

267
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,830
Short-term plasticity, is any kind

268
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,450
of shift that you want to achieve,

269
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,510
in the moment or in the day,

270
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,330
but that you don't necessarily
wanna hold on to forever.

271
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,310
You might say, well, what
kinds of things are those?

272
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,400
Well, for instance, short-term
plasticity might be,

273
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,900
you wake up earlier than you
would like to catch a flight.

274
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,470
You're not feeling particularly alert,

275
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,950
and you want to use a protocol,

276
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,690
or you decide to use a
protocol which could be coffee

277
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,390
or it could be a certain form of breathing

278
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,670
or it could be some other tool,

279
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,290
to become more alert at a time of day

280
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,090
when normally you aren't that alert.

281
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,630
But, your expectation is
that when you return home,

282
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,350
you will discard with that,

283
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,310
the need to do that at 5:30 AM

284
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,040
because you'll be asleep at 5:30 AM.

285
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
So there's short-term plasticity,
behavioral plasticity.

286
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,210
Then there's medium-term plasticity

287
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,230
which are changes, that
you might wanna make.

288
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,060
I call this with respect,
and a little bit of humor,

289
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,300
or at least my kinda humor.

290
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,300
I call this the undergraduate,
pre-med phenomenon.

291
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,870
For those of you that
have worked with pre-meds.

292
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,010
And I have tremendous respect

293
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,300
for medical students and pre-meds,

294
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,190
there is a kind of a stereotype

295
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,630
which I don't necessarily agree with,

296
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,460
but the stereotype is that they wanna know

297
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,100
what they need to know
for sake of the exam,

298
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,120
but they don't really wanna know.

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,330
They just want the A.

300
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,730
And I don't think that's always true.

301
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,060
I've worked with a number

302
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,460
of different pre-meds over the years

303
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,400
and there are many of
them that are absolutely,

304
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,930
passionate about the knowledge itself.

305
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,600
And they also wanted the A.

306
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,630
But the pre-med phenomenon
as it's discussed

307
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,340
among professors and
TAs, is that, you know,

308
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,320
you've got these students,

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,740
they just wanna know
what they need to know

310
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,090
so they can get the A, right?

311
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,520
It's medium-term plasticity.

312
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,930
They don't actually want it to be embedded

313
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,490
in their memory too long,

314
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,280
or else they would actually
care about the information.

315
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,430
So that's medium term information.

316
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,170
And sometimes that's useful for instance

317
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,690
if you go on vacation to Costa Rica,

318
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,710
and you don't know your
way around Costa Rica.

319
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,040
You wanna learn the different
town and the routes there.

320
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,070
But you don't have any
intention of going back.

321
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,950
It's just medium term.

322
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,220
You wanna just program it in
for sake of your time there

323
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,830
and then you wanna discard it.

324
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,663
Most of the time

325
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,770
when we think about or talk
about optimizing the brain,

326
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,170
we're talking about long-term plasticity.

327
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,890
We're talking about the kinds of changes

328
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,723
that people wanna make

329
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:06,650
so that their brain
reflexively works differently.

330
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,930
This is what a child does

331
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,770
when it goes from not knowing how to walk

332
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,780
to knowing how to walk.

333
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,760
It doesn't have to think

334
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,090
about it after it learns how to walk.

335
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,403
It becomes reflexive.

336
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,540
Long-term plasticity, is
almost always the big goal.

337
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,310
It's I wanna know how
to speak that language.

338
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,090
I wanna be able to do that skill.

339
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,760
I wanna be able to feel this way,

340
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,960
without having to put much work into it.

341
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,793
And there are tools

342
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:29,640
and protocols that one
can do to achieve that.

343
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,130
And we are going to talk about those.

344
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,060
We've talked about a few of
them in previous episodes

345
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,433
but I will revisit those protocols today.

346
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,460
I'm gonna frame all this

347
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,630
in the context of the daily
life, the weekly life,

348
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,700
and the yearly life.

349
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
And that's because,

350
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,203
neuroplasticity and optimizing your brain,

351
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,500
rides on a deeper foundation,

352
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,810
of this thing that governs plasticity.

353
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,120
In fact, governs all our
life, called autonomic arousal

354
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,720
which is that we're asleep
for part of the 24 hour cycle

355
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,400
and we are awake almost always.

356
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,740
If we push ourselves and
stay awake, we're okay.

357
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,210
We can do that for a night or two,

358
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,440
but almost always we are
asleep for a portion of it

359
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,290
and we are awake for a portion of it.

360
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,840
I've said it before but I'll say it again.

361
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,080
The trigger for plasticity
in learning occurs

362
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,820
during high focus, high alertness states,

363
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,630
not while you're asleep.

364
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,650
And the focus and alertness are both key

365
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,683
because of the neurochemicals
associated with those states.

366
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,470
But, the actual rewiring
and the reconfiguration

367
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,670
of the brain connections happens
during non sleep deep rest,

368
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,760
which we'll talk more about as always.

369
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,910
And, deep sleep.

370
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,170
So you trigger the change and
in sleep you get the change.

371
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,270
So, some of the things
that we'll talk about today

372
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,940
about optimizing the brain,

373
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,970
are centered around not sleep,

374
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,640
but around the autonomic arousal system.

375
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,320
We have this system of
neurons in our brain and body

376
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,900
that's just incredible, that
wake us up and make us alert.

377
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,370
And when we're not accessing that system,

378
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,230
well, we cannot access plasticity.

379
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,250
We can not optimize our brain.

380
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,210
Likewise, if we cannot sleep
well, and we can't rest well,

381
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,820
we will not access plasticity
and rewire our brain

382
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,700
because that's when the
actual configuration

383
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,570
between the connections occurs.

384
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,240
So to set this in context,

385
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,990
I wake up each day, and
I'll be totally honest.

386
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,150
I usually don't feel like
bouncing right out of bed.

387
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,880
I usually don't feel completely rested.

388
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,080
And that's not because I
don't get enough sleep.

389
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,120
It's probably because I'm not terrific

390
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,350
about timing my sleep so well.

391
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,890
Now this month isn't about sleep,

392
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,890
that was the previous month

393
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,023
but I really wanna emphasize a few points.

394
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,040
I wake up, generally more tired,

395
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,060
and groggy than I would like,

396
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,380
because I tend to go to sleep too late.

397
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,887
It's just some thing that I do.

398
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:52,960
And I tend to get up early
either because I set an alarm,

399
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,330
because I have things to do,

400
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,170
or because I naturally wake up early

401
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,790
because the light coming in and so forth.

402
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,960
Well, what that tells me is

403
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,140
that I'm probably somebody
whose natural circadian rhythm.

404
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,440
You may have heard of chronotypes.

405
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,060
These are genetically programmed things.

406
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,670
But chronotype, is shorter than 24 hours.

407
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,120
It means that the cycle of waking

408
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,820
and alertness for me is
probably shorter than 24 hours.

409
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,410
Which means that getting some light

410
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,240
in the late afternoon will help me shift,

411
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,900
and make my cycle a little bit longer.

412
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,020
It will phase delay me

413
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,050
if that doesn't make any
sense, see a previous episode.

414
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,580
But what it really means
is getting some light

415
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,850
in the afternoon, will allow me

416
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,840
to stay up a little bit later.

417
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,780
But what it means is that,

418
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm not really matching
my hard-wired needs

419
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,170
of going to bed probably at 8:30 or 9:00

420
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,030
and waking up at 4:00 AM.

421
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,230
I tend to go to sleep around 10:30, 11:00,

422
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,840
lately around 11:30 or 12:00

423
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,707
and then I wake up at 6:00.

424
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,790
And so of course, I'm gonna feel groggy.

425
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,950
So neuroplasticity will allow
me, to optimize my wakefulness

426
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,110
but I have to do something
in order to access that.

427
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,130
And some of you may
already be anticipating

428
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,430
what I'm about to say, which is,

429
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,720
oh, no he's gonna tell us
to get sunlight in our eyes

430
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,440
in the first 30 minutes of the day.

431
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,700
I am gonna tell you to do that,

432
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,470
but I'm gonna also tell you two things

433
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,810
that I've have not discussed before,

434
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,240
which relate to the plasticity,

435
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,926
between the melanopsin cells.

436
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:15,879
These sunlight detecting,
bright light detecting cells

437
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,210
in our eye and the circadian clock.

438
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,950
I've never said this
before in this podcast,

439
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,760
but it turns out that the connections

440
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,900
between these melanopsin
cells and the circadian clock,

441
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,650
are plastic throughout the lifespan.

442
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,300
There's a massive configuration
of the connections there.

443
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,080
And a cell type called the astrocytes

444
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,650
which are a glial cell,

445
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,130
are actively removing and
reinforcing connections

446
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,480
between the eye and that clock, every day.

447
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,330
Now this is incredible
because other aspects

448
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,330
of your brain that for instance,

449
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,960
represent you knowing who you are,

450
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,010
when you wake up in the morning,

451
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,450
or what your name is, assuming
that you're old enough

452
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,160
that you've already learned your name.

453
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,690
When the first things kids learn

454
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,533
and something we rarely ever forget.

455
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,900
Those connections, are changing all

456
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,510
the time every 24 hour cycle.

457
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,270
So there's an opportunity
for short-term plasticity.

458
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,040
So that's why I view sunlight
first thing in the day,

459
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,370
it helps me wake up.

460
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,620
The other thing that I do
is that there's a circuit,

461
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,560
that exists between the circadian clock

462
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,120
and our adrenals that I've talked

463
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,750
about before that triggers the release

464
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,640
of cortisol first thing in
the morning, that wakes us up.

465
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,450
Especially when we view light.

466
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,760
So if you're groggy in the morning

467
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
that's why viewing light is helpful.

468
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,740
But, the interesting thing is

469
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,820
if you start viewing light
frequently in the morning,

470
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,010
then those connections
between the melanopsin cells

471
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,290
and the circadian clock, become primed

472
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,850
or potentiated we would say,

473
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,800
they become stronger for
the anticipation of light.

474
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,030
And you naturally start waking up earlier,

475
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,490
feeling more alert.

476
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,250
So, what this says is

477
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,810
and what I do is I get that
regular light because I know

478
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,810
that some mornings,

479
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,370
I'm just not gonna feel very alert,

480
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,950
I'll feel, especially tired.

481
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,720
And I might not be able to access sunlight

482
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,500
because it's really
overcast or I'm traveling,

483
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,360
or some other feature.

484
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,630
But the system is plastic

485
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,950
so it shifted in the right direction.

486
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,420
Now it will shift back,

487
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,810
because it's short-term plasticity

488
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,910
after about two, three days.

489
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,743
So you wanna try

490
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,090
and get the sunlight
exposure on a regular basis.

491
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,100
The other thing that I do is
I delay my intake of caffeine,

492
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,020
for the first two hours that I'm awake.

493
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,860
Now, this can be very painful for people.

494
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,400
But, earlier we talked
about, the adenosine system

495
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,720
and how the accumulation of
adenosine makes us sleepy.

496
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,990
And caffeine suppresses adenosine

497
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,570
and it makes us feel alert.

498
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,610
But we know,

499
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,650
that if you ingest caffeine,
immediately on waking,

500
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,770
the signal to the adrenals,
to release cortisol,

501
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,090
which is a healthy release of cortisol,

502
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,806
and the suppression of adenosine

503
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:43,183
that happens as we come out of sleep,

504
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,230
and in deep sleep the
suppression of adenosine,

505
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,680
if you ingest caffeine too
early, there's a mechanism

506
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,090
by which the adenosine competes
for the receptors et cetera,

507
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,800
so that you have a mid-morning crash.

508
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,560
Because if caffeine, the way it works is

509
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,390
if caffeine is occupying
the adenosine receptor,

510
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,720
then the natural endogenous mechanisms,

511
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,780
for suppressing adenosine,

512
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,860
are not actually gonna have their action.

513
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,620
So the brain to adrenal axis,
is subject to plasticity also.

514
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,330
And so by delaying caffeine

515
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,610
until about two hours after waking,

516
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,370
I'm able to capture, and
reinforce, to potentiate,

517
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,150
the neural circuit that exists
between the circadian clock

518
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,300
and the cortisol released in the adrenals,

519
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,830
as well as, leave those
adenosine receptors,

520
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,000
unoccupied so that I can
then use the caffeine

521
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,640
to get a natural lift,

522
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,330
in alertness and focus
two hours later as opposed

523
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,420
to using it, just to wake
myself up out of sleepiness.

524
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,900
So while I'm sure there are
some eye-rolls out there

525
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,500
and some yawns, about,

526
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,610
oh no, it's the sunlight
in the morning thing again.

527
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,860
It's a powerful tool, for
readjusting these circuits.

528
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,390
So the short-term plasticity.

529
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,223
And the reason

530
00:20:53,223 --> 00:20:55,140
for delaying caffeine
for the first two hours

531
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,800
of the day even if it's painful
to do for the first couple

532
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,420
of days is that then you
naturally start to wake up,

533
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,940
more readily in the morning
without caffeine because,

534
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,880
the adenosine is suppressed

535
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,430
and you don't have these competing.

536
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,730
It's called a competing antagonist,

537
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,090
for the adenosine receptor.

538
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,520
So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes.

539
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,700
Lately because I wake up very
early I do use a bright light,

540
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,570
to stimulate alertness.

541
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,340
It's not actually
designed for that purpose.

542
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,770
It's just a light board
that has been about 900 lux.

543
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,220
And then I delay caffeine.

544
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,413
Some of you have asked,

545
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,600
and again I'm not saying
anyone has to do this.

546
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,020
You know, what exactly do you drink?

547
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,990
I'm a big believer in black coffee.

548
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,530
I just happen to like black coffee.

549
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,850
People have asked me about,

550
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,170
and I don't wanna name brand names here

551
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,500
about this type of coffee or,

552
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,680
that type of coffee you
mixed with these other,

553
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,130
kinds of things.

554
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,990
Will that increase focus?

555
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,220
You know, I'm gonna talk today a lot about

556
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,290
the use of diet and
fasting and timing of foods

557
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,610
and certain kinds of foods.

558
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,600
But to be honest, black
coffee is just a simple choice

559
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,930
that's always worked for me.

560
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,240
I also make sure I hydrate
first thing in the morning.

561
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,130
There is plenty of data now
showing that even a slight,

562
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,510
increase in dehydration,

563
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,370
meaning just when you're lacking water,

564
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,300
can make people have headaches.

565
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,780
It can provide some additional photophobia

566
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,860
for those of you that are migraine prone.

567
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,440
Bright light can trigger migraines.

568
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,680
That's no surprise to those of you

569
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,860
that get headaches and migraines.

570
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,440
But dehydration, can compound,

571
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,350
the vulnerability to
migraine and headache.

572
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,960
So I drink water, I drink
black coffee, or I drink mate

573
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,450
which is just because I
have Argentine lineage

574
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,140
which is just a high
caffeine drink first thing

575
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,973
in the morning,

576
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:37,313
but I delay it until two
hours after I wake up.

577
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,190
And that's because, I want the circuits

578
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,750
between my eye and my circadian
clock and my adrenals,

579
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,880
to be functioning in a particular way,

580
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,240
so that then later the
caffeine is an addition.

581
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,010
It adds more alertness.

582
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,310
Now this is a discussion about
how to optimize your brain.

583
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,580
Many people who wake up quickly,

584
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,150
and just naturally feel
like bouncing out of bed.

585
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,950
I envy these people.

586
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,400
They will do just fine,

587
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,680
by going into a learning
bout or taking care of,

588
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,170
whatever it is that they
need to take care of.

589
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,430
Sometimes that's kind
of more mundane tasks

590
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,040
like email and whatnot.

591
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,630
Here's a more or less a rule

592
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,350
about how the brain
functions, vis-a-vis, focus,

593
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,910
learning and creativity.

594
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,620
And I'm gonna discuss this
much more in future episodes.

595
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,300
Generally states of high alertness,

596
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,110
when we're very very alert,

597
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,410
are great for strategy implementation.

598
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,810
When we already know how to do something.

599
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,130
And it's just simply a matter

600
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,263
of plugging the correct
elements into the correct boxes.

601
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,950
I've talked before about
duration, path and outcome,

602
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,980
as the three things

603
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,130
that the deliberate
conscious brain is trying

604
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,080
to figure out in order
to perform certain tasks,

605
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,930
even cognitive tasks.

606
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,140
This is the sort of thing
that we are very good at

607
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,760
when we're well rested, and we're focused.

608
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,290
In our autonomic arousal

609
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,460
or our alertness rather
is at a high level.

610
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,880
If you are somebody who is
hitting that alertness phase

611
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,620
of your day, very early,
right after you wake up,

612
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,260
that's a great time to move
right into things that,

613
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,790
at least the research says,

614
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,700
you already know, have the strategy

615
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,140
and you just wanna implement the strategy.

616
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,130
This is where I fundamentally depart

617
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,450
from the idea that, oh, you
know, you have to do the hardest

618
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,960
or most critical tasks throughout the day.

619
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,300
Sometimes the hardest
and most critical tasks,

620
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,520
are tasks that require creativity.

621
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,040
And as we'll soon talk about creativity,

622
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,070
and tasks related to it,

623
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,300
oftentimes come to us best

624
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,250
or the brain is best at achieving those,

625
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,420
when we're in states of calm
or even slightly drowsy.

626
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,790
Which is something that's interesting

627
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,100
in what we'll get into.

628
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,500
But for me, for instance,

629
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,230
I get up, I'm not terribly
alert, first thing.

630
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,167
And so I try and just get my brain

631
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:54,950
and my thoughts organized.

632
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,000
It's not a time for me to be responding

633
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,040
in a very linear fashion to emails

634
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,050
or carrying out calculations.

635
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,287
That comes about two hours later.

636
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,770
And I think many people
out there will relate,

637
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,670
mid-morning is when many people
tend to achieve their peak

638
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,480
in alertness and focus.

639
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,770
Now, many times I get the question and

640
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,760
this what I'm about to
say is directly related

641
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,840
to the hundreds of
questions I got about this.

642
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,120
Should I use, background
music in order to learn?

643
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,360
Should I have, you know,
construction next door?

644
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,860
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

645
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,290
Is it better to be in
complete silence, et cetera?

646
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,230
Now this will vary.

647
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,510
Some people can tolerate their own noise

648
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,030
within their head much better than others.

649
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,600
Other people find that
having some background noise,

650
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,083
helps cancel that out.

651
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,320
But there's a simple rule

652
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,740
of thumb that one can use,

653
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,850
because at least my experience

654
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,620
is that sometimes background
music, background noise

655
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,130
is very helpful for allowing me to focus.

656
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,740
And other times, it's very distracting.

657
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,860
So what actually governs that?

658
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,260
Well, we have to ask ourselves,

659
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,550
what is at the source,
of the lack of focus?

660
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,440
If our lack of focus is
because our autonomic arousal

661
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,580
or our alertness is very, very high.

662
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,830
We had a little too much coffee,

663
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,410
or if there is such a thing,
slept a little too long

664
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,660
or we're really stressed
or really activated,

665
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,280
and we can't seem to focus.

666
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,060
In that case,

667
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,950
eliminating background noise,

668
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,190
and really just trying to get silence,

669
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,060
so that we can quiet some
of that autonomic arousal,

670
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,150
is going to be best

671
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,470
for learning and for implementation

672
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,360
of things we already know how to do.

673
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,950
For any kind of focus linear task.

674
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,523
Which, basically learning
is a focus linear task

675
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:38,160
is that you're just not necessarily,

676
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,520
performing well all the time.

677
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
Last time we talked about making errors.

678
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,670
So as a rule of thumb,
if you're too keyed up,

679
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,490
then silence and quiet
is going to be helpful.

680
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,253
In fact, if you're very keyed up,

681
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,830
a particular circuit,

682
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,750
related to the basal ganglia,

683
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,760
starts getting triggered more easily.

684
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,700
And this circuit, I'm
gonna talk about in depth.

685
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,430
But, it's called the go, no-go circuit.

686
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,830
We have circuits that
connect our forebrain,

687
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,270
to our structure in our brain
called the basal ganglia

688
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,320
which is actually a
collection of structures.

689
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,920
And the forebrain, which is involved

690
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,330
in rational thought and thinking
and planning and action,

691
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,120
is always trying to plan what should I do,

692
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,357
and then implement that action.

693
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,910
And the basal ganglia
are intimately involved

694
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,743
in that discussion.

695
00:27:19,743 --> 00:27:22,270
There's a reciprocal
loop of communication,

696
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,440
between basil ganglia and cortex.

697
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,340
The basal ganglia has one set

698
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,220
of connections to the cortex,

699
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,330
and the cortex back to the basal ganglia

700
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,860
that facilitates go.

701
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,240
It facilitates action.

702
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,783
And the molecule, the
neuromodulator dopamine,

703
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,870
triggers the activation of go.

704
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,360
It tends to make us
want to do more things.

705
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,450
It tends to make us bias toward action.

706
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,360
By the way that dopamine binds

707
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,060
to something called the D1 receptors.

708
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,160
Just a particular type
of dopamine receptor.

709
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,440
For those of you that wanna know.

710
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,260
The no-go pathway,

711
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,640
the pathway in the basal ganglia,

712
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,053
and cortex that suppresses action,

713
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,060
involves dopamine binding

714
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,890
to this other receptor
called the D2 receptor.

715
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,320
Now D1, D2 receptors,

716
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,620
you can't just consciously decide,

717
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,570
oh, I only want my D1
receptors and my D2 receptors

718
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,560
to be active.

719
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,450
You have to think about,

720
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,930
which sorts of states of mind and body,

721
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:23,943
facilitate go, and which
ones facilitate no-go.

722
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,590
Now this is critically important,

723
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,520
because doing focused work,

724
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,010
accessing plasticity, and learning,

725
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,750
involve doing certain
things and not doing others.

726
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,740
So here's how it works.

727
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,223
And here's how I apply
it on a daily basis.

728
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,290
Because I tend to be most alert,

729
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,560
first thing, mid-morning or so.

730
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,760
And then I generally will
have my caffeine mid-morning.

731
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,580
My peak of alertness, in
the early part of the day,

732
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,660
is occurring for me sometime
between 9:30 and 11:00 AM.

733
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,493
That's just me.

734
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:57,410
Other people might experience

735
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,210
that immediately after rolling out of bed.

736
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,490
They might be wide awake and ready to go.

737
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,840
Which case they should be cautious

738
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,239
about throwing caffeine in the mix

739
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:07,000
and it's gonna make them very, very alert.

740
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,200
There are three sort of levels,

741
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,780
of autonomic arousal of alertness,

742
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,780
that bias us more toward
go, no-go, or both.

743
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,180
And this relates, to a question

744
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,000
that I've gotten now
hundreds of times from you,

745
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,450
in the comment section for this podcast,

746
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,950
which is, is it better for me to listen

747
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,860
to music in the background
while I work and learn,

748
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,290
or should I have complete silence?

749
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,310
And the answer is it depends.

750
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,180
But it doesn't depend
randomly on who you are,

751
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,320
or even necessarily time of day,

752
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,200
it depends, on your overall
level of autonomic arousal.

753
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,980
And it depends because,

754
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,090
autonomic arousal level of alertness,

755
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,030
biases the extent to which,

756
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,750
we are more prone to gos to action,

757
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,340
or to no-gos, to suppress action.

758
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,920
And dopamine is this molecule
that's swimming around

759
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,170
and is going to buy us one
or the other responses.

760
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,003
So here's how it works.

761
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,810
Let's say, I'm very alert.

762
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,460
Maybe I got a particularly
good night's sleep

763
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,510
the night before,

764
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,330
I had a little too much coffee,

765
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,760
and I'm gonna sit down to some work.

766
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,250
The thing to know,

767
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,440
and what I always tell myself
is when I'm very alert,

768
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,870
I am very prone to go, to action,

769
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,870
but I'm also prone to, not no-go, right?

770
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,490
I'm not gonna be very good
at suppressing action.

771
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,640
So those are two different things.

772
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,970
Being biased toward
action and being biased,

773
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,560
toward suppressing action are
two different things, okay?

774
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,480
So those are push pull.

775
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,980
Toward action, suppress action.

776
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,660
So, when you're very alert,

777
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,370
the tendency is for
everything to be a stimulus.

778
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,440
This is why when people say,

779
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,040
well, should I just take a drug
that will increase my level

780
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,230
of epinephrine and alertness?

781
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,230
Will that help me learn better?

782
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,750
No, because it will make you do things,

783
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,660
but it will also make you less good

784
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,760
at suppressing actions
that you need to suppress.

785
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,160
So if I'm very alert,
particularly alert for me

786
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,390
and I recognize what
that state is, of course

787
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,430
'cause everyone will be different.

788
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,980
I know what it is for me.

789
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,670
Then I want silence for learning.

790
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,010
I want it shut down my
internet, which I do.

791
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,950
I sometimes use a program,

792
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,633
that I believe is a free
program called Freedom,

793
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,510
where it actually locks you out

794
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,390
of the internet for a particular time.

795
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,580
They're not a sponsor of the podcast.

796
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,610
I just happen to use it.

797
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,370
There's another version
of Freedom where you go

798
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,480
to the wireless thing and you turn it off.

799
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,790
You disconnect from the wireless.

800
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,623
That's the other one.

801
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:36,180
Although, many people have a
hard time not reactivating it.

802
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,055
So I'm trying to shut down

803
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:41,420
the go pathway towards distraction.

804
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,070
And the other thing that I'll do,

805
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,210
is I'll generally turn off my phone,

806
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,650
put the phone outside in the car

807
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,490
or in really extreme cases
I'll throw it up on the roof

808
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,600
which is hard for me to retrieve,
so that I can't get to it.

809
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,150
So if I'm very alert, I'm aware

810
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,010
that I will have a bias toward action.

811
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,670
It will be hard for me
to suppress non-action,

812
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,320
but that it's very nonspecific.

813
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,960
Because, the next kind of
level down of alertness,

814
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,210
or autonomic arousal is
clear, calm and focused

815
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,263
where we have that kind
of sweet spot between,

816
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,670
our willingness to pursue action.

817
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,150
We're in a mode of go, and
it's not always physical action

818
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,020
but it can be pursuing
hard bouts of learning.

819
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,420
But that our ability to
suppress is also very good.

820
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,940
And this is because, and I don't wanna get

821
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,160
into too many details,

822
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,310
because of the way that dopamine competes

823
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,810
for these dopamine one receptors

824
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,810
in the go pathway and
dopamine two receptors

825
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,053
in the no-go pathway.

826
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,120
They're always in this kind of push pull.

827
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,540
And so there is a sweet spot.

828
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
And that sweet spot isn't flow,

829
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,830
where it is in some sort

830
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,220
of state where all of a sudden
things come naturally to us.

831
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,320
The state that we're trying
to achieve that's optimal

832
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,910
for learning is one in which,

833
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,220
we have the energy and focus to pursue,

834
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,370
but we also have the energy
and focus to suppress action.

835
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,070
So the basal ganglia are kinda working

836
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,160
in a perfect kind of sing songly manner,

837
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,890
through this parallel pathway.

838
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,460
Now, as we get tired or as we
round out an ultradian cycle

839
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,733
of about 90 minutes,

840
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,640
what happens is our fatigue even

841
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,840
if it's not a physical fatigue

842
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,480
that makes us wanna go to sleep,

843
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,640
but our mental fatigue
starts to accumulate

844
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,370
because these pathways of
go, no-go are actually,

845
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,130
very metabolically consuming.

846
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,840
So what I recognize is that
as they start to falter,

847
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,570
I have a harder time engaging and going

848
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:30,330
or going toward the goal rather.

849
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,930
I also know that my reflex,

850
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,190
toward actions that are unrelated

851
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,110
to the learning are also
gonna start increasing

852
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,880
because I'm not gonna be
able to suppress action

853
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,420
and activate the no-go pathways.

854
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,960
So if this all sounds like a mouthful,

855
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,470
let's make it very simple for you.

856
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,220
When you are very alert,

857
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,770
the best situation for learning
is going to be silence.

858
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,200
It's going to be complete quiet.

859
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,110
If you are low arousal,

860
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,250
and you're tired and
you're kind of sleepy,

861
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,090
a lot of people find that
having some background chatter

862
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,280
and some background noise,
can help elevate their level

863
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,300
of autonomic arousal.

864
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,350
And that's because our auditory system

865
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,489
and our visual system, are
linked and are part of really

866
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,179
what's called the salience network.

867
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,012
Which is that we're always,

868
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:15,920
scanning our environment for things.

869
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,260
And when we have a lot of things
in our environment to scan,

870
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,739
generally our level of alertness goes up.

871
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,769
This is why environments
that are very stark

872
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,929
or have very little or
very few objects in them,

873
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,749
tend to make us feel kind of calm,

874
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,969
because our salient
network kinda shuts off.

875
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,129
A lot of people don't like that.

876
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,429
They'll go to a meditation retreat,

877
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,919
or they'll go into an environment

878
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,260
where there's very little
clutter especially city people.

879
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,120
And all of a sudden,

880
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,350
they start feeling really, really anxious.

881
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,170
And that's because their internal level

882
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,790
of autonomic arousal is really high

883
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,580
and it's not being
occupied by all this stuff

884
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,630
to pay attention to.

885
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,030
And so their salience network
starts to turn inward.

886
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,110
They move from exteroception
to interoception.

887
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,760
They're not looking outside themselves,

888
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,860
they're looking inside themselves

889
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,810
and there's a lot of noise in there.

890
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:02,960
So, as a rule of thumb,
if you tend to be kind of

891
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,580
on the high level of
alertness and kind of anxiety,

892
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,760
and I'm not talking about
clinical levels of anxiety

893
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,410
but you tend to, be pretty high energy,

894
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,600
well then, you are definitely
going to benefit more

895
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,590
in a learning bout,

896
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,907
from learning to go as well
as activate the no-go pathway.

897
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,750
And that requires a lot of energy.

898
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,350
And when you have a lot of
distractions in your environment,

899
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,640
there's a high probability
that you're gonna be distracted

900
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,060
from the learning.

901
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,390
Now, some people are
just naturally more calm.

902
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,610
They're like my bulldog
Costello, who's exceedingly calm.

903
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,610
They're pretty mellow.

904
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,500
They're kind of clear, calm
and focused all of the time.

905
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,050
And those people, actually
are gonna be less flappable.

906
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,010
They're not gonna be yanked
around by background noise

907
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,680
or they're not gonna be around, you know,

908
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,960
bothered from their learning
or from their studying

909
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,030
by a clanging of a pot from
somebody in the kitchen.

910
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,610
So, each one of us
generally tends to ride up

911
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,550
and down this autonomic
ladder, so to speak,

912
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,550
at different times a day.

913
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,960
For most people, three hours after waking.

914
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,470
Those three hours, not
three hours on the mark

915
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,810
but for that three hour
bin tends to be the period

916
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,550
in which they're most
alert throughout the day.

917
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,790
Except I'll tell you later

918
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,090
about a unique time right before sleep

919
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,410
in which you're also very,
very alert, naturally.

920
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,690
So, that morning three
hours is quite vital.

921
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,700
Now, many of you might ask about exercise

922
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,260
and when to exercise.

923
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,440
I think I may have mentioned this

924
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,870
on a previous podcast episode.

925
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,630
But, the research shows that

926
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,610
at least for performance,
afternoon exercise might be better

927
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,190
in terms of avoiding injury, et cetera.

928
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,343
But in terms of rising body temperatures,

929
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,210
and matching body temperature

930
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,640
to have mental alertness, et cetera.

931
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,030
It's pretty clear, that
exercising early in the day,

932
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,830
not only biases us
towards waking up earlier,

933
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,260
but that it also triggers
the release of things

934
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,240
like epinephrine and
other neuromodulators,

935
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,670
that lend itself,

936
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,500
to a situation where we
have heightened levels

937
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,680
of arousal and mental acuity

938
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,173
in the late morning and
even into the afternoon.

939
00:37:00,173 --> 00:37:01,860
Now, this can be very good

940
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,740
because if you wanna restrict
most of your focus learning

941
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,910
to the early part of the day,

942
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,990
exercising early in the day
does set a neurochemical context

943
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,730
or mill you for go.

944
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,680
It tends to trigger
activation of the go pathway.

945
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,440
And so for those of you like myself

946
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,320
who have a hard time kind
of engaging and getting

947
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,810
into action early in the day,

948
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,500
early morning exercise
within an hour of waking,

949
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,490
and certainly no later than
three hours after waking,

950
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,060
will give you quote unquote more energy

951
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,910
throughout the day.

952
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,270
It will make you feel
more biased for action.

953
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,870
You won't feel as lethargic.

954
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,820
So, in can kind of reviewing

955
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,550
what I've set up until now I
do the morning light thing,

956
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,570
I delay my caffeine
two hours after waking,

957
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,610
and then I generally try and get exercise

958
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,560
in the first hour or ideally

959
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,450
within the first three hours of waking up.

960
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,020
And then I'll move into
a focused learning bout.

961
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,450
Now, some of you wrote to me
and said, if I exercise early

962
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,410
in the day, then I feel
a crash afterwards.

963
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,450
If that exercise is very, very intense.

964
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,100
So you're depleting all your glycogen.

965
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,090
So you're doing heavy
deadlifts, et cetera.

966
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,740
Chances are after you eat, you
will start to feel a crash.

967
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,840
So this relates to timing of nutrition.

968
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,230
And in just as a general rule of thumb,

969
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,570
fasted states, and low
carbohydrate states,

970
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm not talking about a keto diet around

971
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,350
the clock or all week

972
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,640
but fasted states,

973
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,350
and low carbohydrate states
lend themselves to alertness.

974
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,760
And that's because carbohydrates
are rich in tryptophan,

975
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,910
and they tend to lend
themselves to sleepiness.

976
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,740
Of course, ingesting large
amounts of any kind of food,

977
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,300
any substance that fills
your gut will divert blood

978
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,133
to your gut.

979
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,950
So if you eat a lot of food regardless

980
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,810
of whether or not it's a
lot of carbohydrate or not,

981
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,300
you're going to generally
feel more sleepy.

982
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,590
Now, many people, including
everyone use food,

983
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,600
to modulate their levels
of autonomic arousal.

984
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,260
And typically eating shifts us
more towards a state of calm.

985
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,930
And fasting shifts us more
toward a state of alertness.

986
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,010
And these are hard-wired
circuits that relate

987
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,210
to the need and desire to find
food which requires action,

988
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,520
or the so-called rest and digest system

989
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,610
which diverts our resources

990
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,010
and our energy towards digestion.

991
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,360
It makes us feel calm.

992
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,880
So I personally rely on water, mate,

993
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,910
and black coffee first thing in the day,

994
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:19,210
in order to exercise and get
into the first round of work.

995
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,760
If I find that I'm too alert,

996
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,800
and then I generally will tend to eat

997
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,120
and kind of bring down
my level of alertness,

998
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,490
and will continue working.

999
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,740
Now this is in district thing.

1000
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,320
And since people asked me what I do,

1001
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,260
and I'm not dictating that people follow

1002
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,380
it exactly of course or even generally,

1003
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,610
but I'll just tell you what I do.

1004
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,940
It is possible if you're
drinking black coffee,

1005
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,270
or mate and you're
ingesting a lot of water,

1006
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,380
that you're going to
dehydrate yourself somewhat,

1007
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,600
because of excretion of sodium.

1008
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,010
Provided you don't have hypertension,

1009
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,670
salt is a really good thing.

1010
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,540
A lot of people think that they are low

1011
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,850
on blood sugar because they're
shaky and they can't think

1012
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,660
or they have a headache when
actually they're low in sodium.

1013
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,170
And especially if you're
drinking a lot of caffeine.

1014
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,680
So I'm a big believer in salt.

1015
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,621
So I drink salt water first thing

1016
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:03,960
in the morning because
I drink black coffee.

1017
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
And that keeps my levels
of alertness really good.

1018
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,260
I always thought that I
had messed up blood sugar.

1019
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,350
I had shaky hands and I
didn't know what was going on.

1020
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,560
I'd drink a little bit of
coffee and feel too amped up.

1021
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,090
And turns out that it was a sodium issue.

1022
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,220
And if I just drank water
with a little bit of sea salt

1023
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,150
and or even just a typical table salt,

1024
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,910
then I'd fell rock solid
in terms of my blood sugar.

1025
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,710
Now, again, I'm not a
physician, I'm a professor

1026
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,640
so I don't prescribe anything,
but I profess lots of things.

1027
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
So I don't want people who have diabetes

1028
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
or blood sugar issues to go off the rails.

1029
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,120
You're responsible for
your health, not me.

1030
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,370
But it's an interesting
parameter to think about

1031
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,850
and experiment with, you know,

1032
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,370
provided that your doctor says it's okay,

1033
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,480
because I think a lot of people,

1034
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,700
probably ingest too much sodium

1035
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,060
but a lot of people might be
sodium deficient in particular

1036
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,290
the people that are fasting.

1037
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,963
I typically eat my first
meal right around mid day,

1038
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,760
whether or not I've exercised or not.

1039
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,950
And the food content there

1040
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,980
is actually quite important to me.

1041
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,610
I don't know why this is.

1042
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,100
I don't have a scientific
mechanism for this

1043
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,090
but if I eat hot food for
lunch, I get sleepy after lunch.

1044
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,440
So I generally don't
eat hot food for lunch.

1045
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,260
I might have a little bit of
soup or something like that.

1046
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,870
But in general, I rely on
a low carbohydrate meal.

1047
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,100
I'll eat meat or salad
or some variation of that

1048
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,583
and nuts and fats and things like that

1049
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:23,000
because of the [indistinct]
content for focus,

1050
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,490
because the protein is good in my belief.

1051
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,510
And because I believe

1052
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,670
in eating fruits and vegetables.

1053
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,503
I do that too.

1054
00:41:28,503 --> 00:41:30,880
If I've exercised very
hard early in the day,

1055
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,710
I do ingest starches like oatmeal or rice

1056
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,860
and fruit and things like that.

1057
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,080
Now, why am I telling you all this?

1058
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,970
Because, 100s if not 1000 people ask me,

1059
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,040
is fasting good for focus?

1060
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,940
And indeed fasting will
increase alertness,

1061
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,690
but if you're so hungry
or preoccupied with food

1062
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,040
that you can't focus well,

1063
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,430
then it's not gonna be good for learning.

1064
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,110
It's only going to be good for agitation.

1065
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,070
Now, I'm just gonna mark continue to march

1066
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,490
through my day.

1067
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,300
And this is, of course what I experienced.

1068
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,780
Some people are quite different.

1069
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,550
But, what I find is
around 2:00 or 3:00 PM,

1070
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,850
I start getting a little groggy.

1071
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,590
A little bit sleepy.

1072
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:12,100
I will tend to shift my work
from work that requires a lot

1073
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,900
of duration path, outcome,
really careful analysis

1074
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,530
and activation of the no-go pathway.

1075
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,780
Meaning I'm trying to
suppress the impulse to look

1076
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,960
at my phone or answer
email, or do other things.

1077
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,830
This is why I haven't
emailed you back until 3:00

1078
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,910
in the afternoon.

1079
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,950
By the way, or responded

1080
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,400
to your text messages,
whoever you are out there.

1081
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,560
Around early afternoon,

1082
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,540
I find I can do kind of
typical more mundane tasks.

1083
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Because, those tasks
require less cognitive load.

1084
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,650
And they can be done more or
less, in and out of sequence.

1085
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,040
I can answer a couple email here,

1086
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,560
maybe answer that email there.

1087
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,040
I don't have to do it
in pure linear fashion.

1088
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,450
Any kind of linear work

1089
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,880
or learning work is gonna
take a lot of focus.

1090
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,480
And then typically around 4:00 PM or so,

1091
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,960
I do two things.

1092
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,870
Sometimes a little earlier.

1093
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:03,300
Sometimes a little later
but I do two things.

1094
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,490
One, is I make sure I hydrate.

1095
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,550
Because if you're exercising
and you're eating,

1096
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,750
you need to digest that food, et cetera.

1097
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,640
I make sure I hydrate.

1098
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,730
So I drink water.

1099
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,250
I try and refrain from drinking
coffee in the afternoon.

1100
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,460
This is a new thing for me.

1101
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,840
I sometimes do it, but I
try and refrain from that.

1102
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,890
And then I always do,

1103
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,940
a non sleep deep rest protocol
sometime in the afternoon.

1104
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,920
This is sometimes a 10 minute
yoga nidra type protocol,

1105
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,770
or a 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol.

1106
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,770
These are protocols I
have no relationship to,

1107
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,620
no business relationship to whatsoever.

1108
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,570
I've been doing them for years now.

1109
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,630
They involve listening to a script.

1110
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,010
We'll provide the links again

1111
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,580
although we've provided them before.

1112
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,000
Or I'll do a hypnosis protocol,

1113
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
from Reveri Health

1114
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,170
which is my colleague
David Spiegel's website

1115
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,490
that has these free hypnosis apps

1116
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,970
or scripts that you can listen to.

1117
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,580
And those take me into a
state of really deep rest.

1118
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,570
Sometimes so much so that I fall asleep.

1119
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,650
And I always set an alarm

1120
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,520
so that I don't sleep for
longer than 90 minutes.

1121
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,620
But typically this goes
for about 30 minutes.

1122
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,470
And I do that because for me

1123
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,790
by about 4:30 in the afternoon,

1124
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,310
I'm capable of doing basically nothing.

1125
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,770
I am just a complete Costello.

1126
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,870
I can't think, I can't do,

1127
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,340
I can't respond to email.

1128
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,490
I've just completely troughed
my ability to function.

1129
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,920
I personally find it a mistake,

1130
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,990
to that point,

1131
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,240
down a double espresso,
and charge really hard.

1132
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,350
It just doesn't work for me.

1133
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,420
I end up really disrupting
my sleep schedule.

1134
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,130
I end up disrupting a
lot of different things.

1135
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,440
So for me, I do the non
sleep deep rest protocol.

1136
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,230
It really helps me later
when I need to fall asleep.

1137
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,380
It helps with all sorts of
things, as I mentioned before.

1138
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,630
But I usually emerge
from that a little groggy

1139
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,970
or feeling like I have another
whole day, second wind.

1140
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,800
Like I could just work.

1141
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,420
And then I'll do a
second bout of learning.

1142
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,810
I'll do some sort of work

1143
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,390
that either involves linear
analysis of something.

1144
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,713
So maybe numerical work or
I'm trying to learn something.

1145
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,830
I generally try and really use those bouts

1146
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,880
of 90 minute focus energy
after the non sleep deep rest.

1147
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,520
And as I mentioned in previous episodes,

1148
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,030
there's a lot of evidence,

1149
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,510
that these non sleep deep
rest protocols can enhance

1150
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,170
and accelerate plasticity.

1151
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,870
The most I think recent

1152
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:24,700
and striking one is the study
that we referenced last time

1153
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,800
in the caption notes.

1154
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,710
It was the cell press article,

1155
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,840
Cell Reports, great journal.

1156
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,763
Was showing that these 20 minute,

1157
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,010
kinda shallow naps and
non sleep deep rests,

1158
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,570
can facilitate sensory motor learning.

1159
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:38,950
So then I'll go into another learning bout

1160
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,330
that's caffeine free.

1161
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,330
This learning bout is very
different than the morning one.

1162
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,120
This is a work bout or learning bout

1163
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,450
that's more in the clear
common focus regime

1164
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,220
because I've come out of
this non sleep deep rest.

1165
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,520
I'm not ingesting caffeine
because I wanna make sure

1166
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,010
that I can sleep later
that night really well.

1167
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,100
And, this tends to be more
when I do creative type work.

1168
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,240
Now, creativity is a topic
that we're gonna spend

1169
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
the entire month on coming up soon.

1170
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,210
But creativity is a very
interesting state of mind in which,

1171
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,970
we're taking existing elements.

1172
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,240
Things that we already know,

1173
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,990
and rearranging them
in ways that are novel.

1174
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,290
And I'd say, well, duh,
that's what creativity is.

1175
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,350
But creativity has two parts.

1176
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,600
It has a creative discovery
mode where you're kind

1177
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,760
of shuffling things around

1178
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,990
in a very relaxed way
and kind of being playful

1179
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,640
or exploring different configurations.

1180
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,930
And then creativity also has,

1181
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,890
an absolutely linear implementation mode.

1182
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:37,820
In which you take

1183
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,210
the idea or the design you've come up with

1184
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,650
and you create something
very robust and concrete.

1185
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,510
And so creativity is
really a two part thing.

1186
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,070
And the first part

1187
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,900
of actively exploring
different configuration,

1188
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,590
sometimes in a playful way,

1189
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,240
sometimes in a way that's almost random

1190
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,360
and just kind of exploring.

1191
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,370
That state is definitely facilitated

1192
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,240
by being relaxed and almost sleepy.

1193
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,260
That is not a state

1194
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,720
that I personally can access
very well early in the day.

1195
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,600
I've tried to access
it coming out of sleep

1196
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,540
because one would say,

1197
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,920
well you're still sleepy early in the day

1198
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,753
and just doesn't work.

1199
00:47:14,753 --> 00:47:15,800
Most of what I write down.

1200
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,080
Most of what I do is complete garbage.

1201
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,870
And so what I found is there's
this block in the afternoon

1202
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,580
of about 90 minutes where, I
can do creative type writing

1203
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,033
or creative type imagination of,

1204
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,770
scientific ideas or
experiments we might wanna do.

1205
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,600
Science might not seem
like a creative endeavor

1206
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,880
to many of you, but it is.

1207
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,530
Has a lot of imagining what if this,

1208
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:37,700
or we could combine that

1209
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,960
and thinking of novel concepts
or ways of arranging things.

1210
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,410
So when you find yourself in

1211
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,510
that kinda clear common focused mode,

1212
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,490
creative works tend to
come about very well

1213
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,020
in those regimes.

1214
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,720
Now I know there are a lot
of people out there rely

1215
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,123
on substances to access creative states.

1216
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,430
I'm not a marijuana user.

1217
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,030
It's just not the drug for
me, for a variety of reasons.

1218
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,490
I'm not a drinker.

1219
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,050
It's not the substance for
me for a variety of reasons.

1220
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,220
You know, I'm not a cop I'm not out here

1221
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,190
to tell people what they
should do or shouldn't do.

1222
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,780
The problem with using
substances to access creativity,

1223
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,900
is that generally the
substances that relax people,

1224
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,960
will allow them to get

1225
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,820
into that creative brainstorming mode,

1226
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,843
but not so good at the
linear implementation mode.

1227
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,440
You know, the other day I was remarking

1228
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,920
with a friend that there are
some ads, some advertisements

1229
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,900
that I've seen over the years,
that are just incredible.

1230
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,820
I'll just tell you what they are.

1231
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,930
So there's not cryptic or anything.

1232
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,989
I'm revealing my tastes here.

1233
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:42,350
There's a particular perfume
ad that Spike Jones made

1234
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,100
that is just amazing.

1235
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,823
I'll put a link to it
cause it's just so cool.

1236
00:48:49,412 --> 00:48:50,245
I don't want to give away the end

1237
00:48:50,245 --> 00:48:52,163
but it has a feature of it that
is particularly interesting

1238
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,931
to me as a neuroscientist.

1239
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,360
And it's just so cool.

1240
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,770
'Cause I grew up in the
skateboarding thing,

1241
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,800
I knew a little bit about
Spike's movies and skateboarding

1242
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,280
and he's of course made
a lot of very impressive,

1243
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,230
popular movies as well,
full length features.

1244
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,900
I don't know him personally,
so this isn't a plug.

1245
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,390
Not that he needs my
endorsement for anything at all.

1246
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:14,800
But the amazing thing
about this advertisement

1247
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,330
is it's a collection of things

1248
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,920
that you would never really
think would be combined,

1249
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,460
and it involves different speeds

1250
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,630
of motion and all sorts of effects.

1251
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,920
I mean, it's like a real classic

1252
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,000
like Spike Jones kind delivery.

1253
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,270
But, what's incredible is when you think

1254
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,890
about not just the fact that
someone had to imagine that

1255
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,100
but to actually implement the
steps in order to create that,

1256
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,830
when you see this you'll
realize that was a ton of work.

1257
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,550
You can't just put that together randomly.

1258
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:45,440
And so a lot of people, not Spike clearly,

1259
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,440
but a lot of people who have
an incredible mind for ideas

1260
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,480
and novel arrangements of things,

1261
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,060
they are great at accessing
that state but not so good

1262
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,053
at accessing the implementation state.

1263
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,940
It's also true that a lot of people

1264
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,430
and some who tend to fall on
what we would call the kind of

1265
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,790
like more Asperger's or
autism end of the spectrum,

1266
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,180
are very good at linear implementation.

1267
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,240
Now I'm not talking about all
forms of autism of course.

1268
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,270
I'm sensitive to the fact

1269
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,300
that there are many forms on the spectrum.

1270
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,770
But, some people are very
good at linear implementation.

1271
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:22,220
And that's, a separate
state from a creative state.

1272
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,630
So, that afternoon block is when I try

1273
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,020
and access the freer
kind of looser mindset

1274
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,030
that's associated with the
fatigue that comes later

1275
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,043
in the afternoon.

1276
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:34,930
And, for some of you that state

1277
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,340
that favors creativity
and creative learning,

1278
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,080
might be better in the morning.

1279
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,913
I don't know.

1280
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:40,746
You're gonna have to decide.

1281
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,750
For some of you you're
gonna be late shifted.

1282
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,380
Some of you are gonna be morning shifted.

1283
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,780
But where we have alertness,

1284
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,900
generally we are good at
linear implementation,

1285
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,190
we're good at activating the no-go pathway

1286
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,280
and suppressing action,

1287
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,688
and we are good at
pursuing particular goals

1288
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:56,860
and strategy implementation.

1289
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,010
And where we tend to be more relaxed,

1290
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,120
and we tend to be almost
in a kind of sleepy mode.

1291
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,953
So for me, coming out

1292
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:04,850
of one of these non sleep,
deep rest modes or sleep,

1293
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:08,740
that's when we tend to be
better at novel configurations

1294
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,180
of existing elements, which is creativity.

1295
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,290
And this brings about a question
that I get, all the time.

1296
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,260
Which is, what about psychedelics?

1297
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,530
So, I am going to talk, to
some experts on psychedelics.

1298
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,530
I hope to bring some of them in.

1299
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,170
Actually speaking on people coming in

1300
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,493
or creatures coming.

1301
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,230
A creature that's definitely
not on psychedelics

1302
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,260
who doesn't need any is
Costello and he just arrived.

1303
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,790
He seems to be in a sleepy
state most, all the time.

1304
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,780
Hey buddy, how you doing?

1305
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,680
You come in, yep.

1306
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,260
He's working on his 15th sleep
deep rest episode of the day

1307
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,350
which is generally followed

1308
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,620
by a 10 to 12 hour deep rest episode,

1309
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,390
almost exclusively comprised of REM.

1310
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,970
And I know this 'cause his eyes are open

1311
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:54,790
'cause they're so droopy, he
can't close them all the way

1312
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,430
and his eyes are going like this.

1313
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,160
And he's going down for the count.

1314
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,610
So, yeah, nice and big yawn.

1315
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:04,550
Okay so, psychedelics.

1316
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,290
First of all, I wanna be very clear.

1317
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,680
I am neither a proponent,
nor am I somebody

1318
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,230
who rejects the potential
role of psychedelics.

1319
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,940
I do however, think that psychedelics,

1320
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,180
can be particularly hazardous,

1321
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,290
for people who have preexisting
psychological issues,

1322
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,360
and are not working
with a board certified,

1323
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,160
psychiatrist or physician,

1324
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,720
as well as for essentially all kids.

1325
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,070
I think that the young brain is basically

1326
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,793
in its own psychedelic
state and just naturally.

1327
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,560
And all kidding aside,

1328
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,940
I think that the young brain

1329
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,970
is so subject to neuroplasticity,

1330
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:45,910
that drugs, which like psychedelics
which are very powerful,

1331
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,290
can be detrimental to
the developing brain.

1332
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,340
That's just my stance.

1333
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,890
If anyone disagrees with me,
I'd be happy to chat with you

1334
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,510
about it in a polite and discourse.

1335
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,540
I'll be happy to listen as well

1336
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,683
as tell you more why I believe
that based on the data.

1337
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,800
I'm mentioning psychedelics
because many of you asked.

1338
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,970
Here's the deal with psychedelics.

1339
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,850
At least here's how they work.

1340
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,450
In a nutshell, psychedelics were thought

1341
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,600
to unleash sensory processing
and to make it less filtered.

1342
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,330
We have a lot of different
inputs from our eyes,

1343
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,220
from our ears, from our nose,
from our taste, et cetera

1344
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,180
that you're coming in
all the time in parallel.

1345
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,670
And we have mechanisms that
suppress some of and allow us

1346
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,320
to only focus on things
that are happening.

1347
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,370
Visually, generally we don't
have synesthesia unless some

1348
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,080
of us happen to have synesthesia.

1349
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,630
We don't blend what we see
with what we hear in a way,

1350
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,320
that is confusing to us.

1351
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,100
We know what's making sounds and we know

1352
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,690
what is a visual stimulus.

1353
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,250
On psychedelics, people report
being able to smell colors

1354
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,850
or to, you know, hear trees, et cetera.

1355
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,920
And that's because there's
a lot of sensory blending.

1356
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,490
Over that's led to the misconception,

1357
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:58,120
that sensory blending itself,
is a creative process.

1358
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,620
There's nothing creative
about sensory blending.

1359
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,620
You know there's, the essence
of a creative process,

1360
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,000
is that some novel
configuration of elements,

1361
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,070
whether or not it's notes on a piano,

1362
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,440
or whether or not it's words on a page,

1363
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,610
whether or not it's numbers

1364
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,070
or whether or not it's movement.

1365
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:20,070
That some way in which those
are configured in some new way,

1366
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,180
that the algorithm, the way in which,

1367
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,310
they are configured makes
sense to the observer.

1368
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,550
And this is a key thing.

1369
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,383
It seems to me

1370
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:31,820
that when people report their
psychedelic experiences,

1371
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,870
it makes a lot more sense

1372
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,910
to the person who experiences
it, than to the observer.

1373
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:40,910
And so, creative works by
definition are new ways

1374
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,670
of configuring things that lend themselves

1375
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,970
to a bigger or greater or
deeper or novel understanding

1376
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,870
on the part of the observer.

1377
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,920
And just sensory blending is
not gonna accomplish that.

1378
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,990
Now it is true and there's a great review

1379
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,930
in the journal cell, excellent journal

1380
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,360
about how psychedelics work.

1381
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,970
And it turns out, they don't just work,

1382
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:03,880
by allowing for more sensory blending.

1383
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,830
They do, because of the way

1384
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,450
that they activate certain
serotonin receptors et cetera.

1385
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,680
They do lend themselves to
more lateral connectivity

1386
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,950
between different brain areas,
more novel associations.

1387
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,880
So in principle,

1388
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,810
in principle, I should say
not necessarily in practice,

1389
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,300
but in principle, they
do allow different areas

1390
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,133
of the brain.

1391
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:23,966
Maybe even the two sides

1392
00:55:23,966 --> 00:55:25,870
of the brain to communicate more broadly

1393
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,690
than they would normally.

1394
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,890
So that has certain elements
that speak to creativity.

1395
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,980
But, it can't simply be the case

1396
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,530
that psychedelics are
the portal to creativity.

1397
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:39,790
Because creativity, as I mentioned before,

1398
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,840
involves not just novel
associations and a breaking of kind

1399
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,430
of space-time rules, it also
involves reconfiguring things,

1400
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:52,120
such that the new space-time
rule that one comes up with,

1401
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,410
is interesting, stimulating

1402
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:58,130
and kind of in many cases,
delightful to the observer.

1403
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,450
And that's why, many
claims that, you know,

1404
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:06,290
psychedelics open plasticity
or they increase creativity.

1405
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,700
That's not sufficient for me personally.

1406
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,760
I'm curious about,

1407
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,080
does it not just open the
creative thinking process,

1408
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,680
this novel configuration process?

1409
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,190
But does it also,

1410
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,070
lend itself to the
implementation of creative works?

1411
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,270
And the answer is, no.

1412
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,850
In most cases it has nothing to do

1413
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,640
with creative implementation.

1414
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,240
Now, I think that, there may come a time

1415
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,550
and certainly there are clinical trials

1416
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,620
that are happening now,

1417
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,960
where psychedelics are leveraged

1418
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
toward particular clinical goals.

1419
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,390
And I wanna tip my hat

1420
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,980
to the work at Johns Hopkins
that's happening now,

1421
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,423
which really lends itself,

1422
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,497
to the idea that early preliminary data

1423
00:56:43,497 --> 00:56:44,570
and some of the papers

1424
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,530
that are coming out
they're really fantastic.

1425
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:50,540
Showing that there may
be some excellent roles

1426
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,210
for certain psychedelics in
certain clinical context.

1427
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,850
These are clinical studies done
with a psychiatrist present,

1428
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,440
that is authorized to do that.

1429
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,040
That can help people through
depression, trauma, et cetera.

1430
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,910
And we're gonna spend a lot

1431
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,320
of time talking about
that, including with some

1432
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,410
of those folks running those studies.

1433
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:07,920
So we can look forward to that.

1434
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,050
So all of this is to say that,

1435
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,430
no I don't take psychedelics
to access creative states.

1436
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,600
That's not where I think the
major role, the important role

1437
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,770
of psychedelics might show up
if it's going to for humanity.

1438
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,510
I think that it may have
these important roles

1439
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:24,810
in the clinical context.

1440
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,420
Provided it's done legally and safely.

1441
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,955
I think that,

1442
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:33,220
the creative process being a
two-stage process means that,

1443
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,940
I am personally best served

1444
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:39,480
by having this period of
non-linear exploration of concepts.

1445
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,690
Whatever it is I happen to be
working on in the afternoon.

1446
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,000
But then I'll actually shelve that work.

1447
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,170
I'll just set it aside and then
I'll revisit it the next day

1448
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,490
or even the next day,

1449
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:53,560
to see whether or not that
the work itself is ready

1450
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,590
for deliberate linear implementation

1451
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:56,670
which I would wanna do during one

1452
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,530
of these highly focused states.

1453
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,660
So, the long and short way
of saying this is that,

1454
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,660
when we're very alert, do
linear type of operations.

1455
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,390
When we tend to be more
sleepy and more relaxed,

1456
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:11,160
that's when creative works
can first be conceived,

1457
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,460
but their implementation requires
high levels of alertness.

1458
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,350
Now, that gets us more

1459
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,350
to the kind of late afternoon evening.

1460
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,410
Now I am, as I mentioned before,

1461
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:26,120
I'm a proponent of getting
sunlight in the evening as well.

1462
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:30,460
This is a critical thing that
I have not mentioned before.

1463
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,180
Here's how it works.

1464
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,560
Many people now have heard
me say getting light early

1465
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,930
in the day is important.

1466
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,720
But that will advance one's clock.

1467
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,560
It'll make you wanna get
up earlier the next day.

1468
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,050
By getting light in the evening

1469
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,640
it accomplishes two things for me.

1470
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,430
First of all, it makes sure
that I don't get up too early

1471
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,450
that I'm not waking up at
3:00 or 4:00 in the morning

1472
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,160
because it's going to shift my clock.

1473
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,900
It's going to delay it a little bit.

1474
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,910
And so this is really important.

1475
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,830
If you want to keep your
schedule on a normal routine,

1476
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,350
on a regular 24 hour cycle

1477
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,870
and not have your circadian rhythms

1478
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,980
of sleep and wakefulness
drifting all over the place

1479
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,300
and you want some predictability

1480
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,800
to how your mind is going to work

1481
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,070
in order to optimize
learning and performance.

1482
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,330
Well, then you need to get
morning light any evening light.

1483
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,170
The morning light is
going to advance my clock.

1484
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,910
Make my system wanna get up earlier.

1485
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,450
And the evening light is going

1486
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,680
to delay my clock a little
bit so that on average

1487
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,120
it kind of bookends my
circadian mechanisms.

1488
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,300
And I'll basically wanna go to sleep

1489
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,980
at more or less the same
time each night and wake up,

1490
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,230
more or less at the
same time each morning.

1491
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,440
That's how it works.

1492
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,040
And that's a hard wired mechanism.

1493
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,540
That's not some subjective
thing that I tell myself.

1494
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,750
That's a hardwired mechanism.

1495
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,140
So, that gets us to the evening.

1496
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,080
And generally in the
evening I'll get that light

1497
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,070
by going outside

1498
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:45,010
or sometimes I'll do it

1499
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,140
by turning up artificial lights brightly,

1500
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,020
and then I'll start to
dim them for the evening

1501
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,580
'cause as I've mentioned many times before

1502
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,190
and I'm not gonna belabor the point.

1503
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,410
You wanna minimize your light exposure,

1504
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,330
especially overhead bright light exposure,

1505
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,610
regardless of whether or
not it's blue light or not.

1506
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,140
In the evening from about
10:00 PM to 4:00 AM.

1507
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,380
Some of you asked,

1508
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,600
wait I thought it was 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM?

1509
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,870
Well, it is, but 10:00 PM
to 4:00 AM is even better.

1510
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:12,000
It's just that when I originally
said 10:00 PM to 4:00 AM,

1511
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,280
people were like that it's impossible

1512
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,630
for most people to adhere to.

1513
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,640
So for me, it screens off,

1514
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,070
it's dim lights, and that's
what favors falling asleep

1515
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,220
in a good night's sleep for me.

1516
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,690
Since we were talking about food earlier,

1517
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,220
I'll just revisit a little
bit of what I said before.

1518
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,820
My evening meal tends to be
more carbohydrate rich more.

1519
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,030
If I have proteins,
there'll be like eggs, fish

1520
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,630
or chicken or something of
that sort or no protein.

1521
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,790
And I eat high carbohydrates.

1522
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,155
So I'm not one of these people that's keto

1523
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:43,170
or high meat only, or anything like that.

1524
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,080
Remember, fasting and low carbohydrate,

1525
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,560
states facilitate alertness.

1526
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,480
Carbohydrate rich foods,
facilitate calmness and sleepiness.

1527
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,520
They'd stimulate the release

1528
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,180
of tryptophan and the transition to sleep.

1529
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,590
So that's why I do them late in the day.

1530
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:59,340
Also, if you've exercised
early in the day,

1531
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,110
especially if it's weight bearing exercise

1532
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,710
or everything's weight bearing exercises.

1533
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,965
I suppose unless you're an astronaut.

1534
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:05,798
And you're in space.

1535
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:08,450
But if you're early in the
day, exercising with weights

1536
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,382
or you're doing a long run,

1537
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:12,800
sooner or later, you need
to replenish glycogen.

1538
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,940
And, I realized

1539
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,730
that the ketonisters
out there are gonna say,

1540
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,420
well, you know,
gluconeogenesis will allow you

1541
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,250
to replenish glycogen, et cetera.

1542
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:24,180
I'm just gonna call out the lie right now,

1543
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,410
because I feel like doing it.

1544
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,870
And 'cause I think it
just hasn't been stated.

1545
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:31,620
Which is that, not everybody, but a lot

1546
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,060
of the people that are proponents

1547
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,840
of high meat keto diets, fine.

1548
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,360
That's fine if that's what they wanna do.

1549
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,010
And as you recall, I do
relatively ketogenic diet

1550
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,120
during the day, for alertness or fasting.

1551
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,320
But a lot of those people,

1552
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,370
can replenish glycogen really well

1553
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:53,450
without ingesting carbohydrates,
so-called gluconeogenesis

1554
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,610
and enhance protein synthesis.

1555
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,583
Because they are hormone enhanced.

1556
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,870
I've been around a while.

1557
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:01,990
I know what this looks like.

1558
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,390
They're either thyroid enhanced

1559
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,170
or hormone enhanced and I
don't pass any judgment.

1560
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,690
But when you look at
people who look amazing

1561
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,570
on keto and are able to have a lot

1562
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,680
of energy and replenish
their glycogen on keto,

1563
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,460
they are in many cases, not all,

1564
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,360
but in many cases
they're hormone enhanced.

1565
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,430
They're taking exogenous hormones,

1566
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:25,350
that allow them to synthesize,

1567
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,390
and repair muscle in ways that people

1568
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,560
who aren't taking those
exogenous hormones can't.

1569
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,500
This is not just true
of the men by the way.

1570
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,800
This is also true of the women.

1571
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,850
And this is a whole discussion

1572
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,090
into itself probably not directly related

1573
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,710
to this month of the podcast.

1574
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,930
So, I don't mind that people do this,

1575
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,110
but one problem

1576
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:45,090
is when people are following
ketogenic diets all the way

1577
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,380
through to sleep and they have trouble

1578
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,810
with sleep or they're doing long bouts

1579
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,833
of fasting and they're having
trouble falling asleep.

1580
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:50,830
That makes sense.

1581
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,930
It's because their
autonomic arousal is tilted

1582
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,890
towards epinephrine release,

1583
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:57,230
norepinephrine release,
and dopamine release.

1584
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,250
So they have a lot of energy

1585
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,650
but they have a hard time calming down

1586
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,460
and getting into deep sleep.

1587
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,230
I tend to achieve that
state using carbohydrates

1588
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,390
and it also replenishes glycogen.

1589
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,000
So again, you know, I'm not
trying to draw any fire,

1590
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,560
but if I do, I'd be happy
to have a conversation,

1591
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,000
about all that.

1592
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,053
Again, no judgment, but I think

1593
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:17,720
that most people out there are not aware

1594
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,440
of some of the other variables.

1595
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,790
Remember, good science is
about isolating variables.

1596
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,680
And so oftentimes what we're
seeing in social media,

1597
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,050
is we're getting
presented single variables

1598
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,600
and we're not seeing the full context

1599
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,160
of the other variables
that are being manipulated.

1600
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,710
So, I eat pasta and rice

1601
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,380
and vegetables and things
like that in the evening.

1602
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,170
Also, I just find, maybe I'm becoming one

1603
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:40,000
of the last people that does that.

1604
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,833
Although I hope not.

1605
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,930
I hope there are others out there like me.

1606
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,130
From all the literature speaks to the fact

1607
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,060
that carbohydrates not only do that,

1608
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,100
but they also help maintain,

1609
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,090
healthy thyroid function, et cetera.

1610
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,170
So that's my bias.

1611
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,003
That's what I do.

1612
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:55,790
I do avoid caffeine and
whatnot in the evening.

1613
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,720
I do take supplements and I'll be happy

1614
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,350
at some point to put out the complete list

1615
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:01,980
of supplements that I take out there.

1616
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,200
But in general, these are
the core things that I do.

1617
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,769
And they relate to a lot of the questions

1618
01:04:06,769 --> 01:04:09,230
that you've been asking over time.

1619
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,020
The next piece of scientific
data that I'm gonna describe

1620
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,560
is a very important
piece of scientific data,

1621
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,820
for sake of understanding
how to optimize your brain

1622
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,940
and access sleep.

1623
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,270
It also can help avoid
a lot of anxiety issues.

1624
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:26,290
And these relate to data from
Charles Czeisler, doctor.

1625
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:29,370
He's an MD Charles Czeisler's
lab at Harvard Medical School.

1626
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,460
He's run a sleep lab out
of Harvard Medical School.

1627
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,150
For a long time now it
has very impressive work.

1628
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,890
And what he's shown is
that the peak output,

1629
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:40,540
of the circadian clock for wakefulness,

1630
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,650
in other words the peak
of our wakefulness,

1631
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,960
and the suppression of the sleep signal,

1632
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,150
actually happens very late in the day.

1633
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:52,400
So we have this trough of activity

1634
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,500
and body temperatures
lowest right before waking.

1635
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,770
Then as we wake up our
body temperature goes up

1636
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,650
and into the afternoon

1637
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,560
it continues to go up
and then it tends to fall

1638
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,990
in the evening and towards bedtime.

1639
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:08,790
But there's a brief blip,
of release of peptides

1640
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:13,070
and other substances from the
sleep centers in the brain,

1641
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,610
and the suprachiasmatic nucleus

1642
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,570
that the sleep center
is this preoptic area,

1643
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:19,130
that if you wanna look that up.

1644
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,560
This preoptic area not far
from the circadian clock

1645
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,120
that signals the peak of alertness

1646
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,000
and wakefulness about
an hour, before bedtime.

1647
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,380
And he say, whoa, that's really weird.

1648
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,910
But a lot of people get into bed.

1649
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:32,720
They're ready to go to sleep
and they're wide awake.

1650
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,300
And they think this is an unnatural thing

1651
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,300
or there's something wrong with them.

1652
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,820
And actually it's not.

1653
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,370
This it's believed,

1654
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,940
I don't know, again, I wasn't
consulted at the design phase.

1655
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:47,350
But it's believed, is a
signal that is helpful

1656
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,370
to human beings to start
gathering up resources

1657
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,760
and securing themselves

1658
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,730
for a night's sleep
during which we, you know,

1659
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,910
historically were very
vulnerable to attack

1660
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,930
from other humans and
from animals and so forth.

1661
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,180
And so that desire to run
around and clean the kitchen

1662
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,180
or organize things, or
just a general feeling

1663
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,910
of internal anxiety, late in the evening,

1664
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,990
that's a natural blip
that naturally passes

1665
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:12,400
after about 45 to 60 minutes.

1666
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,290
Now that's often the time
when people start stressing

1667
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,160
about the fact that they have
something to do the next day

1668
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,487
and they worry about
not being able to sleep

1669
01:06:18,487 --> 01:06:20,850
and it can cascade into
a whole set of things.

1670
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:24,740
So another thing that I do
throughout my day is I know

1671
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,280
that early day I'm gonna be alert,

1672
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,920
afternoon I'm gonna be kinda sleepy.

1673
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,160
And then as the evening comes around,

1674
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,540
in addition to doing all
the other things I'm doing,

1675
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:37,290
I anticipate, a peak in
alertness in activity.

1676
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,880
And I don't worry about it.

1677
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,120
I use that perhaps to get
organized for the next day

1678
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,030
but basically, I just go through,

1679
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,290
if I'm gonna do anything, it's
gonna be very mundane task

1680
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:48,580
like cleaning or things that
require almost zero effort.

1681
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,730
And that probably speaks to
my cleaning abilities too.

1682
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,960
But, the fact

1683
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,730
of the matter is we don't
just go drift off into sleep.

1684
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,720
There's this blip of
alertness right before sleep

1685
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,390
that I hope just cognitively knowing

1686
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,420
about will be helpful to people.

1687
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:05,030
And that raises, yet another theme

1688
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:07,330
that I think is going
to be very important.

1689
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:11,580
Which is, physiological mechanisms.

1690
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,790
Like these changes in alertness.

1691
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:15,480
Or using breathing tools.

1692
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,310
Something we'll talk
about in future episodes

1693
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:20,500
to shift our levels of autonomic arousal.

1694
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,280
Those are concrete, biological phenomenon.

1695
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,570
So is fasting.

1696
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,050
Fasting will increase alertness that way.

1697
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:28,320
So is caffeine.

1698
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,550
Not everybody's susceptible

1699
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,300
to caffeine to the same degree of others

1700
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,400
But, it's a physiological mechanisms.

1701
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,250
We know the receptors.

1702
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,800
We know the ligands as they're called

1703
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,210
which bind to the receptors.

1704
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:38,410
We know the mechanisms.

1705
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:40,950
They involve cortisol and epinephrine.

1706
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,180
Those are the sorts of things

1707
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:44,430
that I personally try and leverage,

1708
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:47,360
toward my learning and
optimization of my brain,

1709
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,870
and my activity.

1710
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:51,610
Doing physical activity early
in the day for instance,

1711
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,670
tends to give us a longer duration,

1712
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:54,520
wake up signal,

1713
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,200
intends to accelerate
waking up early in the day.

1714
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,370
That's why working out late
in the day can sometimes

1715
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,790
cause people to have
trouble falling asleep.

1716
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,000
It will also phase delay.

1717
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,500
You make it so that you wanna
wake up later the next day.

1718
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,550
It's not just 'cause you're tired.

1719
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,730
It's 'cause you shifted your clock

1720
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,230
with activity and temperature.

1721
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,250
Many people ask me about
subjective tools for plasticity.

1722
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,529
What about visualization?

1723
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:19,749
Can we just imagine doing
a particular activity,

1724
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,529
will that help us get
better at that activity?

1725
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:24,439
There's some evidence

1726
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:26,982
that visualization can do that, it's true.

1727
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,270
But here's the important distinction.

1728
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:31,410
And here's why I personally,

1729
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,939
don't do much, deliberate visualization.

1730
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:37,859
First of all, I get my best ability,

1731
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,159
or achieve my best ability
to visualize things when I'm

1732
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,569
in kind of a sleepy state.

1733
01:08:41,569 --> 01:08:42,402
I don't know why

1734
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:44,910
but that's when I'm
able to, direct my brain

1735
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:47,550
towards internal visualization
with my eyes closed.

1736
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,090
And generally I fall asleep

1737
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,090
and I can't remember anything

1738
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:51,720
that I was thinking about before.

1739
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,880
Some people, and these are work
that was done many years ago

1740
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,910
by Roger Shephard and by others.

1741
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,529
Roger was at Stanford but

1742
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:00,719
and other labs have done
this too, of course,

1743
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,700
of rotating objects
physically in their mind,

1744
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:07,220
as a way of improving
or looking at the speed

1745
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,763
of spatial calculations and so forth.

1746
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:14,029
Some people are very
good at visualization.

1747
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:16,029
They can close their eyes
and they can just see objects

1748
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:17,949
and rotate them deliberately, et cetera.

1749
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,540
A lot of people like me,
when we start doing that,

1750
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,490
our mind drifts too easily.

1751
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:25,970
But I like to think I'm a
reasonably focused person

1752
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:28,630
in the waking state.

1753
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,660
So, visualization it's interesting

1754
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,180
'cause I think people are
very attracted to the idea,

1755
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,013
that they can just think

1756
01:09:35,013 --> 01:09:37,109
about something and then
get better at it that way.

1757
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:41,099
And it's probably true,
if you can be very linear

1758
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,680
in the way that you visualize things.

1759
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,513
So I wanna repeat that.

1760
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,069
I think visualization
does have certain power.

1761
01:09:47,069 --> 01:09:49,119
If you can remain very linear

1762
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,470
and deliberate and focused,
in the visualization.

1763
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:55,230
But many people like
myself who are challenged,

1764
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:59,360
with maintaining that linear
focus with eyes closed,

1765
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,110
and in visualization,

1766
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:03,490
they don't get much out of visualization.

1767
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,560
And I think the data on
performance really supports that.

1768
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,030
Now there are examples where for instance,

1769
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,530
people will injure one limb

1770
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:13,790
and then they will
exercise the intact limb,

1771
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,630
or the non-injured limb rather.

1772
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,770
And they will visualize the opposite limb.

1773
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:19,660
Sometimes there's even
the use of mirror boxes.

1774
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,030
So that let's say my left limb is injured.

1775
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,150
I'm maintaining activity
with my right limb

1776
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,240
but I'm using a mirror box

1777
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,530
so it looks like my left
limb is working well.

1778
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:29,800
Yes, there's some top-down

1779
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,710
or feedback mechanisms,
that support the idea that

1780
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:37,010
the injured limb can rehabilitate
more quickly, et cetera.

1781
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,883
But, those are fairly elaborate schemes.

1782
01:10:40,797 --> 01:10:42,550
I don't want a mirror
boxes around my house.

1783
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:45,920
I think these are
specialized circumstances.

1784
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,940
They're a little bit like
the examples that we see

1785
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,300
in the news where, oh,
so-and-so has a stroke

1786
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,593
and then spontaneously
speaks a new language.

1787
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:57,540
I don't know what the answer to that is.

1788
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,230
It shows that the brain
has associative networks

1789
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:03,010
that are typically suppressed
and those can be unleashed.

1790
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,260
But you certainly don't wanna go out

1791
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,860
and give yourself a
stroke deliberately to try

1792
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,990
and unmask some skill,

1793
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:11,910
because there's no concrete
way to go about that

1794
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,200
in a way that you could really know

1795
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,060
that you were gonna offset

1796
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,410
the detrimental effects of the stroke.

1797
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,350
In fact, I think it'd be a terrible idea.

1798
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:22,370
So I think what I'm trying
to describe is how a typical,

1799
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,360
I don't know if I'm typical or normal.

1800
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,080
I mean, I've been told otherwise,
and certainly not normal.

1801
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,930
But in terms of the way
that I structure my day,

1802
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:32,690
I think that's normal.

1803
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:33,700
That's pretty normal.

1804
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,830
I tend to wake up right
around, I don't know,

1805
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,050
somewhere between 5:30 and 7:00 AM,

1806
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,530
depending on what I've been
doing the night before.

1807
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,800
I tend to go to sleep
somewhere around 10:30, 11:00.

1808
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,080
I tend to have one bout

1809
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,930
in the morning where I can
do really focused hard work

1810
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,970
and I can really activate the go pathway

1811
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,290
while also activating the no-go pathway

1812
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,720
so that I can really stay focused.

1813
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,170
But I rely on some tools.

1814
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,003
I have a period

1815
01:11:55,003 --> 01:11:57,200
in the afternoon where I get
sleepy and kinda out of it

1816
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,550
like I think most people.

1817
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:02,670
And I tend to come out of that
recognizing the opportunity

1818
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,320
of that slightly sleepy
state for creative work

1819
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,950
and for thinking about
things in novel ways.

1820
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,750
I get light a couple of times a day.

1821
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,250
I eat low carb during the day,

1822
01:12:12,331 --> 01:12:13,410
and I don't say high, but you know,

1823
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,700
higher carbs I eat
starches, in the evening.

1824
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,210
So in a way I can sleep.

1825
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,950
And then, I really anticipate

1826
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:24,730
that late afternoon peak and alertness.

1827
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:27,310
Excuse me, late night peak and alertness

1828
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:30,480
that many people confuse for insomnia

1829
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,780
or challenges when actually
they're really quite normal

1830
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,630
in their circadian cycle.

1831
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:37,930
And then I fall asleep.

1832
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,750
And if all goes well,

1833
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,060
I stay asleep for four or five hours.

1834
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,330
Typically it's three or
four and then I wake up.

1835
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,940
I think I'm like most people I wake up

1836
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,180
during the middle of the night.

1837
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,540
Now, one thing that I don't
think has been discussed a lot

1838
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,980
but one of my colleagues

1839
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,260
at the Stanford sleep
lab tells me is that,

1840
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:56,150
every hour and a half
or so, we all wake up.

1841
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:58,330
Some of you even look
around, believe it or not

1842
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,860
and go right back to sleep.

1843
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,210
And you don't recognize it.

1844
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:04,200
Waking up periodically
during sleep is the norm.

1845
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,250
It is not abnormal.

1846
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,083
I don't know

1847
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,400
why this hasn't been
discussed more prominently.

1848
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,100
I tend to wake up and if
there's a bright light coming

1849
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,230
through the blinds, or if
there's some noise upstairs,

1850
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:16,290
if Costello's snoring particularly loud,

1851
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:19,510
I might get up, I might,
go use the restroom.

1852
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:21,970
I might, you know,

1853
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,170
pick up a book and read
under low light or something

1854
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:27,090
and then I generally fall
back asleep and wake up,

1855
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:30,690
typical time for me again,
5:30 or 7:00 AM in the morning.

1856
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,650
This waking up in the
middle of the night thing

1857
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:33,710
as I mentioned at the beginning

1858
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,080
of the podcast episode today,
is not necessarily abnormal.

1859
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,320
What it probably reflects,

1860
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,230
is that the real time meaning,
the time that I should go

1861
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,270
to sleep is probably
closer to eight o'clock.

1862
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:48,600
The word midnight was literally
supposed to mean mid night.

1863
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,230
We, many meaning all
of us were meant to go

1864
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:54,130
to sleep and wake up
with the rise, you know,

1865
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,400
with the setting and rising of the sun.

1866
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,400
And we know this because
this beautiful study

1867
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,670
from University of Colorado,
where they took people out

1868
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:05,270
into the wilderness to reset
their circadian clocks,

1869
01:14:07,597 --> 01:14:09,553
measured by way of melatonin and cortisol.

1870
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:12,790
They were completely out
of whack from interacting

1871
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,430
with screens and staying
up too late, et cetera.

1872
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:16,820
And they basically had
them view the sunrise

1873
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,780
and view the sunset each
evening and almost all of them

1874
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,160
not all of those
students, but all of them,

1875
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,390
got onto a schedule where
they naturally wanted

1876
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:27,620
to go to sleep at sunset
and wake up around sunrise

1877
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,020
or just before sunrise, even
when they were brought back

1878
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,120
into a normal artificial light setting.

1879
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,750
So I think that's the natural pattern

1880
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,210
and we've just deviated from
it with artificial lights.

1881
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,570
So waking up at 3:00 AM or 4:00
AM doesn't necessarily mean

1882
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:43,286
that there's something
screwed up about you.

1883
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:47,370
Or that you have anxiety or
something, although you might.

1884
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:48,500
What it likely means is

1885
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,300
that you were supposed to
go to bed much earlier.

1886
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,770
And because of this asymmetry

1887
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:54,440
in the autonomic nervous
system where it's much easier

1888
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,760
for us to push, and to
delay our sleep time

1889
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,083
than it is to accelerate our wake-up time.

1890
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,070
In other words, it's easier to stay up

1891
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,350
and hang out at the party even

1892
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:06,290
if you don't wanna be
there than it is to wake up

1893
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,390
when you're exhausted and your fast sleep.

1894
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,950
Most people are pushing
through, into the late hours

1895
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:14,030
of the evening and night and going

1896
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:16,630
to bed much later than they
naturally would want to.

1897
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,410
And so I personally don't
want to go to bed at 8:00 PM.

1898
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:24,220
A lot of good things happen
between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM.

1899
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,920
And so, I wanna enjoy those.

1900
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,390
And I push through the evening hours.

1901
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,210
But as a consequence, I'm
running out of melatonin.

1902
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,160
My melatonin release is basically subsided

1903
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,240
by about 3:00 or 4:00 AM

1904
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,300
and so it makes sense
that I would wake up.

1905
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,230
I don't take melatonin
for reasons discussed

1906
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:41,170
in previous episodes.

1907
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:44,230
I do rely on things
like magnesium glycinate

1908
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:47,178
or magnesium threonate,
things like theanine.

1909
01:15:47,178 --> 01:15:48,900
I'm not saying any of
you need to take those.

1910
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,210
That's just what I happened to take

1911
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,740
in order to facilitate my sleep.

1912
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,793
And it's been of great benefit to me.

1913
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,190
If I wake up in the middle of the night

1914
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:59,060
and I'm anxious for whatever
reason or my mind is looping,

1915
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,360
I have a couple of rules.

1916
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,930
One is, I don't trust
anything I think about.

1917
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,890
When I wake up in the middle
of the night, any of it.

1918
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,300
Unless I've had a magnificent dream

1919
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,350
and I wanna write it down,

1920
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,960
I'll do that every once in a while.

1921
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,270
Typically when I go back and read it,

1922
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,183
it's not at all magnificent.

1923
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:16,230
I can't ever remember coming up

1924
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,330
with anything really fantastic in one

1925
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:22,040
of my dreams that stuck with
me, or that I implemented.

1926
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,100
I don't really trust the
kind of thinking that happens

1927
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,100
in those wee hours of the
circadian cycle for me.

1928
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,450
There's just nothing either
for me terribly creative,

1929
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:33,460
or worth linear
implementation at that time.

1930
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,530
But, one thing that has been very helpful

1931
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:36,860
is to sometimes do one

1932
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:39,010
of these non sleep deep rest protocols

1933
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:41,010
as a way to go back into sleep.

1934
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,770
So a hypnosis app or some

1935
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,340
of the scripts by Michael Sealey
that I've mentioned before,

1936
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:50,440
or the Reveri Health, or
a yoga nidra protocol.

1937
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,500
Those for me have been very
useful at helping me turn off,

1938
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,410
kinda looping thinking in
the middle of the night

1939
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,370
and fall back asleep.

1940
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:01,190
In reviewing my schedule for you,

1941
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:04,070
just as a context for how
to implement certain types

1942
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,670
of tools for optimizing learning.

1943
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,470
Realize that, it gives the impression

1944
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,410
that there's a 90 minute bout of learning

1945
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:13,000
and work in the morning
and then a 90 minute bout

1946
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,720
of creative type work in
the afternoon and that's it.

1947
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,450
There are a lot of hours
in between of course,

1948
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:19,190
and I just wanna be very clear.

1949
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:23,000
Those hours for me are occupied
by pretty not mundane tasks

1950
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,890
but things that are kinda random.

1951
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:29,030
Those are things like email
or attending to Zoom meetings

1952
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:31,740
or meeting with colleagues and students

1953
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,283
and things of that sort.

1954
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,160
I sometimes will read just
for sake of my own enrichment.

1955
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,010
I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts

1956
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:40,950
because those are the two 90 minute bouts

1957
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:43,610
where I'm trying to expand on,

1958
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:46,030
the mental capacities that I already have.

1959
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,670
They're to really where
I'm trying to stretch

1960
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:51,090
and grow what I'm able to do
on a regular basis reflexively.

1961
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:54,030
So I wanna emphasize that the
whole day doesn't just consist

1962
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:56,120
of those two 90 minute bouts.

1963
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,460
That's not the way my schedule works

1964
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,160
and that's not the way
my lifestyle is arranged.

1965
01:17:59,160 --> 01:17:59,993
Which is fortunate

1966
01:17:59,993 --> 01:18:01,690
'cause I enjoy all those
other things as well.

1967
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:03,470
And so for many of you out there who are

1968
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,300
in school or have family
demands or other demands,

1969
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,730
the key is to slot in those
brain optimization segments

1970
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:13,320
of about 90 minutes, one or
two, or maybe more per day.

1971
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,480
You're trying to slot those

1972
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,500
in wherever you can amidst to your other,

1973
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,900
obligations and things
that you need to do.

1974
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,480
But, you wanna do that
in an intelligent way

1975
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,390
that's anchored to your biology.

1976
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,840
And then you wanna do a number of things

1977
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,920
which I've talked about today,

1978
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,890
in order to optimize those sessions

1979
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,290
to get the most out of them.

1980
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,260
So as we round up, I acknowledged

1981
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,120
that once again I've covered
a huge range of topics,

1982
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,670
related to how to optimize learning,

1983
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:43,880
and brain change, and
essentially mental performance.

1984
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,600
And I've set that in the context,

1985
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,100
of some biological mechanism

1986
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,370
like the basal ganglia,
go, no-go pathways,

1987
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,820
the circadian autonomic system,

1988
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:55,970
and some of the relationship
between food and fasting

1989
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:59,113
and particular types of food
in alertness or sleepiness.

1990
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:03,900
Linear focus and strategy
implementation is best served

1991
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,510
by high alert states,
although not too alert,

1992
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:07,940
and how creative states,

1993
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,910
at least the first phase of creativity,

1994
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:12,250
which is the creative arrangement,

1995
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,240
kind of brainstorming stage

1996
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,390
is supported by states
of kind of relaxation

1997
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,760
or even slightly sleepy.

1998
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,190
But the creative
implementation is a very linear

1999
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,860
and focused and deliberate process,

2000
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:26,870
much like the highly focused
state, that I described.

2001
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,780
I described how I do these things so just

2002
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,930
to give you a context.

2003
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,300
A lot of you asked for, you know,

2004
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,450
what I do in order to
set it within a context.

2005
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:35,460
But by no means are these rigid times

2006
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:36,690
and ways of doing things.

2007
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,120
But, I think it's fair to say that,

2008
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,670
what I do has a circadian logic.

2009
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:44,873
It also has grounding
in biological mechanisms

2010
01:19:44,873 --> 01:19:46,740
that are very concrete.

2011
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,480
That we know the cells and mechanisms

2012
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,780
and neuro-transmitters.

2013
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,613
And then some

2014
01:19:50,613 --> 01:19:53,480
of them are a little
bit headed out into the,

2015
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:57,520
what we would call, kind
of emerging, or, you know,

2016
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,810
I don't wanna say cutting
edge, but maybe front edge

2017
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:01,380
of what neuroscience is
starting to understand

2018
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,260
about creativity and so forth.

2019
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,640
Those are areas that are just now,

2020
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:07,780
coming to some clarity.

2021
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:10,361
And there is certainly is
still a lot more work to do.

2022
01:20:10,361 --> 01:20:12,930
There are a lot of different
ways to arrange one's routine.

2023
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:15,840
But hopefully, the tools
and practices I described,

2024
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,840
will be useful to you.

2025
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,310
I wanna mention that a lot

2026
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:23,460
of people ask me about
specific tools and practices.

2027
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,870
They asked me of Wim Hof
Breathing, about ice baths.

2028
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:27,040
Have talked a little bit

2029
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,470
about ice baths before I
think in cold exposure.

2030
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:32,260
About binaural beats and
things of those sorts.

2031
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,480
I think the way to look at any tool,

2032
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,010
to modulate or measure the nervous system,

2033
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:42,010
is ask whether or not it's
going to move you up or down,

2034
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:43,810
the state of autonomic arousal.

2035
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,990
Whether or not it's gonna
can make you more alert

2036
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,230
or more calm.

2037
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,790
More focused or less focused.

2038
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,620
That's kind of the two axes here

2039
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,410
that we need to think about.

2040
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:53,270
Sometimes you wanna be
more alert than you are.

2041
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,350
And indeed, things like
cold showers, ice baths,

2042
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,230
super oxygenation, Wim Hof type breathing,

2043
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,440
will bring your level of alertness up.

2044
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,570
There's some cautionary notes
associated with each of those.

2045
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:03,403
You need to read

2046
01:21:03,403 --> 01:21:05,530
and understand those
cautionary notes, for yourself.

2047
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:07,600
Everybody's different and some

2048
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,170
of those carry certain dangers,
under certain conditions.

2049
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,163
Others have huge margins for safety.

2050
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,230
An ice bath generally wakes you up.

2051
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:20,300
A warmer, hot bath generally
calms you down, right?

2052
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,350
Binaural beats, there aren't a lot

2053
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:24,370
of data and quality
peer-reviewed journals.

2054
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:26,160
I did put in the effort
to go search it out.

2055
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,000
There are a few.

2056
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,820
Binaural beats are
listening to frequencies

2057
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:34,233
of sound that slightly differ
offset for the two ears.

2058
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:37,130
It has been shown, can shift the brain

2059
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:38,220
into particular states.

2060
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,510
You'll notice today, I didn't really talk

2061
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,760
about alpha or theta or gamma rhythms.

2062
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,220
I personally in reviewing the literature,

2063
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,380
I don't think it's fair to say

2064
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,120
that alpha states are great for X

2065
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,680
and theta states are great for Y.

2066
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,980
And besides, most of us aren't walking

2067
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,600
around our homes and our workplaces,

2068
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,930
geared up to EEG machines

2069
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:56,290
or with wires down below our skull.

2070
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:58,800
So we don't know when we're
in those states anyway.

2071
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,010
I think the subjective reading of whether

2072
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:05,280
or not one is alert, or calm,

2073
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,990
and whether or not that
alertness or calmness matches

2074
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,550
the goal or that thing that
we're trying to achieve

2075
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,793
in terms of learning, including sleep,

2076
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:15,780
is the most valuable,

2077
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,250
internal tool and recognition
that we can all have.

2078
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:20,080
In other words, if I want to be very alert

2079
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,230
and I need to be very
alert and I'm exhausted,

2080
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,490
there might be tools that
I should use to wake up.

2081
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,323
It might also speak to the fact

2082
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:26,720
that I might not have slept

2083
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,290
as well as I could have or
should have the night before.

2084
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:31,080
So it's really about a match

2085
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,870
between where we are on
that autonomic arousal scale

2086
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:36,350
and what we're trying to achieve.

2087
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:37,980
And indeed, there are gonna be a lot

2088
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,770
of tools including supplements
and other prescription drugs

2089
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:41,770
and things that can help,

2090
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:44,740
move us along that autonomic continuum,

2091
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,650
up toward more alertness
or toward more calmness.

2092
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:50,720
But ultimately it's about
tailoring that alertness

2093
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,070
and calmness to the
specific types of learning

2094
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:56,000
and activities that you are
going to do and perform.

2095
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,070
And, it's reciprocal.

2096
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:59,570
Meaning some of those activities

2097
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:02,260
like exercise early in the
day will increase your level

2098
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,490
of autonomic arousal and alertness.

2099
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:07,340
Certain foods, will tend to wake you up.

2100
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,400
Certain foods will tend
to make you more sleepy

2101
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,790
and the volume of food

2102
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,980
and the timing of food is a factor also.

2103
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,750
So it's a huge parameter space.

2104
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,260
It's a huge set of variables,

2105
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,180
that impacts whether or
not we're feeling well,

2106
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,970
performing well, learning
great, or not learning great.

2107
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:24,160
And the key thing is
to become an observer,

2108
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,560
of your own system and what works for you.

2109
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,280
And, to recognize that there are two bins

2110
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,190
of tools for optimizing,
learning and brain performance.

2111
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:35,440
One, are tools that are really anchored

2112
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,760
in biological mechanism

2113
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,630
and we are certain of what those are.

2114
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:39,640
I've talked about some of those.

2115
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,170
The other, the more subjective tools,

2116
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:45,110
for some of you visualization,
might work terrifically well.

2117
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:47,610
For some of you, one song
might really wake you up

2118
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,710
because of the associations
you have with it.

2119
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:51,390
And for me, I might just, you know,

2120
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:53,330
it might repel me from the room.

2121
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:56,000
'Cause I don't like it or
it might put me to sleep.

2122
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,833
But of course,

2123
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:58,800
volume is kind of a universal.

2124
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,370
Loud music tends to wake people up.

2125
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:03,440
Soft music, doesn't tend to
wake them up quite as much.

2126
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,120
So, part of today is really
getting you to think about,

2127
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,650
in a scientific way, in a structured way,

2128
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:13,590
about the non-negotiable elements

2129
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,360
which are that you're
going to have a period

2130
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,660
of every 24 hour cycle when
you tend to be more awake,

2131
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,330
and a period when you
tend to be more asleep.

2132
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,610
And how to leverage those

2133
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,040
so you're not fighting an
uphill battle to wake up

2134
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,063
when you actually,

2135
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,450
would want to be in and should be sleepy

2136
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:31,940
and not trying to go to
sleep when you are naturally,

2137
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,010
going to be most awake.

2138
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,700
So a lot of it is really anchors back

2139
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,630
to those core mechanisms of biology,

2140
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,720
and then you start layering
on the different protocols

2141
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,920
of food and supplementation, et cetera.

2142
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,670
And I think it's important
to recognize that some people

2143
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:46,923
are just more go and no-go.

2144
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,210
And some people,

2145
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,300
are just calmer and have
a harder time getting

2146
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,830
into action in an activity.

2147
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,360
It's just the way that we're wired.

2148
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,060
Some of us have autonomic nervous systems

2149
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:59,370
that are more geared towards
parasympathetic, calm states.

2150
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:02,550
One of the reasons I love
bulldogs, not just my bulldog,

2151
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:04,500
is that they are very calm animals.

2152
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,970
In fact, they make no
spontaneous movements

2153
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:09,010
unless there's something to respond to.

2154
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:11,190
And I find that incredibly relaxing.

2155
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,730
Other animals like pit bulls,

2156
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,330
who I also really like and enjoy

2157
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:16,310
and other species, their
tail is always wagging.

2158
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,650
And that they're always in a
position to make a movement

2159
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:20,720
at any any second 'cause they tend to ride

2160
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,010
at pretty high levels
of autonomic arousal.

2161
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,640
They pop up really quickly.

2162
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,500
When you say it's time to go for a walk,

2163
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,020
Costello does it one limb at a time.

2164
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,940
And sometimes he just goes back to sleep.

2165
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:34,320
And so, that there are
people like that too.

2166
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,020
And so you have to know where you are

2167
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:38,563
and what particular goals
you're trying to pursue.

2168
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:42,320
As a final closure to this,

2169
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,300
I wanna emphasize that today as always,

2170
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,060
I've strived to be accurate.

2171
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:48,160
I'm sure if I made mistakes,

2172
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,210
some of you will point
out and I appreciate that.

2173
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:52,260
And I'll post a correction,

2174
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,253
if we agree that I indeed
misspoke, or misguided something.

2175
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,940
But, by no means was I exhaustive.

2176
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,510
I mean, I might've exhausted some of you

2177
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,730
but the information wasn't exhaustive.

2178
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:05,130
Meaning, there's no way

2179
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:07,400
that I could cover all the ways in which,

2180
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,060
we optimize or can optimize
learning and performance.

2181
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:14,120
I think we've touched on a
number of them that I hope,

2182
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,150
that you'll find value in

2183
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:17,333
and that you'll explore in your own lives.

2184
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,930
We are continuing with this theme

2185
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:21,830
because that's what we
do, for this podcast.

2186
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,060
We stay on one theme for an entire month.

2187
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,320
For the next episode,

2188
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,350
we're going to explore two,

2189
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:30,710
very essential aspects of neuroplasticity.

2190
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:32,250
That actually relate to learning.

2191
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:37,250
Which are pain, pain management,
and neural regeneration.

2192
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:39,660
And for those of you that,

2193
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,730
don't have injuries or don't
suffer from chronic pain,

2194
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,500
the discussion is still gonna
be a very important one.

2195
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,830
Because it's not just going to be

2196
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,470
about pain that you're
trying to get rid of.

2197
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,550
It's also going to be about how
certain sensory experiences,

2198
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,110
within the pain network,
can become amplified,

2199
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:57,640
as well as how we can
use top-down modulation.

2200
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:01,550
We can use our mind, to
suppress the pain response.

2201
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,430
We're also gonna talk about some

2202
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:04,210
of the hardwired mechanisms,

2203
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,350
that are bottom up,

2204
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:09,210
that exist in our periphery,
in our body to control pain.

2205
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:10,740
And we're also gonna discuss,

2206
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,320
a number of interesting interactions

2207
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,070
between the pain system
and the learning system.

2208
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:19,240
So again if you're, not
interested in pain per se,

2209
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,130
it still is going to be
a very valid conversation

2210
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:25,330
for sake of understanding how
to optimize brain performance.

2211
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:27,520
And neuro-regeneration goes hand in hand,

2212
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,960
with that discussion.

2213
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,660
So I hope you'll join us for that.

2214
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,730
I suppose I'd be remiss
if I didn't mention that,

2215
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:37,590
Costello has been snoring
extremely loudly today.

2216
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,790
He had a good long walk this morning

2217
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:41,770
which means up the
driveway down the driveway.

2218
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:42,900
He's an old dog.

2219
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,900
So if you've been hearing him

2220
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,840
in the background and
it's been distracting,

2221
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,860
now you know why.

2222
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:49,170
It probably relates to, where you were

2223
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:51,260
on your level of autonomic arousal.

2224
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,093
And I'll leave it

2225
01:27:52,093 --> 01:27:54,880
to you to answer that
question for yourself.

2226
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,150
Many of you continue

2227
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:59,127
to graciously ask how you
can help support the podcast.

2228
01:27:59,127 --> 01:28:01,420
And we really appreciate the question.

2229
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:03,130
The best way is to subscribe

2230
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:05,270
wherever it is you happen
to be listening or watching.

2231
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,350
So for those of you that it's YouTube,

2232
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,520
please subscribe to the YouTube channel.

2233
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,200
If it's Apple, subscribe
to the podcast on Apple

2234
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,730
or if it's Spotify, subscribe there.

2235
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,550
Maybe you've subscribed to all three.

2236
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:17,360
If you have comments and feedback for us,

2237
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,980
suggestions for future podcast,
episodes or topics to cover,

2238
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:24,430
please, place those in the
comment section on YouTube.

2239
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:26,060
Apple also provides a section

2240
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,990
where you can give us a rating.

2241
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,620
We would love it if you
give us a five star rating

2242
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:32,100
or whatever it is that
you feel that we deserve.

2243
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:36,160
And in general, if you could
tell people about the podcast,

2244
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,300
we hope that you would tell them

2245
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,960
because you think the
information will be of use

2246
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,960
to them of course.

2247
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,490
Tell your friends, tell your family,

2248
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:44,980
tell your coworkers, because
as we expand the podcast,

2249
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,540
the support for the podcast
just grows along with it.

2250
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,590
So that's a terrific way to support us.

2251
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:51,410
As always, check out our sponsors

2252
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,290
which were mentioned at the beginning.

2253
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:54,840
And in addition to that,

2254
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,370
we've now set up a Patreon account.

2255
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:57,950
Some of you asked specifically,

2256
01:28:57,950 --> 01:28:59,430
how you can help support the podcast

2257
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:01,660
but you weren't
interested, in our sponsors

2258
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,940
or you were already
engaged with our sponsors.

2259
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,660
So, we have a Patreon account.

2260
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:10,630
You can find it at
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2261
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:13,510
Finally, in previous episodes today,

2262
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:16,520
and in future episodes,
I mentioned supplements.

2263
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,640
Supplements are one way,
certainly not the only way,

2264
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:22,310
but they're one way in
which we can modulate,

2265
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:23,900
our nervous system,

2266
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,860
for sake of better of
sleep, learning, alertness,

2267
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:28,950
and several other things as well.

2268
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,380
If you're interested in supplements,

2269
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:33,990
we've partnered with Thorne, T H O R N E,

2270
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,830
because Thorne supplements
have very high stringency

2271
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,920
in terms of, what's in the bottle,

2272
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,520
the amounts of the substances that are

2273
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,210
in each capsule or pill, et cetera.

2274
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:45,790
And, they have partnered
with other groups such

2275
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:48,010
as the Mayo Clinic, all
the major sports teams.

2276
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:50,050
So there's very high rigor
associated with Thorne

2277
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,200
which is why we've decided
to partner with them.

2278
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,880
If you'd like to check
out Thorne supplements

2279
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,560
and see the supplements that I take,

2280
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:00,560
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

2281
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:02,950
And you'll see a list of some

2282
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:04,700
of the supplements that I take.

2283
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,200
As well, you'll get 20% off,

2284
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,160
any of the supplements listed there,

2285
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,020
as well as anywhere else
on the Thorne website.

2286
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:16,020
So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman,

2287
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:19,950
for 20% off, any Thorne supplements.

2288
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:23,950
Last but not least, on
behalf of me and Costello,

2289
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:26,300
I wanna thank you for your
time and attention today.

2290
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,825
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

2291
01:30:29,825 --> 01:30:32,408
