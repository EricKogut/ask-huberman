1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,300
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,930
where we discuss science
and science based tools

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,533
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,160
[cheerful music]

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,100
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,010
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,020
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,470
Today, we are discussing aggression.

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,950
I'm going to explain to you that there are

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,370
several different types of
aggression, for instance,

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,750
reactive aggression versus
proactive aggression.

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,470
Meaning sometimes people
will be aggressive

13
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,320
because they feel threatened
or they are protecting

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,490
those that they love,
who also feel threatened.

15
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,360
There's also proactive
aggression where people

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,970
go out of their way to
deliberately try and harm others.

17
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,080
And there is indirect
aggression, which is aggression,

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,980
not involving physical
violence, for instance,

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,790
shaming people and things of that sort.

20
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,270
It turns out that there are
different biological mechanisms

21
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,900
underlying each of the
different types of aggression.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,010
And today I will define those for you.

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,910
I'll talk about the neural
circuits in the brain and body

24
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,730
that mediate each of the
different kinds of aggression.

25
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,790
Talk about some of the
hormones and peptides

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,540
and neurotransmitters involved.

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,580
I promise to make it
all accessible to you,

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,000
even if you do not have any
biology or science background,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,130
I will also discuss
tools, psychological tools

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,650
and biological tools that one can use to

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,410
better control aggression.

32
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,480
Now, right here at the outset,

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,680
I want to acknowledge that any
discussion about aggression

34
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,653
has to have an element
of context within it.

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,150
To be fair, human beings
invest a lot of money,

36
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,420
a lot of time, and a lot of energy,

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,920
and indeed can even derive
pleasure from aggression.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,900
Later I'll talk about neural
circuits in the brain and body

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,480
that reinforce, in other words,
reward through the release

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,270
of chemicals that make people feel good.

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,040
Acts of aggression.

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,120
However, what I'm mainly referring to

43
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,350
is the context in which
human beings will pay money

44
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,043
in order to derive what we
call vicarious aggression,

45
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,430
put it simply people spend
an enormous amount of money

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,300
and time and energy watching
other people engage in,

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,920
for instance, aggressive sports.

48
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,500
And we know that observing
your team winning

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,479
over another team causes the
release of neurochemicals

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,249
in your brain and body
that make you feel good.

51
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,632
And yes, that can make
you feel more aggressive.

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,622
We also know of course that
most governments invest

53
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:20,680
many billions if not trillions of dollars

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,810
in infrastructure,
technologies and human beings

55
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,370
in order to engage in
aggression if needed,

56
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,230
so-called military warfare, et cetera.

57
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,220
So today's discussion will
include a description of

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,350
aggression in the pathological sense.

59
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,270
We'll actually talk about an
explosive aggressive disorder

60
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,860
that most of you probably
haven't heard of,

61
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,320
but is actually far more
common than perhaps, you know,

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,080
we'll talk about the role of
things like attention deficit,

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,260
hyperactivity disorder,

64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,160
and how that can relate
to aggression through

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
the relationship between
impulsivity and aggression.

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,390
And we'll talk about verbal aggression,

67
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,850
physical aggression, proactive aggression,

68
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,550
as mentioned before,
and reactive aggression.

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,990
I'm certain that by
the end of the episode,

70
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,800
you will come away with a much
more thorough understanding

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,740
of what this thing that we
call aggression really is.

72
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,628
And when you see it in other people,

73
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,800
I think it will make more sense to you.

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,530
And when you observe it in
yourself or the impulse to engage

75
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,670
in aggression, verbal,
or physical or otherwise,

76
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,700
I hope that you'll
understand it better as well.

77
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,744
And of course, the tools
that I will describe

78
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:25,240
should allow you to modulate and control

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,250
aggressive tendencies or
predispositions to aggressiveness

80
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,950
and just generally to be
able to engage with people

81
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,090
in a more adaptive way overall.

82
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,750
Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,610
is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.

84
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,040
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

85
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,640
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,470
and science related tools
to the general public.

87
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,520
In keeping with that theme,

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,560
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

89
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

90
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,430
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

91
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,600
probiotic drink that's designed to meet

92
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,940
all your foundational health needs.

93
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,300
I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

94
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,060
So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring this podcast.

95
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,810
The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens

96
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,410
and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens

97
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,160
once or twice a day is that
it covers all of my basic

98
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,970
vitamin mineral and probiotic needs.

99
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,860
The probiotics are
especially important to me.

100
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,110
There are now abundant data
showing that the gut microbiome,

101
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,100
which is basically a
community of trillions

102
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,950
of little bacteria that live
in our guts are beneficial

103
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,580
for our immune system, for brain function,

104
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,970
for mood and many other
aspects of our health.

105
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,330
The gut microbiome thrives on
probiotics and Athletic Greens

106
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,620
contains the proper array of probiotics

107
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,750
to optimize the gut microbiome.

108
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,070
Athletic Greens also has
adaptogens for recovery

109
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,000
from physical and mental exertion,

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,390
digestive enzymes for gut
health, vitamin C, zinc,

111
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,800
as I mentioned before, all the
other vitamins and minerals

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,330
that you need in order to cover
your basic needs each day.

113
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,680
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,420
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

115
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,150
and claim a special offer.

116
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,300
That'll give you five free
travel packs that make it easy

117
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,010
and a year supply of Vitamin D3K2.

119
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,840
There's now a wealth of
data showing that vitamin D3

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,290
is important for many
aspects of our immediate

121
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,990
and long term health.

122
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,990
Many people, even if they
get out in the sunlight

123
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,440
are not getting enough Vitamin D3,

124
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,540
and the K2 is thought to be beneficial

125
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,360
for calcium regulation and
a number of other things

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
important to our health.

127
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,240
So again, if you go to
athleticGreens.com/huberman,

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,760
you can claim the
special offer of the five

129
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,550
free travel packs and the
year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

130
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,270
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

131
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,040
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

132
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,140
that are the absolute highest quality.

133
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,240
The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers

134
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,710
from Stanford and everything
about their eyeglasses

135
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,110
and sunglasses were designed
with performance in mind,

136
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,240
I've spent a lifetime
working on the biology

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,780
of the visual system, I can
tell you that your visual system

138
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,240
has to contend with some
pretty tough challenges

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,280
as you move throughout the day.

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,640
For instance, if you go
from a brightly lit region

141
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,830
to a dimmer region, your
visual system has to adjust.

142
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,570
ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were designed

143
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,470
with those sorts of adjustments in mind.

144
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,370
So for instance, if you're
outside in the shade,

145
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,130
you move into the sun and
then back into the shade,

146
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,323
you don't have to take
your sunglasses on and off.

147
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,370
Their glasses were initially designed

148
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,980
for sports performance
and the great thing is

149
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,620
they could be used for
that, but also they have

150
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,880
a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them

151
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,930
to work or out to dinner.

152
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,110
I wear readers at night
and when I drive at night

153
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,530
and I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot

154
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,580
on really bright days.

155
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,770
The terrific thing about
ROKA glasses is that even

156
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,250
if you get sweaty, they won't fall off.

157
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,630
So you can run with them,
you can cycle with them.

158
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,200
Or as I mentioned before, you can just

159
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,500
wear them out and about.

160
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,950
If you'd like to try ROKA,
you can go to roka.com,

161
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,870
that's R-O-K-A.com and

162
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,130
to save 20% off your first order.

163
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,270
Again, that's ROKA roka.com

164
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,600
and enter the code "Huberman" at checkout.

165
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,480
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

166
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,420
Helix Sleep makes mattresses
and pillows that in my opinion

167
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,340
are the very best you'll find.

168
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,185
I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

169
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,787
a little over a year ago,

170
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,562
and it's the best sleep
I've had ever since.

171
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:08,370
If you go to the Helix site,
they have a terrific sleep quiz

172
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,897
that just takes a few minutes,
ask you questions like,

173
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,810
"Do you tend to sleep on your side,

174
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,070
your back or your stomach?"

175
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,980
Maybe you don't know
because you're asleep,

176
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,300
but many people do know.

177
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,800
And even if you don't know that's okay,

178
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,067
it will also ask you questions like,

179
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,740
"Do you tend to run hot or cold?"

180
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,860
Do you tend to wake up in the
middle of the night or not?

181
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,740
And by taking that brief
quiz, they will match you

182
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,630
to the specific mattress
that's ideal for you

183
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,840
and your sleep needs.

184
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,157
And that's really what sets
Helix Sleep mattresses apart.

185
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:35,340
Everybody's unique, and they know that.

186
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,030
So if you take this
quiz, you'll get matched

187
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,863
to a particular mattress.

188
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,020
For me, it was the
"Dusk" mattress D-U-S-K,

189
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,690
but again, that's just me,
and you may match to that one,

190
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,696
or you may match to a different one.

191
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,570
If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress

192
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,070
and sleeping much better, go
to helixsleep.com/huberman.

193
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,850
Take that two minute sleep
quiz and they'll match you

194
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,150
to a customized mattress and
you'll get up to $200 off

195
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,240
any mattress order and two free pillows.

196
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,193
I also love their pillows.

197
00:07:58,193 --> 00:07:59,770
I've always had this issue with pillows

198
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,080
that they heat up too much.

199
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,550
I'm always looking for the
pillow that can cool itself.

200
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,620
Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool.

201
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,752
They're also not too big,
so I'm not propped up,

202
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,270
not getting the Text Neck
in the middle of the night,

203
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,520
where I'm letting my chin push my chest,

204
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,450
nor am I falling back and
having trouble breathing

205
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,283
in the middle of the night.

206
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:16,210
They're designed just right.

207
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,860
They also have a 10 years warranty

208
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,570
and you get to try it out for
a hundred nights, risk free.

209
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,130
They'll even pick it up for
you if you don't love it.

210
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,360
But I think that you will.

211
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,570
Again, if you're interested, you can go

212
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,580
to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off

213
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,080
and two free pillows.

214
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,820
Let's talk about aggression.

215
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,679
I think that many people
out there are put off

216
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,019
by aggression, although
others are drawn to aggression

217
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,768
both in themselves and when
observing it in others.

218
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:44,030
The reason to talk about aggression is,

219
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,399
that as mentioned before,

220
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,170
the context of aggression really matters.

221
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,780
So there are instances where
aggression is adaptive.

222
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,350
For instance, a mother
protecting her children

223
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,450
if she's being attacked,

224
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,600
or if her children are being threatened.

225
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,930
I think most people would
agree that so-called

226
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,210
maternal aggression of that sort,

227
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,680
provided the context is
right, is a great thing.

228
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,700
Protecting our young is
after all one of the primary

229
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,950
adaptive drives of our species,
and thank goodness it is.

230
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,890
Of course, other forms of aggression

231
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,920
like unprovoked, proactive aggression,

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,272
somebody simply being
violent to somebody else,

233
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:22,170
even when unprovoked, most of us cringe

234
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,750
when we see that kind of behavior,

235
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,140
it can even evoke aggression in people

236
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,740
when they observe that kind of behavior.

237
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,180
So again, context really matters,

238
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,930
but a more general and perhaps
an even more important reason

239
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,485
to think about and understand aggression

240
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:39,620
is that by understanding the biology

241
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,490
and psychology of aggression, you will be

242
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,480
in a much better position to understand

243
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,850
how all emotional states come to be,

244
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,140
both in yourself and in others.

245
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,840
For instance, many of you have
probably heard the statement

246
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,440
that I believe arises from pop psychology,

247
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,840
not from formal academic psychology,

248
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,240
that aggression is just sadness.

249
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,260
It's a form of sadness that's amplified

250
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,060
and it shows up as aggression.

251
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,510
But when we look at the underlying biology

252
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,484
and the peer reviewed literature on this,

253
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,640
nothing could be further from the truth.

254
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,360
We have distinct circuits
in the brain for aggression

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,320
versus grief and mourning,
those are non-overlapping.

256
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,010
Now that doesn't mean that you
can't be sad and aggressive

257
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,010
or in a state of mourning and
aggressive at the same time,

258
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,770
but the idea that sadness and aggression

259
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,370
are one in the same
thing is simply not true.

260
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,810
And by understanding that,
or perhaps by understanding

261
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,110
that irritability and aggression
are not the same thing,

262
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,120
you'll be in a much
better position to apply

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,290
some of the tools that we will
talk about in this episode

264
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,970
in order to be able to
reduce or eliminate,

265
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,890
or if it's adaptive to you
to modulate aggression.

266
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,730
And yes, there are cases where
modulating your aggression

267
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,500
in some cases, even amplifying
aggression can be adaptive.

268
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,760
Now this of course is
not the first discussion

269
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
about the biology of aggression

270
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,067
or the psychology of aggression.

271
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,110
And we really can look to the
beginning of the last century

272
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,201
as the time in which the formal study

273
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,750
of aggression really began.

274
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,500
One of the names that's most
associated with the formal

275
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,730
study of aggression is none
other than Konrad Lorenz.

276
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,590
Some of you may be
familiar with that name,

277
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,347
others of you may not be
familiar with that name.

278
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:25,347
Konrad Lorenz studied
so-called imprinting behaviors

279
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,980
and fixed action pattern behaviors.

280
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,338
He's most famous, at least
in scientific circles,

281
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:34,400
for getting geese to believe
that he was their parent.

282
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,580
And if you were to put into
Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz,

283
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,160
just as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese,

284
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,910
you're going to see a
lot of photos of Conrad

285
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,260
walking down roads with a
lot of geese following him

286
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,588
or swimming in lakes with a
lot of geese following him.

287
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:49,870
He had a habit of geese adopting him

288
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,780
because of the behaviors
that he partook in.

289
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,260
So he would swim out on a lake

290
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,550
in front of a bunch of
little geese and then

291
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,000
they would think that he was the parent

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,930
and they would imprint on him.

293
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,420
He even lived with these
animals and they lived with him,

294
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,660
sort of a strange
character from what I hear.

295
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,110
But nonetheless, all
this work was deserving

296
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,510
of a Nobel prize because
what he discovered

297
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,126
were fixed action patterns.

298
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:11,170
That is patterns of behavior

299
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,020
that could be evoked by a single stimulus.

300
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,541
Okay. This is really important.

301
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:19,200
The idea that you can get a
whole category of behaviors,

302
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,620
like swimming behind a parent,

303
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,680
or looking to somebody for
comfort, and only them,

304
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,690
the idea that you could
get a huge category

305
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,050
of different behaviors in a
bunch of different contexts

306
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,630
triggered by just the presence
of that person is remarkable,

307
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,220
because what it suggested
and what turns out to be true

308
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,440
is that there are neural circuits,

309
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,470
not just individual brain
areas, but collections

310
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,100
of brain areas that work together

311
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,600
to engage a pattern of behaviors.

312
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,610
And that's the first fundamental principle

313
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,310
that we need to define today,

314
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,640
that when we talk about aggression,

315
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,550
we are talking about
activation of neural circuits,

316
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,160
not individual brain
areas, but neural circuits

317
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,010
that get played out in
sequence like keys on a piano,

318
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,780
but that playing out in sequence means

319
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,930
that aggression is a verb.

320
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,330
It has a beginning, a middle
and an end, and it's a process.

321
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,960
It's not an event.

322
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,140
And as you'll see, that turns
out to be very important

323
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,950
in terms of thinking about
how one can halt aggression,

324
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,110
prevent it from happening
before it's initiated,

325
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,520
or maybe even prolonging aggression,

326
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,760
if that's what's needed.

327
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,050
Now, Konrad Lorenz had no real
knowledge of neural circuits.

328
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,920
I mean, obviously he
knew there was this thing

329
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,300
that we call a brain and a nervous system,

330
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,990
and he knew that there
were chemicals in the brain

331
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,750
and hormones and things of that sort

332
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,290
that were likely to play a role,

333
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,170
but he really didn't take
any measures to define

334
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,710
what the neural circuits were,
frankly, he didn't need to.

335
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,630
He had his Nobel prize and he
did all this beautiful work.

336
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,850
He's known for an abundance of work,

337
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,290
but he did think about what
sorts of underlying processes

338
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,760
could drive something like aggression.

339
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,640
And he talked about one particular feature

340
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,110
that's especially important,

341
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,590
and that's this notion of a pressure.

342
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:07,590
The idea that yes, certain
hormones will bias somebody

343
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,430
or an animal to be aggressive,

344
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,420
certain neural transmitter
states, and you'll learn

345
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,020
what those are today will bias somebody

346
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,770
to be more or less aggressive,

347
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,680
maybe even submissive and passive,

348
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,110
maybe outright proactively
aggressive towards anyone

349
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,710
or anything in front of them.

350
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,690
And yes, of course there
will be historical features

351
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,939
based on their childhood,
et cetera, et cetera.

352
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:31,580
He understood that there will
be a constellation of things

353
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,216
that would drive people to be aggressive.

354
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:36,300
And he described a so-called pressure,

355
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,770
almost like a hydraulic pressure.

356
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,370
Just think about fluid
pressure in a small container

357
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,300
being pushed, pushed,
pushed until the can,

358
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,490
or the container is ready to explode

359
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,130
and how multiple features,
multiple variables

360
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,280
could impinge on that
and create that pressure.

361
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,010
It turns out that's exactly
the way the system works.

362
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,570
There is no single brain area

363
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,840
that flips the switch for aggression.

364
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,660
Although we'll soon talk
about a brain structure

365
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,940
that generally houses the propensity

366
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,433
and the output of aggression.

367
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,760
This notion of a hydraulic
pressure that can drive us

368
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,120
toward aggressive behavior
or conversely can be

369
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,680
very low pressure and keep us
in a state of non-reactivity,

370
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,700
maybe even passivity or submissiveness

371
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,410
is a very important feature
because it really captures

372
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,940
the essence of how neural circuits work

373
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,400
when we're talking about
primitive behaviors generally.

374
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,350
And you can start to notice
this in yourself and in others,

375
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,700
you can start to notice
when you are veering

376
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,360
toward aggression or
when someone is veering

377
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,130
toward aggression, verbal or physical.

378
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:44,030
Now that veering is the buildup
of this hydraulic pressure

379
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,460
that Lorenz was referring to,

380
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,223
and it really does have an
underlying biological basis.

381
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,340
Now it was some years later
that the first experiments

382
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,820
came along, which really
started to identify

383
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,640
the brain areas and the
biological so-called pressures

384
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,370
that can induce aggressive behavior.

385
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,170
And the person that really
gets credit for this

386
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,150
is a guy by the name of Walter Hess,

387
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,840
who at that time was working on cats.

388
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,000
And I know that when say working on cats,

389
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,890
a lot of people will cringe.

390
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,280
A lot of people have cats as pets,

391
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,430
and certainly cats can be delightful.

392
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,550
Some people like them more,
some people like them less.

393
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,280
Most people cringe at the idea
of doing experiments on cats.

394
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,690
I should say that these days,

395
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,520
very few laboratories work on cats.

396
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,750
Most laboratories that
work on animal models

397
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,280
will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies

398
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,440
for their capacity to do genetics,

399
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,902
on laboratory mice, sometimes
rats, but usually mice.

400
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:41,430
And occasionally you'll find a
lab that still works on cats.

401
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,430
Back in the time of Hess,
very few laboratories

402
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,350
worked on mice, most laboratories
worked on cats or rats.

403
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,250
And the reason for that is
nowadays most laboratories

404
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,250
use mice if they use animal models

405
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,610
because of the genetic
tools that exist in mice

406
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,520
to knock out this gene or
knock in this gene, et cetera,

407
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,140
which can't be done in
humans or non-human primates,

408
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,710
at least not very easily
at this point in history.

409
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,410
So when I say he was working on cats,

410
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,599
I realized that probably
evokes some negative emotions

411
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,131
in some of you, maybe even
aggression in some of you,

412
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:14,940
what we can do, however,
is look at the data

413
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,003
and make use of the data in
terms of our understanding.

414
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,920
What Hess did was he
had cats that were awake

415
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,160
and he was able to lower
a stimulating electrode

416
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,992
into their brain.

417
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:26,825
Now keep in mind that the brain

418
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,560
does not have any pain sensors.

419
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,900
So after a small hole
is made in the skull,

420
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,330
electrodes are lowered into the brain.

421
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,420
This is what's done commonly
in human neurosurgery.

422
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,480
And he was able to stimulate
different brain areas

423
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,190
and he was sort of poking around.

424
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,900
And when I say sort of,
he was doing this with

425
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,730
some logical intent and purpose,

426
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,210
he wasn't just poking
around in there for fun.

427
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,210
He was trying to identify brain
regions that could generate

428
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:55,340
entire categories of
behavior, ALA Lorenz, right?

429
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,193
These fixed action pattern behaviors.

430
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,933
Eventually his electrode landed in a site

431
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,010
and he provided electrical
stimulation to the cat

432
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,010
that caused this otherwise
passive purring relaxing cat

433
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,150
to suddenly go into an absolute rage.

434
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,340
So arched back, hissing hair up.

435
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,370
So called piloerection,
where the hairs go up,

436
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,390
animals try to make
themselves as big as possible

437
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,890
often when they're aggressive.

438
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,240
Drooling, maybe even
spitting, believe it or not,

439
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,120
cats and other animals can do this.

440
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,060
And the cat tried to
attack him or anyone else,

441
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,300
and anything else, even inanimate objects

442
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,900
when he stimulated this
particula brain area.

443
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,160
So Hess obviously took notice

444
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,140
of this incredible
transformation in behavior.

445
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,310
And the fact that when he
turned off the stimulation

446
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,820
of this particular brain area,

447
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,010
the cat very quickly within seconds,

448
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,140
went back to being passive calm kitty.

449
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,620
Now, of course, he repeated
this experiment in other animals

450
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,830
because he had to confirm that
it wasn't just happenstance,

451
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,360
that there wasn't something
unique about this one cat

452
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,530
that perhaps he had stimulated an area

453
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,350
that had been built up during
the kittenhood of this cat

454
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,590
and had been reactivated.

455
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,820
Maybe this kitten had been
traumatized early in life

456
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,850
or scared and reactivation
of a particular circuit,

457
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,637
unique to that cat created
this aggressive behavior.

458
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:26,640
That wasn't the case,
every cat that he looked at

459
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,840
and stimulated this particular brain area,

460
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,300
the cat would immediately
go into an aggressive,

461
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,600
almost rage type behavior.

462
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
Now, of course we can't anthropomorphize.

463
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,770
We don't know what the cat was feeling.

464
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,130
For all we know the cat could be happy,

465
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,010
although that seems pretty unlikely

466
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,730
and later experiments done in mice,

467
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,034
but also in humans confirm that indeed,

468
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,980
stimulation of this brain area evoked

469
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,840
not just behavioral aggression,

470
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,400
but also subjective feelings
of aggression and anger.

471
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,058
So what was this incredible brain area,

472
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:58,820
or rather, I should say,
what is the brain area

473
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,580
that harbored this incredible capacity

474
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,523
to generate aggressive
behavior in Hess's experiments?

475
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,620
Well, for those of you
that are regular listeners

476
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,630
of this podcast, you'll
probably be relieved to know

477
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,350
that today we're going to talk
about some new neural circuits,

478
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,580
oftentimes we'll center
back on the amygdala

479
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,837
or the prefrontal cortex,
and those names will come up.

480
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,880
And for those of you that
haven't heard them before,

481
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,540
don't worry, I'll make it clear as to what

482
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,040
those brain areas are and what they do.

483
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,300
But today we're going to talk a lot about

484
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,030
the so-called VMH or
ventromedial hypothalamus.

485
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,380
The ventromedial
hypothalamus is a nucleus,

486
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,810
meaning a small collection of neurons...

487
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,940
What are neurons?

488
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,550
Nerve cells, and that
small collection of neurons

489
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,460
that we call the ventromedial
hypothalamus is truly small.

490
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,990
It's only about 1,500 neurons
on one side of your brain

491
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,440
and a matching 1,500 neurons
on the other side of your brain

492
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,940
and that combined 3000 neurons
or so, it's not exactly 3000,

493
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,940
but 3000 neurons or so
is sufficient to generate

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,735
aggressive behavior of the sort

495
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:11,700
that Hess observed in the
cat, and believe it or not,

496
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,590
when you see somebody
who's in an act of rage

497
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,110
or in an act of verbal aggression

498
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,280
or in an act of defensive aggression,

499
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,285
protecting their family or loved
ones or country, et cetera,

500
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:28,285
almost certainly those neurons
are engaged in that behavior.

501
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,690
Those neurons are perhaps
even generating that behavior.

502
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,150
And next I'll describe some
experiments that were done

503
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,790
just recently within
the last 10 years or so,

504
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,310
but leading right up until this year

505
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,150
and even last month that keep confirming

506
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,000
again and again and again,

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,630
that it is the activity of neurons

508
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,260
in the ventromedial hypothalamus
that are both necessary

509
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,030
and sufficient to
generate the full catalog

510
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,820
of aggressive behaviors.

511
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,440
Now, before I go further to describe

512
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,640
the beautiful recent studies on the VMH,

513
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,080
the ventromedial hypothalamus,

514
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,130
and the important role of testosterone,

515
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,520
and more importantly, estrogen,

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,680
in the activation of aggressive
behavior, that's right.

517
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,391
That's soon to be clear to
you why that's the case.

518
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:15,100
I want to emphasize that the
ventromedial hypothalamus

519
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,600
is something that we
should all care about.

520
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,860
Why?

521
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,410
Well, it turns out that many categories

522
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,910
of psychiatric disorders,
developmental disorders,

523
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,170
and psychological challenges,
things like schizophrenia,

524
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,720
PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression,

525
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,910
borderline personality disorder,

526
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,350
and even certain forms of
autism can include elements

527
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,050
of aggression and even violence.

528
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,150
Now it's certainly not the case
that aggression and violence

529
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,210
are present in all people
who suffer from schizophrenia

530
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,110
or PTSD or depression or autism

531
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,934
or borderline personality disorder.

532
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:53,270
I'm absolutely not saying that.

533
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,090
However, it can be a feature of those.

534
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,770
And it's a well described feature

535
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,329
in terms of trying to
understand the constellation

536
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:04,180
of challenges that people suffer
from when they have those.

537
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,415
So thinking about the VMH goes
way beyond just understanding

538
00:23:06,415 --> 00:23:10,160
basic aggression in the
context of adaptive aggression.

539
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,200
So, you know, when
earlier I use the example,

540
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,168
maternal aggression, that's one
adaptive form of aggression.

541
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:20,040
It also can be pathologic aggression,

542
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,520
meaning it can harm ourselves or others.

543
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,090
So keep this in mind as we go forward,

544
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,317
because later we're going
to talk about specific tools

545
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:31,270
designed to modulate or prevent
aggression in, for instance,

546
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,760
people with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder,

547
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,763
and especially kids with ADHD.

548
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,130
In the meantime, let's return to the VMH,

549
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,027
this relatively small
collection of neurons.

550
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,090
And the reason I say
relatively small is, well,

551
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,250
your brain has many hundreds
of billions of neurons,

552
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,690
maybe even trillions of neurons,

553
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,670
the exact number of
neurons isn't really clear,

554
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,070
but it's a lot.

555
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,130
And it certainly is a lot
relative to the number of neurons

556
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,710
this 3000 or so neurons
living in your hypothalamus

557
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,523
that can evoke this aggressive response.

558
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,980
Experiments done by David
Anderson's lab at Caltech

559
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,010
were really the first to
parse the fine circuitry

560
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,010
and to really show that the
ventromedial hypothalamus

561
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,320
is both necessary and sufficient
for aggressive behavior.

562
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,450
These are important experiments

563
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,912
and they're worth knowing about.

564
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:24,912
What they did was they
identified, first of all,

565
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,160
where the ventromedial
hypothalamus was in the mouse,

566
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,990
that was pretty straightforward
to do was sort of known

567
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,830
before they started these experiments.

568
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,830
And then they analyzed which
genes, meaning which DNA,

569
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,520
which of course becomes RNA
and RNA becomes protein,

570
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,240
which DNA and therefore
which proteins are expressed

571
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,900
in particular cells of the
ventromedial hypothalamus.

572
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,590
And it turns out that
there's a particular category

573
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,070
of neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus

574
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,977
that make an estrogen receptor.

575
00:24:56,977 --> 00:25:01,010
And it is those neurons in
particular that are responsible

576
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,120
for generating aggressive behavior.

577
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,060
How did they know this?

578
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,570
Well, they used a tool that's
actually been described

579
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,200
by a previous guest of this podcast.

580
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,760
We had an episode with the
psychiatrist and bioengineer

581
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,670
and my colleague at
Stanford School of Medicine,

582
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,060
Karl Deisseroth, he and
others have developed tools

583
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,660
that allow people to control
the activity of neurons

584
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,910
essentially by remote control,

585
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,600
by shining light on those neurons.

586
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,890
So in the context of an
experiment on a mouse,

587
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,670
which is what David's
lab did, and these were

588
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,210
the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin

589
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,960
who's now in her own laboratory
at New York University,

590
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,200
put a little fiber optic
cable down into the brain

591
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,260
into the hypothalamus
that is of the mouse.

592
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,530
The mouse is able to move around
in its cage freely moving,

593
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,440
even though it has a little
tether, this little wire,

594
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,630
it's a very thin wire.

595
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,160
And that little thin wire is actually

596
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,470
a little what we call optrode.

597
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,860
And the experimentalist
in this case, Dayu,

598
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,670
was able to stimulate the turning on

599
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,607
of a little bit of blue
light and that blue light

600
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:03,380
activated only those
estrogen receptor neurons

601
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,892
in only the ventromedial hypothalamus

602
00:26:05,892 --> 00:26:07,177
and the way she was able to do that,

603
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:10,540
is she had introduced a
gene that had been developed

604
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,240
by our friend, Karl
Deisseroth that allows light

605
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,890
to trigger electrical
activity in those neurons.

606
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,230
So if any of that is confusing,

607
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,160
or if all of that is confusing,
here's the experiment.

608
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,170
There's a mouse in a cage.

609
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,650
It has a little wire
coming out of its head.

610
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,560
It doesn't notice, believe it or not.

611
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,390
We know this 'cause it's
still eating and mating

612
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,800
and doing all the things
that mics like to do

613
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,819
on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.

614
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:36,250
And the mere pressing of
a button will activate

615
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,730
a little bit of light released
at the end of that wire,

616
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,610
that light activates particular
neurons in this case,

617
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,970
it's the estrogen receptor
containing neurons

618
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,883
in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.

619
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,320
When that mouse is in a
cage with another mouse,

620
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,540
a couple of things happen depending on

621
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,730
what the other mouse is, or we could say

622
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,240
who the other mouse is.

623
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,750
If it's a male mouse and you put in there

624
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,470
with a female mouse, the male
mouse will attempt to mate

625
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,450
with a female mouse
provided that the male mouse

626
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,340
has gone through puberty.

627
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,930
He will try to mount and
mate with the female mouse.

628
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,260
Now female mice are either
in a receptive phase

629
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,770
or a non-receptive phase of
their so-called estrous cycle.

630
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,590
They don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle

631
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,530
They have an estrous cycle.

632
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,496
And on particular days
of the estrous cycle,

633
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:22,440
they are not happy to mate.

634
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,460
They will basically
keep their hindquarters

635
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,570
away from the male mouse at all costs.

636
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,320
They'll even attack the male mouse.

637
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,640
On certain days of the
estrous cycle, however,

638
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,800
the female mouse will undergo
what's called lordosis,

639
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,840
which is an arching of her
back and she'll allow the male

640
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,820
to mount and mate with her.

641
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,600
So a large number of
experiments were done,

642
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,320
but the first experiment really
was to put the male mouse

643
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,120
in with a female mouse
who's in the so-called

644
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,340
receptive phase of estrus.

645
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,350
That is, she will allow mating
and he starts mating with her

646
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,750
and they go through
the standard repertoire

647
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,533
of mating behaviors that
you observe in mice:

648
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:03,270
mounting, thrusting,
intromission as it's called

649
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,310
in the mouse sex world.

650
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,610
Well, I guess I don't know
what the mice call it,

651
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,390
but that's what the experimenters call it.

652
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,000
And then afterwards that
he will dismount, okay.

653
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,360
So they observe this kind
of mounting and sex behavior

654
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,140
is very typical, but about
halfway through the behavior,

655
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,600
Dayu turned on the light to stimulate

656
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,900
these estrogen receptor containing neurons

657
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,050
only in the male mouse
and what she observed

658
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,160
was incredibly dramatic.

659
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,400
The male mouse ceases from trying to mate

660
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,040
with the female mouse
and immediately tries

661
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,510
to kill the female mouse.

662
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,710
He starts attacking her.

663
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,160
Then she turns off the
light, the male stops

664
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,220
and goes back to trying to
mate with the female mouse.

665
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,280
So I'm sure all of this was very confusing

666
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,880
and disturbing to the female mouse.

667
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,370
Nonetheless, that was the repertoire.

668
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,510
They would mate.

669
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,460
She would stimulate these
ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.

670
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,710
The male mouse would
immediately try and attack

671
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,458
and kill the female mouse.

672
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,710
And then she would stop the stimulation

673
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,360
and he would stop trying
to attack and kill

674
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,910
the female mouse, return
to the attempt, at least,

675
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,513
to mate with the female mouse.

676
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,090
These are such dramatic shifts in behavior

677
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,120
triggered only by the
activation of only the small set

678
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,650
of neurons within the
ventromedial hypothalamus.

679
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,290
And for those of you that think

680
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,930
that you can watch this sort of thing

681
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,929
without being disturbed, I
encourage you to go to YouTube.

682
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,260
We will provide a link
where you can see a video

683
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,230
of this type of behavior.

684
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,020
It's incredibly dramatic.

685
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,350
The shift in behavior
is almost instantaneous,

686
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,090
occurs within seconds,
if not milliseconds,

687
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,816
thousandths of a second.

688
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:40,579
The next experiment that she
did was to put a male mouse

689
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,810
with this stimulation
with light capability

690
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,770
in its ventromedial
hypothalamus into a cage alone,

691
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,380
but with a rubber glove
filled with air or water.

692
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,780
Mouse, walking around sniffing, peeing,

693
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,040
which is what male mice seem to do.

694
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
They seem to urinate
everywhere, that's actually

695
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,670
an interesting, perhaps
interesting feature of male mice

696
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,850
and actually many male
animals, perhaps even humans.

697
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,850
We don't know, or maybe we do know,

698
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,610
basically this has been an
observed time and time again

699
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,410
in experiments, mainly
by Lisa Stowers's lab

700
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,560
at the Scripps Institute,
that's characterized this.

701
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,290
If you put female mice
into an arena or a cage,

702
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,930
they always urinate in a very
small corner of that cage.

703
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,210
Whereas if you put mail mice
into an arena or a cage,

704
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,600
the urinate everywhere,
they have this obsession

705
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,430
with spraying their urine everywhere,

706
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,343
you can transpose that to
human behavior if you like.

707
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:34,750
In any event, Dayu put the
mouse in the cage alone,

708
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,330
but with this rubber glove,

709
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,750
the mouse is walking around
urinating, et cetera,

710
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,240
doing whatever is that mice do,

711
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,500
then she stimulates the activation

712
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,960
of these ventromedial
hypothalamus neurons,

713
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,420
and the mouse immediately
tries to kill the glove.

714
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,460
It goes into a rage, attacking the glove

715
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,080
as if it were another mouse
or some other animate object.

716
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,830
But of course it's an inanimate object.

717
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,380
It's just a rubber glove.

718
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,880
She stops the stimulation and the mouse

719
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,040
immediately goes back
to being completely calm

720
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,870
or at least not attacking.

721
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,392
Again, we don't know what
the mouse was feeling.

722
00:31:06,392 --> 00:31:08,510
So these are very dramatic videos.

723
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,130
Again, you can see them
by following the link

724
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,910
that we'll provide in the caption.

725
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,760
If that sort of thing
is going to disturb you,

726
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,080
by to see, for instance, the attack,

727
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,410
one mouse attacking another,

728
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,790
please just don't watch them.

729
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,620
I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody

730
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,381
or you traumatizing yourself, that is.

731
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,050
A number of different variations

732
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,120
were done on this experiment.

733
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,120
For instance, stimulating
the VMH in female mice,

734
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,800
as opposed to male mice,

735
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,720
putting the female mice
in with other female mice

736
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,890
or with other male mice,
no matter what variation

737
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,660
one carries out, so it doesn't matter

738
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,470
if it's male with female, male with male,

739
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,691
female with female, et cetera,

740
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:50,090
stimulation of the
ventromedial hypothalamus

741
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,610
in a male mouse or a female
mouse evokes this very dramatic,

742
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,210
almost instantaneous aggressive behavior,

743
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,760
physically aggressive behavior.

744
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,140
Subsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin

745
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,580
in her own laboratory
and other laboratories

746
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,480
have shown that the ventromedial
hypothalamus connected

747
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,560
with a bunch of other brain
areas that are interesting,

748
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,550
And I'll talk about some
of those in a little bit,

749
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,990
but one of them that
I want to call out now

750
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,270
is the so-called PAG, the
periaqueductal gray nucleus.

751
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,250
This is a large structure
in the back of the brain

752
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,840
that houses things like neurons
that can create opioids.

753
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,870
We all know of the opioid
crisis, but these are neurons

754
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,060
that can produce endogenous,
means made by the body,

755
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,770
chemicals that can cause pain relief.

756
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,840
You could understand why that might occur

757
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,300
in a circuit for aggression, right?

758
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,516
Even if one is the aggressor, it's likely

759
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:42,850
that they may incur some physical damage

760
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,500
and they'd want some pain relief.

761
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,170
The PAG also is connected to a number

762
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,650
of neural circuits that eventually,

763
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,290
through several processing
stations, excuse me,

764
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,260
arrive at things like the jaws.

765
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,670
And in fact, stimulation of
the ventromedial hypothalamus

766
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,860
can evoke biting and
aggressive biting behavior.

767
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,270
Now aggressive biting behavior
is particularly interesting

768
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,490
because in humans and
especially in human children,

769
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,330
biting is something that,
while young children might do

770
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,660
as a form of aggression,
tends to disappear

771
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,080
pretty early in childhood.

772
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,550
And if it doesn't, it's often
seen as a mark of pathology.

773
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,520
I have a story about this,
actually, when I was a kid,

774
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,520
I went to a summer sports camp
and I'll never forget this,

775
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,300
so we're playing soccer and
in a rare stroke of luck

776
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,130
or accident, I happened to score a goal.

777
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,620
I wasn't a particularly
good soccer player,

778
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,960
especially not at that stage of my life.

779
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,770
They later figured out
that it was just better

780
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,070
to make me a fullback, 'cause
I could just wait there

781
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,470
and do what fullbacks do.

782
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,760
I was better at taking
the ball or the person out

783
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,105
than I was putting the ball in the goal.

784
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:53,370
Nonetheless, I, again,
by chance, scored a goal

785
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,930
and I was trotting back
to my side of the field,

786
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,650
and all of a sudden I felt
this sting in my back,

787
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,310
a kid, not to be named, although
I do remember your name,

788
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,210
I'm not going to tell
you what his name was.

789
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,460
A kid jumped on my back and
bit me on the top of my back.

790
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,889
And this of course resulted
in a discussion and a timeout

791
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,569
and all the usual things and
parents I think got involved.

792
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,210
I don't recall, I didn't
think much else of it,

793
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,850
but I recall that this was
considered especially troubling

794
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,989
behavior because he bit
me as opposed to hit me

795
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,959
or shoved me down or something that sort,

796
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,550
and it does seem as if
the tendency to use biting

797
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,550
as an aggressive behavior is associated

798
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,960
with a more primitive circuitry.

799
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,830
Now here I'm truly anthropomorphizing.

800
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,750
I don't know what this other
kid happened to be thinking

801
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,630
or feeling at the time, how could I?

802
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,730
And I certainly am not going to say

803
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,100
that biting in every case
reflects a pathology,

804
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,409
although I think there
is general agreement

805
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,639
in the psychology community,

806
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,289
in the psychiatric community
that past a certain age,

807
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,690
the using of one's teeth to
impart aggression and damage

808
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,700
on others is a particularly
primitive and troubling

809
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,110
or at least for the observer
or the person experiencing

810
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,332
is a pretty disturbing event.

811
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:09,030
Dayu's lab has shown that activation

812
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,580
of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers

813
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,280
a downstream circuit in
the periaqueductal gray

814
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,340
which then triggers a whole
other set of circuits of fixed

815
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,173
action patterns.

816
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:20,800
Here we are back to Lorenz
with fixed action patterns,

817
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,330
including swinging of the
limbs, right punching.

818
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,730
And this wouldn't necessarily
be controlled punching,

819
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,363
but also biting behavior.

820
00:35:29,457 --> 00:35:30,290
So it's remarkable to me,

821
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,270
at least that we have circuits
in our brain that can evoke

822
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,310
violent use of things like
our mouth or violent use of

823
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,680
things like our limbs.

824
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,580
That of course could be used
for things like singing or

825
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,920
kissing or eating or, you know,

826
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,163
gesticulating in any kind
of polite or impolite way.

827
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,490
The point here is that neural circuits,

828
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,230
not individual brain areas
evoke the constellation

829
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,450
of behaviors that we call aggression.

830
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,238
Now, many of you are probably
puzzled or at least should be

831
00:35:59,238 --> 00:36:01,280
because I've been talking about

832
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
this highly specialized brain area,

833
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,890
the ventromedial hypothalamus
and this highly specialized

834
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,280
subcategory of neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus,

835
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,950
these neurons that make
estrogen receptors.

836
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,880
And yet the activation of those cells

837
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,610
triggers dramatic and
immediate aggression,

838
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,990
both in males and in females and both

839
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,313
against males and against females.

840
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,640
So what's going on here?

841
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,080
Most of us think about
estrogen and we don't

842
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,540
immediately think of aggression.

843
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,730
Most of us hear testosterone and we might

844
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,010
think about aggression,
although other things as well.

845
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,700
In order to understand this, I
just want to briefly refer back

846
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,120
to a conversation that I had

847
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,270
on a previous episode of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

848
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,950
And that was with my colleague,
the great Robert Sapolsky

849
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,320
of course, is a professor at Stanford

850
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,390
who studied testosterone
and its impacts on behavior

851
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,900
as well as estrogen and other hormones

852
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,400
and their impacts on behavior.

853
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,300
To make a long story short and to dispel

854
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,960
a still unfortunately very common myth.

855
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,964
Testosterone does not
increase aggressiveness,

856
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:09,010
testosterone increases
proactivity and the willingness

857
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,453
to lean into effort in
competitive scenarios.

858
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,880
Sometimes this is referred to
as the challenge hypothesis,

859
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,189
but to make a long story short,

860
00:37:20,189 --> 00:37:22,530
if people are given testosterone,

861
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,610
or if you look at people
who have different levels,

862
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,070
excuse me, of testosterone,

863
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,100
endogenously that they naturally make.

864
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,800
What you'll find is that
testosterone tends to increase

865
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,370
competitiveness, but not
just in aggressive scenarios.

866
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,380
So if somebody is already aggressive,

867
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,760
giving them testosterone
will have the tendency

868
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,210
to make them more aggressive.

869
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,460
If somebody however is very
benevolent and altruistic,

870
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,650
giving them testosterone will
make them more benevolent

871
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,720
and altruistic, at least up to a point.

872
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,280
Now, of course there are certain forms

873
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,280
of synthetic testosterones that
are known in sports circles

874
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,750
and in other circles to
increase aggressiveness

875
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,380
because of the way those particular forms

876
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,120
of synthetic testosterones work.

877
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,600
But in general, most of the experiments

878
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,180
that I'm referring to have
not been done using those,

879
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,740
they've been done using
the let's call them

880
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,320
the more traditional biological
forms of testosterone

881
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,770
or that resemble the biological
forms of testosterone.

882
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,753
In fact, Robert Sapolsky described

883
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:24,170
a really interesting experiment in which,

884
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,480
if you look at testosterone
levels or you administer

885
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,210
additional testosterone to people

886
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,550
who are doing philanthropy,
giving money to organizations

887
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,990
and so they're essentially doing good

888
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,240
because these are
organizations doing good.

889
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,230
What you find is that
increased testosterone

890
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,800
or further increasing
testosterone makes people

891
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,500
more willing to compete,
to give more money

892
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,981
than the other person
in the room in order,

893
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:48,097
you know, to put it in air quotes,

894
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:51,030
"To Alpha out the other
person," by giving more money.

895
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,730
So this is an act of altruistic
or benevolent philanthropy.

896
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,225
It is not an act of aggression.

897
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:58,080
Of course, we don't know what the people

898
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,770
are feeling underneath all that.

899
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,580
Again, we can't
anthropomorphize or project

900
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,120
onto other people what they're feeling.

901
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,427
But the point is that testosterone itself

902
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,853
does not make people more aggressive.

903
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,980
And in the experiments that
we've been talking about

904
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,500
up until now, it's actually the activation

905
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,100
of estrogen receptor containing neurons

906
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,270
that makes these animals more aggressive.

907
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,640
And it turns out there's
evidence that in certain context,

908
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,610
estrogen can make people more aggressive.

909
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,810
So what's going on here?

910
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,380
Well, what's going on is that
testosterone can be converted

911
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,710
into estrogen through a
process called aromatization.

912
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,680
There's an enzyme called aromatase.

913
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,730
Anytime you have word that ends in A-S-E,

914
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,440
at least if it's in
the context of biology,

915
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,380
it's almost always not always,
but almost always an enzyme.

916
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,393
So the aromatase enzyme converts
testosterone into estrogen,

917
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,370
and it is actually
testosterone, aromatized,

918
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,660
converted into estrogen and then binding

919
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,340
to these estrogen containing neurons

920
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,500
in the ventromedial hypothalamus
that triggers aggression.

921
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,980
I want to repeat that, it
is not testosterone itself,

922
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,390
that triggers aggression.

923
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,180
It is testosterone aromatized
into estrogen within the brain

924
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,460
and binding to these estrogen
receptor containing neurons

925
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,820
in the ventromedial hypothalamus
that evokes aggression

926
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,150
and dramatic aggression at that.

927
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,700
Now this effect of estrogen
causing aggression in the brain

928
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,920
is very robust, so much so
that if you take a mouse

929
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,620
that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human

930
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,423
that lacks the aromatase
enzyme, and they do exist,

931
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,930
then there is a reduction
in overall aggression,

932
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,990
despite high levels of testosterone.

933
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:47,990
And if people who or mice who
have the aromatase enzyme have

934
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,690
that enzyme blocked, well,
then it doesn't matter

935
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,520
how much you increase testosterone

936
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,480
or any of its other derivatives.

937
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,700
You do not observe this aggression.

938
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,430
So this runs counter to
everything that we know and think

939
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,320
about the role of testosterone.

940
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,400
Again, testosterone
increases competitiveness.

941
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,830
It can increase the desire
to work under challenge.

942
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,670
I've said it before, and I ran this

943
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,510
or pressure tested this
against Robert Sapolsky

944
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,380
who's been working on
testosterone and it's role

945
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,045
in the brain and behavior
for many decades now.

946
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:25,045
It is fair to say that
testosterone has the net effect

947
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,640
of making effort feel good,
or at least increasing

948
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,890
the threshold at which effort
feels bad or unsustainable.

949
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,520
And it does that by way
of changing the activity

950
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,010
or the threshold for
activation of brain structures,

951
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,800
like the amygdala and
other brain structures

952
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,830
associated with anxiety.

953
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,520
So the next time somebody says,

954
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,160
testosterone makes people aggressive.

955
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,900
You can say, "Ah, no,
actually it's estrogen

956
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,440
that makes people aggressive,
and animals aggressive

957
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,573
for that matter.

958
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:57,740
Now of course it is the
case that because males

959
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,960
have relatively less estrogen circulating

960
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,260
in their brain and body
than females, right?

961
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,415
Because they have testes, not ovaries,

962
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:09,480
that testosterone is
required in the first place

963
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,360
in order to be converted into estrogen,

964
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,240
to activate this aggressive
circuit involving

965
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,180
these estrogen receptor containing neurons

966
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,910
in the ventromedial hypothalamus.

967
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,910
But nonetheless, it is estrogen
that is the final step.

968
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,470
It is the hormone on
which aggression hinges.

969
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,750
And I think for most people,

970
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,660
that's a quite surprising finding.

971
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,380
And yet this is perhaps one
of the more robust findings

972
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,070
in both the animal and human
literature, as it relates

973
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,600
to hormones and psychological
states and behavior.

974
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,630
Now, of course it is the case
that if testosterone is low,

975
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,810
that a person or an animal will exhibit

976
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,680
less aggressive behavior, but that's not

977
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,440
because of reduced testosterone per se.

978
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,477
It's because of the subsequent
reduction in testosterone,

979
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:58,110
meaning if there's no
testosterone to aromatize

980
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,430
into estrogen, estrogen
will also be lower.

981
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,380
So we've established that
it's not testosterone,

982
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,970
but testosterone converted into estrogen

983
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,700
that activates these
circuits for aggression.

984
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,110
But nonetheless, it's
still surprising, right?

985
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,600
I mean, most of us don't
think about estrogen

986
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,510
as the hormone that stimulates aggression,

987
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,360
but it turns out it's all contextual.

988
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,780
There are beautiful data
showing that whether or not

989
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,660
estrogen stimulates aggression,
can be powerfully modulated

990
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,810
by whether or not days are
short or days are long.

991
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,384
In other words, whether or not

992
00:43:33,384 --> 00:43:35,320
here's a lot of sunshine or not.

993
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,850
Now, obviously brain is encased in skull.

994
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,390
So it doesn't really know
if there's a lot of sunshine

995
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,210
out there even though you can
see the sun with your eyes,

996
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,879
you can feel it on your skin.

997
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:49,930
Day length is converted
into hormonal signals

998
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:51,940
and chemical signals
and the primary hormonal

999
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,650
and chemical signals involve
melatonin and dopamine

1000
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,780
and also the stress hormones.

1001
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,740
So to make a very long story short,

1002
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,890
in the long days where
we get a lot of sunlight,

1003
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,360
both in our eyes and on our skin,

1004
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,040
melatonin levels are reduced.

1005
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,240
Melatonin is a hormone
that tends to produce

1006
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,610
states of sleepiness and quiescence.

1007
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,538
It also tends to activate
pathways that tend to reduce

1008
00:44:13,538 --> 00:44:16,610
things like breeding and sexual behavior.

1009
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,140
In long days, dopamine is increased.

1010
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,540
Dopamine is a molecule associated
with feelings of wellbeing

1011
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,790
and motivation and the desire to seek out

1012
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,230
all sorts of things, all
sorts of motivated behaviors.

1013
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,110
And in long days provided
we're getting enough sunlight

1014
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,970
on our skin and to our
eyes, the stress hormones,

1015
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,070
especially cortisol, and some of the other

1016
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,970
stress hormones are reduced in levels.

1017
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,810
If estrogen levels are
increased experimentally

1018
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,020
under long day conditions,
it does not evoke aggression.

1019
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,330
However, in short days,
if estrogen is increased,

1020
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,283
there's a heightened
predisposition for aggression.

1021
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,440
And that makes perfect sense.

1022
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,410
If you think about what short days do

1023
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,530
to the biology of your brain and body.

1024
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,350
In short days, the
melatonin signal goes up.

1025
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,780
There's more melatonin circulating

1026
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,733
for more of each 24 hour cycle.

1027
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,490
Stress hormones are circulating more.

1028
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,280
Why? Short days tend to
be associated with winter.

1029
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,540
In winter, we are bombarded
with more bacterial viruses

1030
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,320
because bacterial viruses actually survive

1031
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,640
better in cold than they do in heat.

1032
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,030
In fact, in my laboratory, we work with

1033
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,800
a lot of viruses and
bacteria and when we want

1034
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,640
to keep them alive, we
put them in the freezer.

1035
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,630
If we want to kill them, if
we want to inoculate them,

1036
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,140
we put them under UV light.

1037
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,770
Like you would see from the sunlight.

1038
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,730
So shorter days are
conducive to aggression.

1039
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,660
Not because days are short per se,

1040
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,810
but because stress
hormone levels are higher

1041
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,570
and because dopamine levels are lower.

1042
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,940
Now, here's where all of
this starts to converge

1043
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,370
on a very clear biological picture,

1044
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,900
a very clear psychological
picture, and indeed

1045
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,623
a very clear set of tools that
we can think about and use.

1046
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,410
Under conditions where cortisol is high,

1047
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:05,410
where this stress hormone is
elevated and under conditions

1048
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,880
where the neuromodulator
serotonin is reduced

1049
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,770
there is a greater propensity for estrogen

1050
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,053
to trigger aggression.

1051
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,530
Now, again, I know I've said it before,

1052
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,700
but for males who make
a lot of testosterone

1053
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,910
relative to estrogen, you
have to swap in your mind

1054
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,410
this idea that if testosterone is high,

1055
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,820
that means that estrogen is low because

1056
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,410
while that can be true in
the periphery in the body,

1057
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,050
if testosterone is high,
there is going to be

1058
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,230
some aromatization, that conversion of

1059
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,290
testosterone to estrogen.

1060
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,560
So anytime you hear that
testosterone is high,

1061
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,210
you should think testosterone
is high in the body

1062
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,790
and perhaps estrogen is low in the body.

1063
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,470
But that means that there's
going to be heightened levels

1064
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,640
of estrogen in the brain and therefore

1065
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,102
increased propensity for aggression.

1066
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:54,580
In females who generally
make less testosterone

1067
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:59,070
relative to estrogen, there
is sufficient estrogen

1068
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,261
already present to trigger aggression.

1069
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:06,261
So both males and females
are primed for aggression,

1070
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,430
but that's riding on a
context and that context

1071
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,910
of whether or not you get a
tendency for aggression or not.

1072
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,360
depends on whether or not
cortisol is high or low,

1073
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,800
and I'm telling you that if
cortisol is relatively higher

1074
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,860
in any individual, there's
going to be a tilt,

1075
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,420
an increase in that hydraulic
pressure that Lorenz talked

1076
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,463
about toward aggression.

1077
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:34,300
And if serotonin, the
neuromodulator that is associated

1078
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,560
with feelings of wellbeing and sometimes

1079
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,836
even of slight passivity,
but certainly of wellbeing,

1080
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:43,660
if serotonin is low, there's
also going to be a further shift

1081
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,330
towards an aggressive tendency.

1082
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,120
So if we return to Lorenz's
hydraulic pressure model

1083
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,560
of aggression in other internal states,

1084
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,760
we realize that external
stimuli, things that we hear,

1085
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,370
things that we see, for instance,

1086
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,340
someone saying something upsetting or us,

1087
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,870
seeing somebody do something
that we don't like to others

1088
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,950
or to us, as well as our internal state,

1089
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,070
our subjective feelings of wellbeing,

1090
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,440
but also our stress level,

1091
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,017
our feelings of whether or
not we have enough resources

1092
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,160
and are content with what we have.

1093
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,900
All of that is converging on this thing

1094
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,680
that we call internal state and creating

1095
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,920
this pressure of either to be

1096
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,710
more aggressive or less aggressive.

1097
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,560
And now we have some major players feeding

1098
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,130
into that final pathway.

1099
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,400
That question of whether or not

1100
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,910
will we hit the other,
person, will we say the thing

1101
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,844
that is considered aggressive?

1102
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:36,670
Will we not say it?

1103
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,270
If somebody says something
or does something

1104
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,360
aggressive to us, will
we respond or will we be

1105
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,550
submissive or even passive?

1106
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:46,670
Again, there are many things
funneling into that question

1107
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,127
and dictating whether
or not the answer is,

1108
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,570
"Absolutely I'll fight back,"

1109
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,950
or, "I'm going to attack
them even unprovoked."

1110
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,441
Or if they say this, I'm going to do that,

1111
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:57,150
or no matter what they do,
I'm not going to respond.

1112
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,070
These kinds of things are very complex.

1113
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,010
And yet we really can boil them down

1114
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,610
to just a few common elements.

1115
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,230
And I'm telling you that those
elements are whether or not

1116
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,470
cortisol levels are relatively
lower or relatively higher.

1117
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,320
Again, relatively higher is going to tend

1118
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,750
to make people more reactive.

1119
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,710
Why?

1120
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,140
Because reactivity is really a function

1121
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,970
of the autonomic nervous system,

1122
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,090
which is sort of like a
seesaw that oscillates

1123
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,130
between the so-called sympathetic arm

1124
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,190
of the autonomic nervous system,

1125
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,200
which tends to put us
into a state of readiness

1126
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,720
through the release of adrenaline.

1127
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,710
Cortisol and adrenaline
when they're circulating

1128
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,180
the brain and body, make
us more likely to move

1129
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,800
and to react and to speak.

1130
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,330
It's actually what will induce
a kind of low level tremor,

1131
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,230
which is an anticipatory tremor to be able

1132
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,870
to move more quickly, right?

1133
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,050
A body in motion is more
easily set into further motion,

1134
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,536
that is, and the neuromodulator serotonin

1135
00:49:48,536 --> 00:49:52,740
is a neuromodulator that
in general is associated

1136
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,410
with feelings of wellbeing in response

1137
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,440
to what we already have.

1138
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,300
So when we are well fed,

1139
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,530
serotonin tends to be released
in our brain and body,

1140
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,600
in particular, well
fed with carbohydrates,

1141
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,380
the precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.

1142
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,420
And indeed there are nice studies

1143
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,430
exploring the types of
diets, nutritional programs

1144
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,050
that can reduce aggressive
behavior, both in children

1145
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,900
and in adults and tryptophan-rich diets

1146
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,800
or supplementation with tryptophan.

1147
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,760
So for tryptophan rich diets,

1148
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,280
things like white turkey meat,

1149
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,940
but then there are also
a number of carbohydrates

1150
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,870
you can look up.

1151
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:28,930
It's very easy to find foods

1152
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,430
that contain lots of tryptophan.

1153
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:34,960
Those foods contain the
precursor to serotonin.

1154
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,170
Now it isn't simply the
case that eating more foods

1155
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,010
with tryptophan will tend
to reduce your aggression.

1156
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,810
I suppose it could do that,
if you ate it in abundance,

1157
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,610
it could make you tired
and then you're less likely

1158
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,750
to be aggressive, I don't
recommend that strategy,

1159
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,730
but the idea here is that
when it's been explored,

1160
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,570
increasing levels of tryptophan
either by supplementation

1161
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,790
or by food or drugs, prescription drugs

1162
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,150
that increase serotonin.

1163
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,282
So for instance, fluoxetine
sometimes called Prozac

1164
00:51:01,282 --> 00:51:03,920
or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs

1165
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,790
tend to reduce aggressive behavior.

1166
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,950
Now, not always, but in
general, that's the case.

1167
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,590
Similarly, because elevated cortisol tends

1168
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:14,050
to shift the whole
system, again, create more

1169
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,590
of a hydraulic pressure
towards aggressive states.

1170
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,970
If cortisol levels are
reduced, well then the tendency

1171
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:21,850
for aggressive behavior is reduced.

1172
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,110
This is supported by a number
of peer reviewed studies.

1173
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,410
We'll provide links to some of those

1174
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:26,720
in the caption show notes.

1175
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,480
And we're going to return to
these a bit later in the context

1176
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,329
of specific studies that have
looked at genetic variants

1177
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:36,080
in different individuals that cause them

1178
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,150
to make more or less serotonin,

1179
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,660
or at least to metabolize
serotonin differently.

1180
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,750
This is also the case for so-called

1181
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,730
intermittent explosive disorder
that can often be associated

1182
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:51,730
with gene variants that control
how much serotonin is made

1183
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,600
or how it's metabolized or
how much cortisol is made

1184
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,490
and how much it's metabolized.

1185
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,290
In thinking about tools
that are a number of things

1186
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,200
that one could consider.

1187
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,050
First of all, there are a
number of decent studies

1188
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,650
exploring how supplementation
with the Omega-3 fatty acids,

1189
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:11,135
which are precursors of some
of the transmitter systems,

1190
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:16,010
including serotonin that can
modulate not directly mediate,

1191
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,547
but modulate mood and emotional
tone supplementation with

1192
00:52:19,547 --> 00:52:22,670
the omega 3 S has been shown
to reduce impulsivity and

1193
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,580
aggressiveness in certain
contexts in things like ADHD

1194
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,210
or in individuals who
have a predisposition

1195
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,420
for aggressive type behavior
or aggressive thinking.

1196
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,980
Now that doesn't necessarily
mean that the omega 3

1197
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,210
fatty acids are going directly

1198
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,660
to the ventromedial hypothalamus
and changing the activity

1199
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,980
of neurons there more likely they are

1200
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,090
causing or modulating
an overall shift in mood

1201
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:50,210
through the immune system,
through hormone systems that are

1202
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,660
changing the overall tone or
the propensity for neurons

1203
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,920
in the ventromedial
hypothalamus to be activated.

1204
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,060
How much omega 3 fatty acid, what source?

1205
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,082
Well, we've talked about
this on the podcast before.

1206
00:53:01,082 --> 00:53:03,340
You can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids

1207
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,480
from a number of different foods.

1208
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,940
Getting them from whole foods
is probably the best way

1209
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,100
to do it, but many people,
including people with depression

1210
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,650
will often supplement
with one gram or more

1211
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,580
of omega 3 fatty acid per day.

1212
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,639
Some people including myself
will take them every day

1213
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,110
as just a general mood enhancer.

1214
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,270
I don't suffer from depression,

1215
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,460
but I've found it be
beneficial for my health.

1216
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,780
And so some people do that,
and I've talked about before,

1217
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,900
how in double blind
placebo controlled studies,

1218
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,810
people taking one to three
grams of omega 3 fatty acids

1219
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,080
per day, typically in the form
of a high quality fish oil,

1220
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,830
although there are other sources as well,

1221
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,500
algae and so forth, can
experience improvements in mood

1222
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,060
that are on par with some of the SSRIs,

1223
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,980
the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors.

1224
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,780
And of course, if you're
prescribed an SSRI

1225
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,220
by your psychiatrist or other
doctor, please do take that

1226
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,330
and don't cease to take it
just simply to take omega 3s.

1227
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,840
However you might mention to
them, and you can find links

1228
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,450
to the studies in our previous
episodes on depression

1229
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:01,810
that supplementation
with omega 3 fatty acids

1230
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:05,120
of at this one gram or
more of EPA specifically,

1231
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,850
so getting above that one gram threshold,

1232
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:11,660
as high as three grams per day
of the EPA has allowed people

1233
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,060
to take lower doses of SSRIs
and still keep their mood

1234
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,200
in a place that's beneficial for them.

1235
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,440
And in terms of keeping cortisol
in a range that's healthy

1236
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,940
and doesn't bias someone toward
high levels of aggression

1237
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,810
and irritability, that's
again, going to be set

1238
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,190
by a number of larger
modulators or contextual cues.

1239
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,810
And I've talked about some
of those on the podcast,

1240
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,980
but I'll just briefly recap them now,

1241
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,030
obviously getting sunlight in
your eyes early in the day,

1242
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,120
and as much sunlight as
you safely can in your eyes

1243
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,160
throughout the day is
going to be important.

1244
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,490
Again, because of this effect
of estrogen in long days,

1245
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,010
not increasing aggression,
however, in shorter days,

1246
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,140
estrogen increases aggression
because of the increase

1247
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,820
in cortisol observed in short days.

1248
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,490
Another way to reduce cortisol
was discussed in our episode

1249
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:04,860
on heat and the use of sauna
and heat, but also hot baths.

1250
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,430
It turns out that hot baths and sauna

1251
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,640
can be very beneficial
for reducing cortisol.

1252
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,880
All the details on that are
included in the episode on heat

1253
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,150
and it's timestamped, so
you can go directly to that

1254
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,570
if you want to learn
about the temperatures

1255
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,890
and the various durations,
but to just give

1256
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:22,890
a synopsis of that, a 20
minute sauna at anywhere

1257
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,560
from 80 to a hundred degrees
Celsius is going to be

1258
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,570
beneficial for reducing cortisol.

1259
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,330
If you don't have access to a sauna,

1260
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,880
you could do a hot bath,
adjust the temperature

1261
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,860
so you don't burn yourself.

1262
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,720
I think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius

1263
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,080
is going to be too hot for many people

1264
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,660
if it's a hot bath, whereas
many people who can't tolerate

1265
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,220
that hot bath can tolerate the sauna.

1266
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,040
So safety first always, and of course,

1267
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:51,040
but hot baths reduce cortisol,
hot saunas, reduce cortisol

1268
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,460
of a duration about 20 or 30
minutes is going to be beneficial.

1269
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,510
And of course, some of you
may be interested in exploring

1270
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,250
the supplementation route and
for reductions in cortisol,

1271
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:03,210
really the chief player
there is ashwagandha,

1272
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,850
which is known to decrease
cortisol, fairly potently.

1273
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,570
I should just warn you
that if you're going to use

1274
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:12,010
ashwagandha in order to
reduce cortisol, first of all,

1275
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,840
check with your doctor
or healthcare provider

1276
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,570
before adding or subtracting anything

1277
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,410
from your supplementation
or health regimen.

1278
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,030
Of course, I don't just
say that to protect us.

1279
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,330
I say that to protect you,

1280
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:22,238
you are responsible for your health,

1281
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:24,030
what you take and what you don't take.

1282
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,300
Chronic supplementation with
ashwagandha can have some

1283
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,580
not so great effects of disruption
of other hormone pathways

1284
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,100
and neurotransmitter pathways.

1285
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,580
So the limit seems to be
about two weeks of regular use

1286
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,340
before you'd want to take
a break of about two weeks.

1287
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,960
So ashwagandha again, a very
potent inhibitor of cortisol,

1288
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,676
but with some other effects as well,

1289
00:56:44,676 --> 00:56:47,430
don't use it chronically
for longer than two weeks.

1290
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,500
But if your goal is to reduce cortisol,

1291
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,720
let's say you're going
through a period of increased

1292
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,760
irritability and aggressive tendency,

1293
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,440
maybe you're also not
getting as much light

1294
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,120
as you would like, and
perhaps also, if there are

1295
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,740
other circumstantial
things leading you towards

1296
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,550
more aggressiveness and
your goal is to reduce

1297
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,200
aggressiveness, that can
be potentially helpful.

1298
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,708
And in light of all this stuff
about cortisol and estrogen

1299
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:13,220
and day length, I should
mention that there are in fact,

1300
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,250
some people who have a
genetic predisposition

1301
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:19,567
to be more irritable and aggressive,

1302
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:21,950
and there are a couple of
different gene pathways

1303
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,130
associated with this.

1304
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,380
We never like to think about just one gene

1305
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,157
causing a specific behavior.

1306
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:30,660
The way to think about genes
is that genes generally code

1307
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,670
for things within our biology.

1308
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,950
In the context of today's
discussion, things like

1309
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:38,810
neural circuits or the
amounts of neurotransmitters

1310
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,770
that are made, or the amounts
of hormones that are made,

1311
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,360
or the amount of neurotransmitter
hormone receptors

1312
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,160
or enzymes, et cetera,
that shift the activity

1313
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,470
of our biology in a particular direction.

1314
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,660
They bias our biology.

1315
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,940
And in fact, there is a
genetic variant present

1316
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,100
in certain people that adjusts

1317
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,640
their estrogen receptor sensitivity,

1318
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,830
and that estrogen receptor
sensitivity can result

1319
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,027
in increased levels of aggression,

1320
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:11,510
sometimes dramatic increases, however,

1321
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:14,090
and also very interestingly, photo period,

1322
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,860
meaning day length, is a strong
modulator of whether or not

1323
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,960
that aggressiveness turns up or not.

1324
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,120
Whether or not that person with
the particular gene variant

1325
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,750
is more aggressive or not,
depends on how long the day is

1326
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,330
and how long the night is.

1327
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,779
One particular study that
I like that references this

1328
00:58:32,779 --> 00:58:35,617
is Trainer, et al, the
title of the study is

1329
00:58:35,617 --> 00:58:38,220
"Photo period reverses
the effects of estrogens

1330
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,700
on male aggression, via genomic
and non-genomic pathways."

1331
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,560
This was a paper published
in the proceedings

1332
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,380
of the National Academy of Sciences.

1333
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,560
We'll put a reference to
this in the show notes,

1334
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,270
if you'd like to explore it further,

1335
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:53,410
but it really points to the
fact that rarely, sometimes,

1336
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,970
but rarely, is it the
case that just one gene

1337
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,373
will cause somebody to
be hyper aggressive.

1338
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,270
Almost always there's
going to be an interplay

1339
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:05,760
between genetics and environment
and as environment changes

1340
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,560
such as day length changes and
the length of night changes,

1341
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,690
so too, will the tendency for people

1342
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,650
with a given genetic variant
to be more aggressive or not.

1343
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,380
Now, of course, in the absence
of detailed genetic testing

1344
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,500
for this particular
estrogen receptor variant,

1345
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,530
most people, I'm guessing
you, are probably

1346
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,923
not walking around knowing
that you have this gene or not.

1347
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,850
Regardless, I think it's
important to pay attention

1348
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:31,170
to how you feel at
different times of year,

1349
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,080
depending on whether or not summer,

1350
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,913
whether or not it's winter,

1351
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,682
whether or not you're
getting sufficient sunlight,

1352
00:59:35,682 --> 00:59:38,190
meaning viewing sufficient
sunlight or not,

1353
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:40,190
whether or not you're getting
sufficient sunlight exposure

1354
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,680
to your skin or not, whether or not

1355
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,940
you're indoors all the time.

1356
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,330
Generally those things
correlate with season,

1357
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:47,570
but not always.

1358
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,280
You can go through long bouts of hard work

1359
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,940
in the summer months when days are long,

1360
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,110
but you're indoors a lot and
getting a lot of fluorescent

1361
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,450
light exposure late in the evening.

1362
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,690
And perhaps that's when you're
feeling more aggressive.

1363
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,810
So we have to be careful
about drawing a one-to-one

1364
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,500
relationship between
any biological feature

1365
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,940
and certainly psychological
or behavioral feature

1366
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,770
like aggressiveness, but
it's, I believe, helpful

1367
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,070
to know that these genetic biases exist,

1368
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,430
how they play out again,
they shift our biology

1369
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,690
in a general thematic direction.

1370
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,780
They don't change one thing.

1371
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,400
They change a variety of things
that bias us toward or away

1372
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,150
from certain psychological
and behavioral outcomes

1373
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,730
and the various things that we can do

1374
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,007
in order to offset them.

1375
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,950
And we described those
earlier in terms of trying

1376
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,140
to keep cortisol low by
getting sufficient sunlight

1377
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,390
regardless of time of year, and
regardless of whether or not

1378
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:36,730
you happen to have this
particular genetic variant.

1379
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,250
So earlier I talked about
how it is testosterone

1380
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,230
converted into estrogen
that's activating aggression

1381
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,560
in the ventromedial hypothalamus,
not testosterone itself.

1382
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,143
However, there are some
studies carried out in humans

1383
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:51,340
that have evaluated the
effects of testosterone

1384
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,500
and how levels of testosterone
correlate with aggressiveness

1385
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,240
in the short term.

1386
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm just going to detail
a few of those studies

1387
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,023
because I think they are
interesting and important.

1388
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,130
First of all, there is a
study that has explored

1389
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:09,080
levels of testosterone in
men of different professions.

1390
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,500
Now, before I tell you the data,

1391
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,730
I want to be very clear here,
with a study such as this,

1392
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,310
one never knows whether or not these men

1393
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,530
went into a particular profession because

1394
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:24,020
they had a testosterone
level of a given value

1395
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,450
or whether or not the work itself

1396
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:30,340
altered their testosterone levels or both.

1397
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:34,360
And I think it's fair to
assume that it's probably both.

1398
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,270
So be very careful in assuming
that a given testosterone

1399
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,410
level is causal for
choosing a particular career

1400
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,165
or that a particular career is causal

1401
01:01:43,165 --> 01:01:46,300
for creating a particular
testosterone level.

1402
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,510
This study used salivary
testosterone levels

1403
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:53,460
as the measure, which to
be fair is not the best way

1404
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,300
to measure testosterone.

1405
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,210
Typically blood draw would be the best way

1406
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,900
to measure testosterone,
but nonetheless, provided

1407
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,880
the appropriate methods are
used, salivary testosterone

1408
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,860
can be a reasonable
measure of testosterone.

1409
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:09,740
The different occupations
that were looked at were,

1410
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,480
and here they just looked at
men in this particular study

1411
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,020
were ministers, salesmen, they didn't say

1412
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,420
what particular types
of salesmen, firemen,

1413
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:21,770
professors, of all things,
physicians and NFL players.

1414
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:26,350
And what they discovered was
that the testosterone levels

1415
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,430
were essentially in that
order from low to highest.

1416
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,180
So minister, salesman, fireman,

1417
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,040
professor, physician, NFL player.

1418
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,550
Now we could micro dissect
all the different stereotypes

1419
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,350
and all the different features
of each of these jobs.

1420
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,320
For instance, we don't know
whether or not the fact

1421
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,190
that the firemen happened,
at least in this study

1422
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:49,690
to have lower testosterone
levels on average

1423
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:51,630
than the professors or the physicians

1424
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,060
was because firemen have
lower testosterone levels

1425
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,010
or because they have a
much more stressful job

1426
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:59,700
and their cortisol levels
are higher than the professor

1427
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,530
or the physician and cortisol
and testosterone, not always,

1428
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:07,730
but generally are in somewhat
antagonistic push-pull mode

1429
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:09,770
because they derive from the
same precursor, et cetera.

1430
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,210
Typically, when cortisol is high,

1431
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:13,974
testosterone tends to
be lower and vice versa.

1432
01:03:13,974 --> 01:03:16,856
So we don't know what's
causing these effects.

1433
01:03:16,856 --> 01:03:20,722
And again, this is just one
study and just six occupations,

1434
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:23,230
but I think it's relatively
interesting given the fact

1435
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,230
that each of these professions
involves different levels

1436
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,420
of competitiveness, right?

1437
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,150
So we don't necessarily
just want to think about

1438
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:32,540
the level of physical
exertion that's required,

1439
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,040
but also the level of
competitiveness because it's known

1440
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,970
that competitive interactions
can cause increases

1441
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:41,700
in testosterone, in
particular, in the winners

1442
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,300
of competitive interactions,
a topic for a future podcast.

1443
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,020
Meanwhile, studies that
have analyzed also again,

1444
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:53,730
salivary testosterone in
prisoners, in this case,

1445
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,440
female prisoners, so these
are incarcerated individuals,

1446
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,780
have looked at levels of testosterone

1447
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:02,660
according to whether or
not the person committed

1448
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,050
a non-violent or a violent crime in order

1449
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,320
to arrive in prison.

1450
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,930
And higher levels of salivary
testosterone were related

1451
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,820
to those that had arrived in prison

1452
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,790
because of conviction of a violent crime,

1453
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,630
as opposed to a nonviolent crime.

1454
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,830
Likewise, when they analyzed
prison rule violations,

1455
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,990
so an indirect measure of
aggressiveness, but in this case,

1456
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,310
it was strongly associated
with aggressiveness

1457
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,300
because they knew what
the violations were,

1458
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,090
they found were for
prisoners that had none,

1459
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:36,340
no prison violations, prison
rule violations I should say,

1460
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,560
their testosterone
levels tended to be lower

1461
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,890
than the testosterone levels
of women that had some,

1462
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:47,890
even one, or more aggressive
violations of prison rules.

1463
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,470
We'll provide links to these
studies in the show notes

1464
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,520
if you'd like to go into them further,

1465
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,380
obviously studies like
this need to be taken

1466
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,730
with a grain of salt
because there are so many

1467
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,960
different factors, different
prisons have different degrees

1468
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,490
of violence to begin with and
competitiveness to begin with.

1469
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,020
But just as a final pass
at examining the role

1470
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,001
between testosterone and aggressiveness,

1471
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:13,703
there was a very interesting
study from Goetz, et al,

1472
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:18,533
G-O-E-T-Z published in
2014, that looked at serum,

1473
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,670
so in this case, blood
levels of testosterone.

1474
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:26,650
30 minutes after application
of a gel-based testosterone

1475
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,820
that goes transdermal
so that the testosterone

1476
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,540
can go very quickly into the bloodstream,

1477
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,514
and then did brain imaging
to evaluate the activity

1478
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:38,910
of neurons in the so-called
corticomedial amygdala,

1479
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:41,580
the cortico, the medial
amygdala is one of the areas

1480
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,500
of the amygdala complex as we
call it because it's complex,

1481
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,250
it's got a lot of different nuclei,

1482
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,290
you know, know what nuclei
are, low clusters of neurons.

1483
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,900
It's got a lot of different
ones, but that medial

1484
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,010
and that cortico medial
amygdala in particular,

1485
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:57,300
is known to be associated with
aggressive type behaviors.

1486
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,180
It's linked up with as part
of the larger circuit that

1487
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,610
includes the ventromedial
hypothalamus and other brain areas

1488
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,833
that we referred to
earlier, such as the PAG.

1489
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:10,470
What is remarkable about this
study is that it showed that

1490
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,810
just 30 minutes after
application of this so-called

1491
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,810
AndroGel, this testosterone that seeps

1492
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,390
into the bloodstream,
there was a significant

1493
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:21,160
increase in of course, testosterone

1494
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,410
and corticomedial amygdala activation.

1495
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,950
So testosterone can have acute effects,

1496
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,270
immediate effects on the
pathways related to aggression.

1497
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:33,640
And I think this is something
that's not often discussed

1498
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,320
because many of the
effects of steroid hormones

1499
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,670
like testosterone, and
estrogen are very slow acting.

1500
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:42,660
In fact, steroid hormones,
because they have a certain

1501
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,670
biochemical composition can actually pass

1502
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:47,220
through the membranes of
cells, so the outside of a cell

1503
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,710
and into the nucleus of the cell

1504
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,720
and change gene expression in the cell,

1505
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,320
you think about puberty,
the kid that goes home

1506
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,810
for the summer and then comes back

1507
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,150
looking completely different.

1508
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,280
Well that's because of a
lot of genes got turned on

1509
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,740
by steroid hormones like
testosterone and estrogen,

1510
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,530
but the steroid hormones can also

1511
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:06,440
have very fast acting
effects and with testosterone

1512
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,910
in particular, those can
be remarkably fast acting

1513
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:12,240
and one of the most apparent
and well documented fast acting

1514
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,430
effects is this effect: the
ability to activate cells within

1515
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,727
the amygdala, so you might say,

1516
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:18,790
"Well, I thought the amygdala
was associated with fear?"

1517
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,240
Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No.

1518
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,050
Turns out that the amygdala
harbors, both cortisol,

1519
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,880
corticosteroid receptors
and testosterone receptors,

1520
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,870
and they each adjust the activity

1521
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:31,680
in the amygdala differently,

1522
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,170
such that testosterone tends
to activate amygdala circuitry

1523
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:40,120
for inducing states of mind and body

1524
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,060
that are more action based
and indeed in animals

1525
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,880
and in humans, testosterone
application and activation

1526
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,800
of this corticomedial amygdala pathway

1527
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,130
will make animals and
humans lean into effort.

1528
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,560
This is why I say testosterone
makes effort feel good,

1529
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,680
or at least biases the organism

1530
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,370
toward leaning into challenge.

1531
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:59,700
So if you recall, there's not
just one type of aggression,

1532
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
there's reactive aggression,

1533
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,530
which is triggered when one
is confronted with something

1534
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,640
that sometimes is inevitable, right?

1535
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,990
One needs to fight for their life

1536
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:12,380
or for somebody else's life,
but also proactive aggression

1537
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,800
and proactive aggression
involves activation

1538
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,925
of those go-pathways in the basal ganglia

1539
01:08:16,925 --> 01:08:19,130
and a leaning into effort to overcome

1540
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,069
whatever state one happens
to be in to begin with.

1541
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:24,589
And so this is very important
because it points to the fact

1542
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:28,069
that yes, estrogen is
activating aggression pathways

1543
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:30,630
that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,

1544
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:33,750
but it's very likely the case
that testosterone is acting

1545
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:38,140
to accelerate or to bias
states of mind and body

1546
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,590
toward those that will lead to aggression.

1547
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:43,180
Again, aggression is not
like a switch, on and off.

1548
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,069
It's a process.

1549
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:46,649
It has a beginning, a middle and an end.

1550
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:48,349
Remember that hydraulic pressure

1551
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,000
that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?

1552
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,042
Well, think of testosterone
as increasing the pressure

1553
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:58,430
toward an aggressive
episode and then estrogen

1554
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,660
actually triggering
that aggressive episode

1555
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,439
in the ventromedial hypothalamus.

1556
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:05,019
So if somebody tells
you that testosterone,

1557
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,810
endogenous or exogenous
makes people aggressive,

1558
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,760
tell them no, testosterone tends to make

1559
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,160
people lean into effort.

1560
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,390
And if that effort
involves being aggressive,

1561
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:20,319
either reactively aggressive
or proactively aggressive,

1562
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,699
well then it will indeed
lead to aggression.

1563
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,140
But the actual aggression
itself is triggered by estrogen,

1564
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,430
not testosterone.

1565
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,171
Now, thus far, we really
haven't talked too much

1566
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:34,689
about the social context
in which aggression occurs.

1567
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:36,539
And that's because there
is a near infinite,

1568
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,023
if not infinite number of variables

1569
01:09:39,023 --> 01:09:40,370
that will determine that.

1570
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:43,673
So for instance, violent
aggression is entirely appropriate

1571
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:46,630
at a professional boxing match provided

1572
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,710
it's occurring inside the ring and only

1573
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:51,536
between the competitors
and within the bounds

1574
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:55,800
of the rules of the sport, et cetera.

1575
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,780
However, there are some
things that tend to bias

1576
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,420
certain social context
toward being more aggressive

1577
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,500
or less aggressive and not
always physical aggression.

1578
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,300
And those generally come in two forms

1579
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,610
that many of you are familiar with,

1580
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:12,484
which are alcohol and caffeine.

1581
01:10:12,484 --> 01:10:15,060
Let's discuss caffeine first.

1582
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,330
Why would caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity?

1583
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:20,420
Well, the general effects of caffeine

1584
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,230
are to increase autonomic arousal.

1585
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:25,150
The activity of the
so-called sympathetic arm

1586
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,880
of the autonomic nervous system,

1587
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,720
which is to put it very
much in plain language

1588
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,400
it's the alertness arm
of your nervous system.

1589
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,150
That is, it creates a sense of readiness

1590
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,040
in your brain and body and
it does so by activating

1591
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,890
the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.

1592
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:43,310
Again, as I always remind people,

1593
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:46,710
simpa and sympathetic
does not mean sympathy.

1594
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,720
Simpa means together, we're all at ones.

1595
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,220
And caffeine tends to
bias our brain and body

1596
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:57,370
to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,

1597
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,550
which run from about the base of your neck

1598
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:03,320
until the top of your pelvis
and deploy a bunch of chemicals

1599
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,900
that jut out into the rest of your body,

1600
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,119
activate adrenaline release.

1601
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:10,180
There's a parallel increase in
of adrenaline in your brain,

1602
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,104
creating the state of
alertness and readiness.

1603
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:14,270
That state of alertness
and readiness can be

1604
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,930
for all sorts of things,
not just aggression.

1605
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:19,900
However when we are in
a state of increased

1606
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,284
sympathetic tone, meaning more alert,

1607
01:11:22,284 --> 01:11:24,546
such as after drinking caffeine,

1608
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:29,060
we will bias all those brain
and body systems, the hormones,

1609
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,320
the chemicals, et cetera that exist,

1610
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,400
toward action as opposed to inaction.

1611
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,880
So put simply, caffeine
can increase impulsivity,

1612
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,063
no surprise there.

1613
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,719
On the opposite end of things,
alcohol tends to decrease

1614
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,740
activity in the sympathetic
arm of the autonomic

1615
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:50,060
nervous system, tends to
make us feel less alert.

1616
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,620
Now, initially it can
create a state of alertness

1617
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,220
because of its effects in
inhibiting the forebrain,

1618
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,715
our forebrain prefrontal
cortex in particular

1619
01:11:57,715 --> 01:11:59,960
has what's called top-down inhibition.

1620
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,090
It exerts a inhibitory
or a quieting effect

1621
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:05,880
on some of the circuits
of the hypothalamus,

1622
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,060
such as the ventromedial hypothalamus.

1623
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,160
The way to conceptualize
this is that your forebrain

1624
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,490
is able to rationalize and think clearly

1625
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,970
and to suppress behavior and
to engage the no-go pathways

1626
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,437
telling you, "Don't say that mean thing."

1627
01:12:18,437 --> 01:12:20,800
"Don't do that violent thing," et cetera.

1628
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,460
Alcohol initially tends
to increase our level

1629
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,800
of overall activity by
reducing inhibition,

1630
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,090
not just in that forebrain
circuit, but in other circuits.

1631
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,240
Tends to make us more active.

1632
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,110
We tend to talk more
than we normally would,

1633
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,690
move more than we normally would,

1634
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:39,620
but very shortly thereafter
starts acting as a sedative

1635
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,433
by way of reducing
activity in the forebrain,

1636
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,020
releasing some of the
deeper brain circuits

1637
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,580
that are involved in impulsivity,

1638
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:51,170
but also causing a
somewhat sedative effect.

1639
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:54,120
And then of course, as alcohol
levels increase even further,

1640
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,053
people eventually will pass
out, blackout, et cetera.

1641
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,960
So what we've got with
alcohol and caffeine

1642
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,970
is we've got two opposite
ends of the spectrum,

1643
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:04,810
caffeine increasing arousal and readiness,

1644
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:08,552
and the tendency for impulsivity
and alcohol also increasing

1645
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:12,423
impulsivity, but through
a different mechanism.

1646
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,100
A really interesting study,
and I should just mention

1647
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,447
that the title of the study is,

1648
01:13:18,447 --> 01:13:20,930
"Caffeinated and
non-caffeinated alcohol use

1649
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,840
and indirect aggression at the
impact of self-regulation."

1650
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,990
So the title is almost self-explanatory.

1651
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:28,130
This was a paper published
in the Journal of Addictive

1652
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:33,130
Behavior in 2016, examining
how ingestion of alcohol

1653
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,440
that's either caffeinated
or non-decaffeinated

1654
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:40,910
alcohol drinks impacted what
they call indirect aggression.

1655
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,800
And just to remind you what
indirect aggression is,

1656
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,860
these are not physical acts of aggression.

1657
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,510
These are verbal acts of aggression,

1658
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:49,920
so embarrassing others or otherwise,

1659
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,960
somehow trying to reduce
the wellbeing of others

1660
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,100
by saying certain things
in particular in groups,

1661
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,730
this study examined
both males and females.

1662
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:02,210
This was done on by way
of a college campus study,

1663
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,770
subjects were 18 to 47 years old.

1664
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,360
I guess there's some older
students on that campus,

1665
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,040
or maybe they use some
non-students, but you know,

1666
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,430
these days you've also got some students

1667
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,030
that are in their thirties and forties.

1668
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:15,240
So they have a fairly broad
swath of subjects included,

1669
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,540
fairly broad racial
background as well, included,

1670
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,070
not at equal numbers, but
at least they included

1671
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,590
a pretty broad spectrum of people

1672
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:23,770
with different backgrounds.

1673
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:27,210
They looked in particular
people that ingested

1674
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,900
non-caffeinated alcohol
drinks at a frequency

1675
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,000
of 9.18 drinks per week, okay.

1676
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,170
Again, there's a college campus,
not that I encourage that.

1677
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,400
I'm one of these people that I don't,

1678
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,200
I've never really liked drugs or alcohol

1679
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,880
and sort fortunate in that
way I can drink or not drink

1680
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,740
and tend to not drink.

1681
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,630
But so to me, 9.18, drinks
per week sounds like a lot,

1682
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:50,380
but I know for some people
that might actually be typical.

1683
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:53,330
And then others who are drinking at least

1684
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:56,850
one caffeinated alcoholic
beverage per week.

1685
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:59,530
And those individuals end as high,

1686
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:04,430
I should say as 7.87 caffeinated
alcohol beverages per week.

1687
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,850
So this would be energy drinks combined,

1688
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,170
typically with hard alcohol,

1689
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,870
that's fairly commonly
available in bars and so forth.

1690
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:14,480
And some individuals
drank as much as goodness,

1691
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,720
20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total,

1692
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,680
some that were caffeinated,
some that were not caffeinated.

1693
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,530
The basic outcome of this study was that

1694
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:26,780
the more alcohol someone
tended to consume,

1695
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,580
the more likely it was
that they would engage

1696
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:31,870
in these indirect
aggressive type behaviors.

1697
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:34,560
And in terms of the caffeinated
alcoholic beverages,

1698
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,190
there, the effect was
especially interesting.

1699
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:37,940
Here I'm just going to
paraphrase or I'll actually

1700
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:42,090
read from the study, quote,
"With regard to caffeinated

1701
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:44,330
alcoholic beverage use,
our findings indicated

1702
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,950
that heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use

1703
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,470
was associated positively
with indirect aggression,

1704
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,920
even after considering
one's typical alcohol use

1705
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,930
and dispositional aggression."

1706
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:56,814
What this means is that
even though alcohol

1707
01:15:56,814 --> 01:15:59,500
can bias certain individuals
to be more aggressive,

1708
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,430
and even though certain
individuals already have

1709
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,800
a disposition toward
being more aggressive,

1710
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,229
there was an effect that was independent,

1711
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:10,818
meaning above and beyond both
alcohol and a predisposition,

1712
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:13,520
meaning if someone was consuming

1713
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,840
caffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had

1714
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,585
a particularly high likelihood of engaging

1715
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:21,410
in indirect aggressive behavior.

1716
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,900
Now this makes perfect
sense in light of the model

1717
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:27,380
they propose, which is
this self-regulation model,

1718
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:29,620
that basically self-regulation
involves several things.

1719
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,100
It involves engaging in certain behaviors

1720
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,440
and suppressing other behaviors.

1721
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,420
So as described before,
because alcohol tends to have

1722
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:41,710
a sedative suppressive
effect on the autonomic

1723
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:45,380
nervous system, at least
after the initial period,

1724
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,910
it's going to tend to
reduce the likelihood

1725
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:50,570
that people will engage
in any type of behavior.

1726
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:53,110
Whereas caffeine will
increase autonomic arousal

1727
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:55,620
and increase the likelihood
that someone will engage

1728
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,960
in a particular type of behavior,
aggressive or otherwise.

1729
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,240
So the combination of caffeine
and alcohol is really acting

1730
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,010
as a two prong system
to bias people towards

1731
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:07,860
more impulsivity that
is less self-regulation.

1732
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,990
So it's really yanking
your volitional control,

1733
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:14,330
your ability to engage in
prefrontal top down inhibition

1734
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,960
over your hypothalamus from two distinct

1735
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,060
and specific circuits.

1736
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,720
By now, you should be
getting the impression

1737
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,330
that self-regulation is a key feature

1738
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:25,460
of whether or not
somebody, maybe even you,

1739
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,310
is going to engage in aggressive speech

1740
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,570
or aggressive behavior.

1741
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:30,610
And we've talked about a number
of tools that one can use

1742
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:34,360
to reduce the probability
that that will happen.

1743
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,390
I suppose, if the
context were appropriate,

1744
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:39,410
you could even take those
tool recommendations

1745
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,950
and just invert them and
increase the likelihood

1746
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,500
that aggressiveness would happen.

1747
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,000
But regardless, self-regulation is key.

1748
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,820
And in light of that, I want
to share with you a study

1749
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:54,820
that's focused on kids, but
that has important ramifications

1750
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:56,426
for adults as well.

1751
01:17:56,426 --> 01:18:01,160
As you probably are already
aware there are many kids

1752
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,630
out there that suffer from so-called

1753
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,640
attention deficit
hyperactivity, disorder, ADHD.

1754
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,390
There are also many adults we are finding

1755
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:09,200
that are suffering from ADHD.

1756
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,900
And there's also an epidemic
I would say of people

1757
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,560
that are concerned about
whether or not they have ADHD.

1758
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,880
Now whether or not they have true,

1759
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,550
clinical ADHD or not, is not clear.

1760
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:22,870
We did an episode all about
ADHD and tools for ADHD.

1761
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,307
I would encourage you to
check out that episode

1762
01:18:24,307 --> 01:18:26,840
and some of the diagnostic criteria.

1763
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,709
If you have the opportunity you
can find at hubermanlab.com,

1764
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:34,420
as this study I'm about to
share with you aptly points out,

1765
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:37,010
there is no objective
diagnostic marker of ADHD.

1766
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:40,620
There's no biomarker or blood
draw or blood test for ADHD,

1767
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:44,910
whether or not one has ADHD
depends on their performance

1768
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:46,930
on a number of different cognitive tests

1769
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,660
and behavioral tests and self report.

1770
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,310
In any event, the study
I'm about to share with you

1771
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,560
explored how a particular
pattern of supplementation

1772
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:00,280
in kids with ADHD was able
to reduce aggressive episodes

1773
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,490
and impulsivity and
increased self-regulation.

1774
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:05,077
And the title of the study is,

1775
01:19:05,077 --> 01:19:07,470
"Efficacy of carnitine in
the treatment of children

1776
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:10,150
with attention deficit,
hyperactivity disorder."

1777
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,050
Even though they put
carnitine in the title,

1778
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:14,420
that what they focused
on was whether or not

1779
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,130
acetyl-L-carnitine
supplementation could somehow

1780
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:21,300
adjust the behavioral tendency
of these kids with ADHD

1781
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:24,420
and to make a long story
short, indeed it did.

1782
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,120
There was a very significant
effect of acetyl L-carnitine

1783
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,009
supplementation on improving
some of the symptomology,

1784
01:19:30,009 --> 01:19:33,268
excuse me, of ADHD.

1785
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,050
A few details about this study

1786
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,700
that might be relevant to you.

1787
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,140
This was a randomized double
blind placebo controlled double

1788
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:42,660
crossover study, this was
done as an outpatient study.

1789
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,240
So the kids weren't in a hospital,

1790
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,560
they were living out in the world.

1791
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,370
This again was done on younger kids.

1792
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,810
So this was six to six to 13 year old kids

1793
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,176
that were diagnosed with ADHD.

1794
01:19:53,176 --> 01:19:58,176
They received either acetyl
L-carnitine or placebo,

1795
01:19:58,476 --> 01:20:02,700
and they did all the good practice stuff

1796
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,320
that good researchers do of making sure

1797
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,760
that the placebo and
the acetyl L-carnitine

1798
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,880
had similar look and taste.

1799
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,880
It was consumed twice daily after meals.

1800
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,440
I should just mentioned
that acetyl L-carnitine

1801
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,120
typically is taken in
capsule form or occasionally

1802
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:17,970
an injectable form.

1803
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,720
Here, they they were
using this as a drink,

1804
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,500
which essentially the
same as capsule form,

1805
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,970
but the powders just
going directly into liquid

1806
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,960
and the carnitine dosage was
100 milligrams per kilogram.

1807
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,780
So they're doing this
according to the body weight

1808
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:34,330
of these kids with a maximum
dosage of four grams per day,

1809
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,280
the quantity of the
medication was supplied here.

1810
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,410
I'm reading for a period of
eight weeks and every eight

1811
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:40,300
weeks a new quantity of
medication was supplied.

1812
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,414
So basically this is a
fairly long term study,

1813
01:20:43,414 --> 01:20:48,270
exploring behavioral outcomes
and psychological outcomes

1814
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:50,760
in week eight, 16 and 24.

1815
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,020
They also looked at blood
things that you could only get

1816
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,221
through a blood draw, so things
like hemoglobin, hematocrit,

1817
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:57,527
red blood cell count, white
blood cell count, et cetera,

1818
01:20:57,527 --> 01:21:00,770
they, these are kids and
even if it were adults,

1819
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:02,630
they were quite appropriately examining

1820
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,030
a lot of the physiological measures

1821
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:07,660
that one would want to
carry out to make sure,

1822
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:10,870
first of all, that blood levels
of carnitine are increasing.

1823
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,840
And indeed they confirmed
that, but also that

1824
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,260
no negative effects are
showing up in the physiology

1825
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,940
as well as the psychology of these kids.

1826
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,040
So, first I'll just tell you
the basic outcome of the study,

1827
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,707
which was, here I'm paraphrasing,

1828
01:21:21,707 --> 01:21:23,350
"Here, given twice
daily, carnitine appeared

1829
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:24,720
to be effective and well tolerated

1830
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,927
treatment for a group
of children with ADHD."

1831
01:21:26,927 --> 01:21:29,500
"They showed significant,
the abnormal behavior

1832
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,730
compared to these other boys."

1833
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:35,130
And now I'm moving to
the table of results.

1834
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,700
They showed significant reductions

1835
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,010
in their so-called "Total Problem Score."

1836
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:41,150
The total problem score is
a well-established measure

1837
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:44,777
of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.

1838
01:21:44,777 --> 01:21:47,330
And I should say adults with ADHD,

1839
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:51,260
has to do with challenges
in social and learning

1840
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,120
environments and how well or poorly

1841
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,100
an individual tends to perform.

1842
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,570
Reductions in intentional
problems, overall reductions

1843
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:00,380
in delinquency, and most important

1844
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,970
for sake of today's discussion,

1845
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:04,730
significant reductions
in aggressive behavior.

1846
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:06,764
Now what's especially nice
about this study, I think,

1847
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:09,011
is that even though it's
a relatively small number

1848
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:12,703
of subjects and certainly
needs to be repeated

1849
01:22:12,703 --> 01:22:16,070
in other studies and other laboratories,

1850
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:21,070
that they were able to confirm
the shifts in L-carnitine

1851
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,440
within the bloodstream of these kids,

1852
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,800
that is they were able to
correlate the physiology

1853
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,390
with the psychological
changes, in studies like this.

1854
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:31,870
And frankly in all studies
of human pharmacology,

1855
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,740
you have to worry about
effects that show up,

1856
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,600
not just because of placebo effects,

1857
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,660
but because of so-called
off target effects

1858
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:40,894
or related things, totally
independent of the drug

1859
01:22:40,894 --> 01:22:42,760
or the particular
supplement that you happen

1860
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,870
to be looking at,

1861
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:46,510
to put in the words of
a great neuroscientist.

1862
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,720
Unfortunately, he passed
away some years ago,

1863
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,140
but he was a member of
the national academy,

1864
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:54,140
extremely accomplished
neuroscientist once turned to me

1865
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:57,220
and said, "Never forget
a drug is a substance

1866
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,860
that when injected into
an animal or a human being

1867
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,840
creates a paper," meaning you
can see effects of pretty much

1868
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:09,350
any drug or any supplement
in most all conditions.

1869
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:12,130
However, it is in cases
such as this study,

1870
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:16,900
where you can quite convincingly
see that the particular

1871
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,540
feature of physiology that
you expected to change,

1872
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,220
actually changed.

1873
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:23,460
And you see a psychological outcome

1874
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:27,550
that you can gain much greater
confidence that the changes

1875
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,150
in delinquency, in this
case reduced delinquency,

1876
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:33,200
improved attention, reduced
aggressiveness and so forth

1877
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,690
was at least somehow related to the shift

1878
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:40,010
in blood physiology and
levels of L-carnitine

1879
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,680
or acetyl L-carnitine and
carnitine in the bloodstream

1880
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,930
of these children, as
opposed to something else

1881
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:48,480
like L-carnitine going and
affecting some downstream target

1882
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,610
that you have no knowledge of.

1883
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:52,090
Now, of course that's
still entirely possible,

1884
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,740
but I think studies such as
these increase our confidence

1885
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,870
that things like L-carnitine can be used

1886
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:01,240
perhaps in concert with things
like omega 3 supplementation,

1887
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,490
diets that are biased towards
increasing more tryptophan

1888
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:06,910
and therefore more serotonin,

1889
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,750
obviously avoiding things like alcohol

1890
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:11,010
and as it appears from the
study I just described,

1891
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:14,920
reducing one's intake or not consuming

1892
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,407
any caffeinated alcoholic
beverages seems like

1893
01:24:17,407 --> 01:24:18,410
it would be a good idea if your goal is

1894
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:21,176
to reduce aggressiveness, to
think about the hormone context

1895
01:24:21,176 --> 01:24:25,510
and whether or not you tend
to have higher testosterone,

1896
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,880
an estrogen or lower
testosterone, an estrogen,

1897
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,390
maybe even think about
the work environment,

1898
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:31,640
whether or not you are
existing in a particularly

1899
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,190
competitive work environment
and even day life,

1900
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:36,610
time of year and whether or not

1901
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,240
you're getting sufficient
sunlight, whether or not

1902
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,710
you're avoiding light in
the evening and so on.

1903
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:42,960
So studies such as this I think are useful

1904
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,910
because they point to the fact
that very seldom, if ever,

1905
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:51,360
will there be one supplement
or one nutritional change

1906
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,770
or even one behavioral change,

1907
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,777
that's going to completely
shift in individual

1908
01:24:54,777 --> 01:24:57,290
from being aggressive and impulsive,

1909
01:24:57,290 --> 01:25:01,700
but rather that by combining
different behavioral regimens,

1910
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,350
by paying attention to
things like time of year

1911
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,420
and work conditions and school conditions

1912
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,630
and overall levels of
stress and likely therefore

1913
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:11,094
levels of cortisol, et cetera,

1914
01:25:11,094 --> 01:25:14,980
that you can use behaviors,
diet, and supplementation

1915
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:19,090
as a way to shift that overall
internal milieu from one

1916
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:22,080
of providing a lot of
internal hydraulic pressure

1917
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,140
as it's been called throughout the episode

1918
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,320
toward aggressive impulsivity and relax

1919
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,440
some of that hydraulic pressure

1920
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,840
and reduce aggressive tendencies.

1921
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,520
So once again, and frankly, as always,

1922
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,360
we've done a deep dive
into the neurobiology

1923
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,580
and the psychology of what I believe to be

1924
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:43,330
an important feature of our
lives, in this case aggression.

1925
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:46,300
I want to point out that in a episode

1926
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,441
in the not too distant future,
I'm going to be hosting

1927
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:52,340
Dr. Professor David Anderson
from Caltech University,

1928
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:57,010
who is the world expert on the
neurobiology of aggression.

1929
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:59,240
In fact, he is the senior
author on many of the studies

1930
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,320
related to the ventromedial hypothalamus

1931
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,920
that I discussed today.

1932
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,920
Our discussion will touch
on aggression, of course.

1933
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,520
So hearing today's episode will help you

1934
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,720
digest that information, but
we are also going to talk

1935
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,370
about other emotional states.

1936
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,280
He is an expert, not just in aggression,

1937
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:18,000
but in motivated states related
to sex and mating behavior,

1938
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,840
social relationships of all
kinds and how those relate,

1939
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,500
not just to biology and psychology,

1940
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,910
but also certain forms of pathology,

1941
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:28,110
things like PTSD and the
relationship for instance,

1942
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:31,155
between anger, fear,
anxiety, and depression,

1943
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:34,570
and many other important
topics that I know many of you,

1944
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:36,400
if not all of you will be interested in.

1945
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,660
In the meantime, I want to point you

1946
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:42,327
to his recently released
and wonderful book entitled,

1947
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:45,070
"The Nature of the Beast,
How Emotions Guide Us."

1948
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:48,780
And again, the author is
David Anderson from Caltech.

1949
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,460
This is a wonderful book.

1950
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,518
It serves as a tremendous introduction

1951
01:26:53,518 --> 01:26:56,410
to the history of the
study of these areas,

1952
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,940
the current science and
discoveries being made

1953
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,390
in these areas, all made
accessible to the scientist

1954
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,650
and non-scientist alike.

1955
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:07,550
It's a very engaging read and so much so

1956
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:10,090
that even though he was
gracious in sending me a copy,

1957
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,720
I also purchased myself a
copy to give to somebody

1958
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,690
who is a therapist, and
I've purchased another copy

1959
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,990
to give to a high school kid that I mentor

1960
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,000
because he's very interested

1961
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,450
in the neuroscience of emotions.

1962
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,736
And I think we are all
interested in emotions,

1963
01:27:22,736 --> 01:27:25,810
not just fear and some
of these negative states,

1964
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:28,010
not just aggression, but
also the positive emotions

1965
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:28,843
of our lives.

1966
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:31,840
And so, "The Nature of the
Beast, How Emotions Guide Us,"

1967
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,200
by David Anderson is a wonderful read.

1968
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,150
I can't recommend it highly enough.

1969
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,560

1988
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:23,030
During today's episode and
on many previous episodes

1989
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,280
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1990
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,910
we discussed supplements.

1991
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,270
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

1992
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,690
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,

1993
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:33,150
for things like improving
the transition time

1994
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:35,200
and the quality of your sleep

1995
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,440
and improving alertness and focus.

1996
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,570
And so on.

1997
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:40,670
Anytime you're considering
taking supplements,

1998
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:42,120
there are several key considerations.

1999
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,640
First of all, those supplements should be

2000
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,280
of the very highest quality.

2001
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,870
And you want to make sure that
what's listed on the bottle

2002
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,130
is actually what's in the bottle,

2003
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,210
which is a problem for any
supplement companies out there.

2004
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:54,670
The Huberman Lab Podcast
is pleased to announce

2005
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,750
that we are now partnered
with Momentous supplements

2006
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,920
because we believe
Momentous supplements to be

2007
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,420
of the very highest quality
of any supplements out there.

2008
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,002
And we've been working
very closely with them

2009
01:29:05,002 --> 01:29:07,650
in order to direct them,
to create supplements

2010
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,604
that are individual ingredient supplements

2011
01:29:09,604 --> 01:29:12,210
of the particular quality and sources

2012
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,360
that we would like to see,

2013
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,780
and that relate to the
science and studies covered

2014
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,330
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2015
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,020
If you'd like to see some
of those supplements,

2016
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,590
you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,

2017
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,980
and there you'll see
some of the supplements

2018
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,870
that we've talked about
on this podcast before

2019
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:30,470
such as magnesium threonate
for augmenting sleep,

2020
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,680
things like L-tyrosine
for augmenting dopamine

2021
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,300
and things like L-carnitine,
which we've discussed

2022
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,501
on today's podcast.

2023
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:39,230
Right now, the list of
supplements and the products

2024
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,210
that are there is only partial to what

2025
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,610
will soon be included in the future.

2026
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:45,140
So that's an ever expanding
catalog of, again,

2027
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:47,110
what we believe to be
the very highest quality

2028
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:48,660
supplements available to you.

2029
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,030
For those of you that are
interested in behavioral,

2030
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:55,070
nutritional and supplementation
based tools for neuroscience

2031
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:57,790
and other aspects of
your biology, the impact,

2032
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:00,110
your health and performance,
we have a newsletter.

2033
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:02,220
It is a zero cost newsletter.

2034
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,930
It's called "The Neural
Network Newsletter."

2035
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:07,380
You can go to hubermanlab.com
and there in the menu,

2036

on Twitter an Instagram,

2044
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:26,805
we are Huberman Lab on
both Instagram and Twitter.

2045
01:30:26,805 --> 01:30:28,363
And at both places,

2046
01:30:28,363 --> 01:30:30,790
I describe science and
science based tools,

2047
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:32,470
