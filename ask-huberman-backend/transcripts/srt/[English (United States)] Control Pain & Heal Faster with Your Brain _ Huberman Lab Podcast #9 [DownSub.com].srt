00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,880
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,670
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,983
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm Andrew Huberman

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,710
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,840
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,670
This podcast is separate from my teaching

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,500
and research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,660
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,820
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,980
about science and science-related tools

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,400
to the general public.

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,760
In keeping with that theme,

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,650
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,027
Our first sponsor is ExpressVPN.

16
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:36,640
ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,410
that keeps your data
secure by routing your data

18
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,120
and online activities
through their servers

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,390
and keeping your data safe and secure

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,740
but also not selling your
data to third parties.

21
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,040
I started using ExpressVPN

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,610
because unfortunately I had
my bank accounts hacked.

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,920
I was traveling a lot

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,870
and I typically go on hotel or airline

25
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,550
or other public Wi-Fi from time to time

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,709
and I don't know how it happened,

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,127
but somehow my information got out there,

28
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:09,520
and as I learned more from my friends

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,810
and people that work
in the tech community,

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,660
it turns out that many
networks are not secure,

31
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,320
so with ExpressVPN,

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,550
it keeps all your information secure.

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,140
It keeps information about
your passwords secure.

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,660
It keeps information about

35
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,300
the websites that you visit secure,

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,760
and as I mentioned earlier,

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,370
they never give away or sell your data.

38
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,730
The nice thing is you can use ExpressVPN,

39
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,030
it runs in the background

40
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,100
and you don't even really
realize that it's on.

41
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,800
It works on your phone,
it works on your laptop,

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,770
it even works on your smart TV.

43
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,690
If you'd like to try ExpressVPN,

44
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,700
you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman

45
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,900
to get three months free
on their one-year program.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,150
I love ExpressVPN.

47
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,370
I use it even when I'm at home,

48
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,410
and so if you want to try it,

49
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,910
you can go to expressvpn.com/huberman

50
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,760
and you'll get three months
free on their one-year program.

51
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,090
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

52
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,410
Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink.

53
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,330
I started taking Athletic Greens in 2012

54
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,380
because I wanted to cover my
vitamin and mineral bases.

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,970
I didn't know which things to take.

56
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,200
I found it really dizzying to know

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,350
which vitamins and minerals to purchase

58
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,390
and Athletic Greens allowed
me to get all the things

59
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,720
I needed to cover my bases in
one easy to consume formula

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,500
that also happens to taste really good.

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,790
I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice.

62
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,330
The probiotics in Athletic Greens

63
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,610
are also really important to me

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,370
because now there's an
abundance of data showing

65
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,810
that the gut microbiome, which
is supported by probiotics,

66
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,660
is important for gut-brain axis, mood,

67
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,040
metabolic function, hormone function,

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
just a huge number of biological functions

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,910
and health parameters.

70
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,430
If you want to try Athletic Greens,

71
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,880
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

72
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,713
and if you do that,

73
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:57,210
they'll give you a year's
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

74
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,720
Vitamin D3 also has lot of support

75
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,990
from the scientific literature

76
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,560
showing that it's important
for immune function,

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,440
so if you go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,680
you'll get Athletic Greens

79
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,060
plus the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2

80
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,230
and they'll give you
five free travel packets.

81
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,070
Mixing up powders is a
little bit messy sometimes

82
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,570
when you're on the road,
if you're in the car,

83
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,400
you're on the plane or you're on the move.

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
These travel packets make
everything really clean

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,430
and really easy.

86
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,510
Once again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman

87
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,450
for Athletic Greens, the
five free travel packets,

88
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,260
and the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.

89
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,810
Many of you have graciously asked

90
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,920
how you can help support
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,770
There are several ways
that you can do that.

92
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,860
One is to check out our sponsors,

93
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,320
the other is we've set
up a Patreon account.

94
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,680
You can go to patreon.com/andrewhuberman

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,770
and that allows you to
donate to the podcast

96
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,200
at a variety of different levels.

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,033
In addition,

98
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,120
if you could subscribe to
the podcast on YouTube,

99
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,953
that's terrific.

100
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:59,180
If you haven't done that
already, please do so,

101
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,460
and please leave a comment.

102
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,910
If you want to make suggestions
about future episodes,

103
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,420
please also put that
in the comment section.

104
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,810
If you subscribe on Apple or
Spotify or both, that helps us,

105
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,220
and as well, Apple gives
you the opportunity

106
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,500
to leave a review and
give us a five star rating

107
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,079
if you feel we deserve a five star rating,

108
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,049
and of course,

109
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,370
please recommend the
podcast to your friends,

110
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,670
to your family members,

111
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,770
anyone that you think would
benefit from the information.

112
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,070
Really, the answer to your question of

113
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,860
how you can support the podcast is

114
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,230
you don't have to buy products,

115
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,910
although checking out
the sponsors does help.

116
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,200
You don't have to donate to Patreon.

117
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,480
We, of course, can't
require you to subscribe

118
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,690
and fill out reviews
and things of that sort,

119
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,790
but we like to think that by providing

120
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,570
a number of different ways
to support the podcast,

121
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,840
some of which are zero cost,

122
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,650
some of which, if you like,

123
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,710
gives you the opportunity
to contribute financially,

124
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,490
that's terrific as well.

125
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,323
Thank you so much.

126
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:55,590
We really appreciate your interest

127
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,780
in helping us keep this coming your way.

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,613
Thank you.

129
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:02,540
Let's continue our discussion
about neuroplasticity.

130
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,440
This incredible feature
of our nervous system

131
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,680
that allows it to change itself
in response to experience,

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,830
and even in ways that we consciously

133
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,190
and deliberately decide to change it.

134
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,700
That's an incredible feature.

135
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,750
No other organ in our
body has that capability.

136
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,840
Our nervous system,

137
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,750
which governs everything about who we are,

138
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,460
how we feel and what we do,

139
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,430
does have that capability.

140
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,070
The issue is most people don't know

141
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,440
how to access neuroplasticity.

142
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,780
Children readily access neuroplasticity

143
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,000
and they don't even realize
that they're doing it.

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,120
Adults want neuroplasticity

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,080
and so that's what this entire month

146
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,250
of the Huberman Lab
Podcast has been about.

147
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,260
We've explored neuroplasticity

148
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,970
from a variety of different perspectives.

149
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,960
We talked about
representational plasticity.

150
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,670
We talked about the importance
of focus and reward.

151
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,020
We talked about this amazing
and somewhat surprising aspect

152
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,650
of the vestibular system,

153
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,420
how altering our relationship to gravity,

154
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,240
and in addition to that,

155
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,140
making errors as we try and learn,

156
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,340
can open up windows to plasticity,

157
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,640
but we have not really
talked so much about

158
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,530
directing the plasticity
toward particular outcomes,

159
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,530
and thus far,

160
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,710
we really haven't talked yet

161
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,050
about how to undo things
that we don't want.

162
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,550
I've talked about learning and I say

163
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,800
learn a language, learn free throws,

164
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,350
learn a particular motor skill, et cetera,

165
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,280
but what about what we
would call unlearning

166
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,270
or about removing some aspect

167
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,070
of our experience that we don't want?

168
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,110
And so today,

169
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,630
we are going to explore that
aspect of neuroplasticity

170
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,540
and we are going to do that in the context

171
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,000
of a very important and
somewhat sensitive topic

172
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
which is pain regeneration,

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,700
and in some cases, injury
to the nervous system.

174
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,800
For those of you that are fortunate enough

175
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,350
to not have or had a concussion

176
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,960
or not have or know someone

177
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,780
who is experiencing chronic or acute pain,

178
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,390
I encourage you to stay in here with us

179
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,780
because a lot of the information
that we are going to cover

180
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,780
has direct relevance to
neuroplasticity for other purposes.

181
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,170
We, as always here on this podcast,

182
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,970
are going to discuss some of the science,

183
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,640
we get into mechanism,

184
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,760
but we also really get at principles.

185
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,540
Principles are far more
important than any one experiment

186
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,140
or one description of mechanism

187
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,220
and certainly far more
important than any one protocol

188
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,670
because principles allow you

189
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,460
to think about your nervous system

190
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,070
and work with it in ways
that best serve you.

191
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,163
They are very flexible
batches of information.

192
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,250
We are going to talk about the
principles of neuroplasticity

193
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,000
for removing pain and
wound healing and injury.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,410
We're going to talk about
acupuncture, of all things.

195
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,700
We are going to talk about
modern medicine's attempt

196
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,880
to try and restore youth to the aging

197
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,470
or injured or demented brain,

198
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,990
and we are going to
definitely talk about tools.

199
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,000
Got a lot of tools.

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,330
I consulted a number of
fantastic colleagues at Stanford,

201
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,630
at Harvard Medical School,

202
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,410
and in the greater community
of tissue rehabilitation,

203
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,503
injury and pain management in
preparation for this podcast.

204
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,510
I do want to be very
clear and just remind you

205
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,310
that I'm not a medical doctor.

206
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm a professor, so I
don't prescribe anything.

207
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,010
I profess things.

208
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,020
I have my beliefs,

209
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,540
but the podcast is for
information purposes.

210
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,620
I do hope that the tools that we discuss

211
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,890
will be of benefit to you, but as always,

212
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,659
you should talk to your
doctor or healthcare provider

213
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,039
about any tools that you plan to add

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,689
or are looking to explore,

215
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,320
as well as anything that
you might look to remove

216
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
from your daily protocols.

217
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,880
In other words, don't change anything

218
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,970
without consulting an expert first.

219
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,220
You are responsible for
your health, not me,

220
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,510
and I say this not just to protect me

221
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,110
but also to protect you.

222
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,480
Please keep that in
mind as we move forward

223
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,740
and I'm very excited to share
with you this information

224
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,130
because I do feel that it
can be of great benefit

225
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,810
to a number of people.

226
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,900
Let's start our discussion
about pain and sensation

227
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,490
and regeneration and wound
healing with a discussion about

228
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,910
a very important system
in the nervous system,

229
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,330
which is the somatosensory system.

230
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,890
The somatosensory system
is, as the name implies,

231
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,140
involved in understanding touch,

232
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,660
physical feeling on our body,

233
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,450
and the simplest way to think
about the somatosensory system

234
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,990
is that we have little sensors

235
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,240
and those sensors come in the
form of neurons, nerve cells,

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,700
that reside in our skin

237
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,730
and in the deeper layers below the skin,

238
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,920
and indeed, we do.

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,390
We have some that correspond to,

240
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,000
and we should say respond
to, mechanical touch,

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,750
so pressure on the top
of my hand or a pinpoint,

242
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,020
or other sensors, for instance,
respond to heat, to cold.

243
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,920
Some respond to vibration.

244
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,640
We have a huge number of
different receptors in our skin

245
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,250
and they take that information

246
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,460
and send it down these
wires that we call axons

247
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,010
in the form of electrical
signals to our spinal cord

248
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,450
and then up to the brain,

249
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,940
and within the spinal cord and brain,

250
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,810
we have centers that
interpret that information,

251
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,970
that actually make sense of
those electrical signals,

252
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,830
and this is amazing because
none of those sensors

253
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,130
has a different unique form
of information that it uses.

254
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,010
It just sends electrical
potentials into the nervous system.

255
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,370
The nervous system,

256
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,370
you somehow decode what a
given stimulus on your skin is.

257
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,270
Maybe it's the wind blowing gently

258
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,140
and deflecting some of
the hairs on your arm

259
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,540
or maybe it's a sharp
pinprick or a hot stove

260
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,170
or the warmth of a glowing fire.

261
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,490
That all arrives in your nervous system

262
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,730
in the form of these electrical things

263
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,860
we call action potentials,
which is just amazing,

264
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,510
and then the brain computes
them and make sense of them.

265
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,750
We have peripheral sensors

266
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,910
and we've got stations up in our brain

267
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,130
and within our spinal cord

268
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,100
that make sense of all
the stuff coming in.

269
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,010
Pain and the sensation of
pain is, believe it or not,

270
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,010
a controversial word in
the neuroscience field.

271
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,110
People prefer to use the word nociception.

272
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin

273
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,660
that detect particular types of stimuli.

274
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,610
It actually comes from
the Latin word nocere

275
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,940
which means to harm,

276
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,490
and why would neuroscientists
not want to talk about pain?

277
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,270
Well, it's very subjective.

278
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,820
It has a mental component
and a physical component.

279
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,920
We cannot say that pain
is simply an attempt

280
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,690
to avoid physical harm to the body,

281
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,140
and here's why.

282
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,630
They actually can be
dissociated from one another.

283
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,510
A good example would be if, God forbid,

284
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,963
you were exposed to high
levels of radiation,

285
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,480
such as working with some sort of material

286
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,830
that was radioactive

287
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,080
or you were near a
former radioactive plant

288
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,870
or some some radiation,

289
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,620
excessive X-rays, et cetera,

290
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,020
you wouldn't feel any
pain during the X-rays.

291
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,853
In fact, you don't.

292
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,950
If you've ever had X-rays, as I have,

293
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,410
you don't feel anything.

294
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,940
They put you under that lead blanket,

295
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,810
they run behind a wall
and then they, in my case,

296
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,300
then they take these
pictures of your teeth

297
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,517
and it's really scary because you go,

298
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:23,270
"Something really terrible
must be happening here,"

299
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,070
but you don't feel anything,

300
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,780
but there can be a lot of tissue damage.

301
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,070
There can be mutations
introduced to cells, et cetera.

302
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,903
I've had X-rays,

303
00:12:31,903 --> 00:12:33,250
I'm not saying people
shouldn't have X-rays,

304
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,070
but excessive X-rays
certainly are not good

305
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,560
for human beings,

306
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,480
likewise with excessive
exposure to any radiation.

307
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,750
There can be tissue damage
without the physical perception

308
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,870
or mental perception of pain at all.

309
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,010
As well, there can be the belief of pain

310
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,830
or the feeling of pain without
there being tissue damage,

311
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,500
and there's a famous
case that was published

312
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,580
in the "British Journal of Medicine"

313
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,363
where a construction worker,

314
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,460
I think he fell is how the story went,

315
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,500
and a 14-inch nail

316
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,000
went through his boot
and up through the boot

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,030
and he was in excruciating pain

318
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,010
just beyond anything he'd experienced.

319
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,610
He reported that he couldn't
even move in any dimension,

320
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,530
even a tiny bit, without
feeling excruciating pain.

321
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,580
They brought him into the
clinic, into the hospital,

322
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,280
they were able to cut away the boot

323
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,990
and they realized that the
nail had gone between two toes

324
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,220
and it had actually not
impaled the skin at all.

325
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,360
His visual image of the
nail going through his boot

326
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,320
gave him the feeling,
the legitimate feeling,

327
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,420
that he was experiencing the pain

328
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,770
of a nail going through his foot,

329
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,010
which is incredible

330
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,570
because it speaks to the power of the mind

331
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,480
in this pain scenario

332
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,040
and it also speaks to the
power of the specificity.

333
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,060
It's not like he thought
that his foot was on fire.

334
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,240
He thought, because he saw a
nail going through his foot,

335
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,100
well, it was going through his boot,

336
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,950
but he thought it was
going through his foot,

337
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,800
that it was sharp pain of the sort

338
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,500
that a nail would produce,

339
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,240
and there are thousands

340
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,800
of these kinds of case reports out there.

341
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,270
That is not to say that
all pain that we experience

342
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,770
is in our head,

343
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,470
but it really speaks to
the incredible capacity

344
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,990
that these top-down,

345
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,920
these higher-level
cognitive functions have

346
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,090
in interpreting what we're experiencing

347
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,090
out in the periphery,

348
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,620
even just on the basis of what we see,

349
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,770
and the example of
radiation speaks to the fact

350
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,610
that pain and tissue damage

351
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,513
are dissociable from one another.

352
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,380
Why are we talking about pain

353
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,500
during a month on neuroplasticity?

354
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,280
Well, it turns out that
the pain system offers us

355
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,010
a number of different principles
that we can leverage to,

356
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,080
A, ensure that if we are ever injured,

357
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,690
we are able to understand the difference

358
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,920
between injury and pain
because there is a difference,

359
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,150
that if we're ever in pain,

360
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,370
that we can understand
the difference between

361
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,790
injury and pain,

362
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,950
that we will be able
to interpret our pain,

363
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,930
and during the course of today's podcast,

364
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,910
I'm going to cover protocols
that help eliminate pain

365
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,040
from both ends of the spectrum,

366
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,340
from the periphery, at
the level of the injury,

367
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,890
and through these top-down
mental mechanisms.

368
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,050
A lot of times on this
podcast, in fact mostly,

369
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,500
I tend to center on the physiology,

370
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,190
on the really objective things

371
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,760
that you can describe and talk about,

372
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,740
diaphragmatic movement

373
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,300
or sunlight of a particular
number of photons, et cetera,

374
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,200
but today's a really exciting opportunity

375
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,380
for us to discuss some of
the more subjective things.

376
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,810
Believe it or not, we're
going to talk about love.

377
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,940
A colleague of mine at Stanford,

378
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,113
who runs a major pain clinic,

379
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,860
is working on and has published
quality peer-reviewed data

380
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,410
on the role of love in
modulating the pain response,

381
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,310
only there's a twist to it

382
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,670
and I'm not going to reveal it just yet,

383
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,810
but it turns out that the
specific type of connection

384
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,970
one has to a romantic partner

385
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,670
actually dictates whether
or not their love for them

386
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,480
will alleviate physical pain

387
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,370
and the effects are really robust.

388
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,860
It's an amazing literature,

389
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,240
and so what we're talking about today

390
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,660
is plasticity of perception,

391
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,930
which has direct bearing on emotional pain

392
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,900
and has direct bearing on trauma

393
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,180
and other things that we discussed

394
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,590
in previous episodes a little bit

395
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,850
but that we're going to explore even more

396
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,253
in an entire month about those topics.

397
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,070
Let's get started in thinking
about what happens with pain,

398
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,970
and I will describe some examples

399
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,130
of some kind of extreme cases.

400
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,470
For instance, I will tell you just now

401
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,670
that there is a mutation,

402
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,160
a genetic mutation in a
particular sodium channel.

403
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,410
A sodium channel is one of
these little holes in neurons

404
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,350
that allows them to
fire action potentials.

405
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,730
It's important to the
function of the neuron.

406
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,540
It's also important for the
development of certain neurons,

407
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,330
and there's a particular mutation,

408
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,530
there are kids that are born

409
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,130
without this sodium channel 1.7,

410
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,250
if you want to look it up.

411
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,780
Those kids experience no
pain, no pain whatsoever,

412
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,160
and it is a terrible situation.

413
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,030
They burn themselves.

414
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,550
They tend to rest on their limbs too long.

415
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,609
They don't make the microadjustments.

416
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,929
You might see me swiveling
around in my chair,

417
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,770
moving around a lot.

418
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,700
Those microadjustments are actually

419
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,829
normal, healthy microadjustments

420
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,299
that prevent us from going into pain.

421
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,420
They don't make those adjustments.

422
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,960
They don't get the feedback

423
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,390
that they're in a particular position

424
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,900
and so they never make those adjustments

425
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,970
and their joints get
destroyed, essentially.

426
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,210
They don't tend to live
very long due to accidents.

427
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,890
It's a really terrible and
unfortunate circumstance.

428
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,090
Some people have a mutation
in the same channel

429
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,630
where they make too much of this channel

430
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,760
so they feel too much pain.

431
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,260
In fact, it's reasonable to speculate

432
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,670
that one of the reasons, not all,

433
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,880
but one of the reasons
why people might differ

434
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
in their sensitivity to pain

435
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,590
is by way of genetic variation

436
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,810
in how many of these sorts of
receptors that they express.

437
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,480
People who make too much of this receptor

438
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,250
experience extreme pain
from even subtle stimuli.

439
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,250
The good news is there
are good drug treatments

440
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,780
that can block specifically
this sodium channel 1.7

441
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,860
and so those people get a lot of relief

442
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,030
from taking such drugs.

443
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,780
Pain and how much pain we are sensitive to

444
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,900
or insensitive to probably
has some genetic basis,

445
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,380
and then of course, there
are things that we can do

446
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,980
to make sure that we experience less pain,

447
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,590
although pain has this adaptive role.

448
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,520
Let's talk about some of the features of

449
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,780
how we're built physically
and how that relates to pain

450
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,360
and how we can recover from injury.

451
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,193
First of all,

452
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,140
we have maps of our body
surface in our brain.

453
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,950
It's called a homunculus.

454
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,970
In a rat, believe it or
not, I'm not making this up,

455
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,460
it's called a ratunculus.

456
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,010
In Costello, my dog, who
is snoring behind me,

457
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,633
it's a dogunculus.

458
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,970
I could get into the nomenclature
and why it's called this,

459
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,770
but it's basically a
representation of the body surface.

460
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,890
That representation is scaled

461
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,740
in a way that matches sensitivity,

462
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,740
so the areas of your body
that are most sensitive

463
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,720
have a lot more brain real
estate devoted to them.

464
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,260
Your back is an enormous piece of tissue

465
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,930
compared to your fingertip,

466
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,670
but your back has fewer
receptors devoted to it

467
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,680
and the representation of
your back in your brain

468
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,600
is actually pretty small,

469
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,763
whereas the representation
of your finger is enormous.

470
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:32,840
How big a brain area is
devoted to a given body part

471
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,580
is directly related

472
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,800
to the density of receptors
in that body part,

473
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,160
not the size of the body part,

474
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,700
and that's why if we were
to draw your homunculus

475
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,870
or Costello's dogunculus,

476
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,630
what we would find is that certain areas,

477
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,050
like the lips, like the fingertips,

478
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,370
like the genitalia,

479
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,120
like the eyes and the
area around the face,

480
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,300
would have a huge representation,

481
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,000
whereas the back, the torso,

482
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,610
and areas of the body
that are less sensitive

483
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,040
are going to have smaller representations.

484
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,980
It'd be a very distorted map.

485
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
You can actually know

486
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,550
how sensitive a given body part is

487
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,620
and how much brain area is devoted to it

488
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,740
through what's called
two-point discrimination.

489
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,970
You can do this experiment if you want.

490
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,670
I think I've described
this once or twice before,

491
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,980
but basically if you have someone put,

492
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,610
maybe take two pens

493
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,078
and put them maybe six
inches apart on your back

494
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:26,600
and touch while you're facing away

495
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,870
and they'll ask you how many
points they're touching you

496
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,900
and you say two,

497
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,340
but if they move those closer
together, say three inches,

498
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,730
you're likely to experience
it as one point of contact,

499
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,080
whereas on your finger,

500
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,340
you could play that game all day

501
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,510
and as long as there's a
millimeter or so spacing,

502
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,800
you will know that it's two
points as opposed to one

503
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,220
and that's because there's more pixels,

504
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,600
more density of receptors.

505
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,410
This has direct bearing to pain

506
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,330
because it says that areas of the body

507
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,340
that have denser receptors
are going to be more sensitive

508
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,690
to pain than to others,

509
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,530
and where we have more receptors,

510
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,520
we tend to have more
blood vessels and glia,

511
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,040
which are the support cells,

512
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,400
and other cells that lend
to the inflammation response

513
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,803
and that's really important.

514
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,320
Just as a rule of thumb,

515
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,260
areas of your body that are injured

516
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,870
that are large areas that have
low sensitivity before injury

517
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,180
likely are going to experience less pain

518
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,180
and the literature shows
will heal more slowly

519
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,080
because they don't have
as many cells around

520
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,570
to produce inflammation,

521
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,200
and you might say, "Wait, I
thought inflammation is bad."

522
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,260
Well, one of the things I
really want to get across today

523
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,150
is that inflammation is not bad.

524
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,010
Inflammation out of control is bad,

525
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,910
but inflammation is wonderful.

526
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,720
Inflammation is the tissue repair response

527
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,940
and we are going to talk about
subjective and objective ways

528
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,300
to modulate inflammation
after tissue injury,

529
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,203
even after just exercise
that's been too intense.

530
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,550
You have this map of your body surface.

531
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,060
It's sensitive in different
ways. Now you know why.

532
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,850
You've got your neurobiology
of somatosensation 101

533
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,360
under your belt now.

534
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,470
We didn't cover everything,

535
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,660
but we'll touch on some
of the other details

536
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,110
as we go forward.

537
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,850
I thought it might be a nice
time to just think about

538
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,200
the relationship between the
periphery and the central maps

539
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,260
in a way that many of you have
probably heard about before,

540
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,550
which will frame the
discussion a little bit better,

541
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,850
which is phantom limb pain.

542
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,340
Some of you are probably
familiar with this,

543
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,280
but for people that have an arm or a leg

544
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,120
or a finger or some other
portion of their body amputated,

545
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,440
it's not uncommon for those people

546
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,560
to feel as if they still
have that limb or appendage

547
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,460
or piece of their body intact,

548
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,540
and typically, unfortunately,

549
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,470
the sensation of that limb
is not one of the limb

550
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,410
being nice and relaxed and just there.

551
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,620
The sensation is that the
limb is experiencing pain

552
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,510
or is contorted in the
specific orientation

553
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,680
that it was around the time of the injury.

554
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,530
If someone has a blunt force to the hand

555
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,370
and they end up having
their hand amputated,

556
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,780
typically they will continue to feel pain

557
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,830
in their phantom hand,
which is pretty wild,

558
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,870
and that's because the
representation of that hand

559
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,240
is still intact in the
cortex, in the brain,

560
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,270
and it's trying to balance
its levels of activity.

561
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,240
Normally it's getting what's
called proprioceptive feedback.

562
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,140
Proprioception is just our knowledge

563
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,630
of where our limbs are in space.

564
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,490
It's an extremely important aspect

565
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,680
of our somatosensory system,

566
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,640
and there's no proprioceptive feedback

567
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,650
and so a lot of the
circuits start to ramp up

568
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,940
their levels of activity

569
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,933
and they become very
conscious of the phantom limb.

570
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:43,470
Before my lab was at Stanford,

571
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,670
I was at UC San Diego and one
of my colleagues was a guy,

572
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,580
everyone just calls him by
his last name, Ramachandran,

573
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,910
who is famous for understanding
this phantom limb phenomenon

574
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,270
and developing a very simple

575
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,560
but very powerful solution to it

576
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,980
that speaks to the incredible capacity

577
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,650
of top-down modulation,

578
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,870
and top-down modulation,

579
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,590
the ability to use one's
brain cognition and senses

580
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,010
to control pain in the body,

581
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,560
is something that everyone,

582
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,200
not just people missing
limbs or in chronic pain,

583
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,830
can learn to benefit from
because it is a way to tap into

584
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,140
our ability to use our mind

585
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,330
to control perceptions of
what's happening in our body,

586
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,790
and this is not a mystical statement.

587
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,490
This is not about mind, I
guess, as much as it is brain

588
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,930
to control our perceptions of our body.

589
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,100
What did Ramachandran do?

590
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Ramachandran had people
who were missing a limb

591
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,130
put their intact limb into a box

592
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,570
that had mirrors in it

593
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,470
such that when they looked in the box

594
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,200
and they moved their intact limb,

595
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,170
the opposite limb,

596
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,300
which was a reflection of the intact limb

597
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,000
'cause they're missing the opposite limb,

598
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,970
they would see it as if it was intact,

599
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,060
and as they would move their intact limb,

600
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,540
they would visualize with their eyes

601
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,390
the limb that's in the
place of the absent limb,

602
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,870
so this is all by mirrors,

603
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,520
moving around and they
would feel immediate relief

604
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,080
from the phantom pain,

605
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,100
and he would tell them and
they would direct their hand

606
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,400
toward a orientation that
felt comfortable to them.

607
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,150
Then they would exit the mirror box,

608
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,770
they would take their hand out,

609
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,677
and they would feel as if

610
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:29,610
the hand was now in its
relaxed normal position.

611
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,190
You could get real time, in moments,

612
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,070
remapping of the
representation of the hand.

613
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,180
Now, that's amazing.

614
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,480
This is the kind of thing that all of us

615
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,890
would like to be able
to do if we are in pain.

616
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,810
If you stub your toe,
if you break your ankle,

617
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,660
if you take a hard fall on your bike

618
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,536
or if you're in chronic pain.

619
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:47,920
Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to use

620
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,530
a mind trick,

621
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,140
but it's not a trick because
it's real, visual imagery,

622
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,850
to remap your representation
of your body surface

623
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,260
and where your body is.

624
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,540
That is something that
we could all benefit from

625
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,000
because if you do anything for
long enough, including live,

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,170
you're going to experience
pain of some sort,

627
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,080
and this, again I just want to remind you,

628
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,600
isn't just about physical
injuries and pain,

629
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,160
this has direct relevance
to emotional pain as well,

630
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,243
which, of course, we'll talk about.

631
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,330
The Ramachandran studies
were really profound

632
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,560
because they said a couple things.

633
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,250
One, plasticity can be very fast,

634
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,930
that it can be driven by
the experience of something,

635
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,970
just the visual experience.

636
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,490
He had people do this mirror box thing

637
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,150
but not look into the mirror box

638
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,450
and they didn't get the remapping,

639
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,943
so it required visual imagery coming in.

640
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,150
We also know, for instance,

641
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,713
that in cases like where
people are congenitally deaf,

642
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,050
the cochlear implant,

643
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,230
which is simply a way of
putting, it's not simple,

644
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,270
but it's a way of putting in a device

645
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,350
that replaces the cochlea,

646
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,420
the device that we're
normally born with in the ear

647
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,410
that has these little
what are called hair cells

648
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,320
that deflect according to sound
waves and allow us to hear.

649
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,470
By replacing the normal hearing apparatus

650
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,090
that's deficient in deaf people
with this cochlear implant,

651
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,810
the brain can make sense of
this artificial ear, basically,

652
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,830
it's not the outside ear, not
the pinna, but the inner ear,

653
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,870
and they can start to hear sounds.

654
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,860
Some people really like
the artificial cochlea.

655
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,640
They really benefit from it.

656
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,960
It restores their ability
to hear and they like it.

657
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,990
Other people don't.

658
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,460
Some deaf people would
prefer not to hear anything,

659
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,190
can be very disruptive to them,

660
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,140
and some of that might
have to do with the need

661
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,470
for further better engineering
of these artificial cochleas,

662
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,730
but all this really speaks to the fact

663
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,870
that the brain is an adaptive device.

664
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,190
It will respond to what you give it.

665
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,060
It is not a device that is fixed.

666
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,670
In fact, the essence of the brain,

667
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,970
especially the human brain,

668
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,960
is to take sensory inputs

669
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,040
and to make sense of those,
meaning cognitive sense,

670
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,750
and then to interpret those signals,

671
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,230
and so this may come as
a shock to some of you

672
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,140
and by no means am I
trying to be insensitive,

673
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,040
but pain is a perceptual thing

674
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,960
as much as it's a physical thing.

675
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,920
It's a belief system about

676
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,520
what you're experiencing in your body

677
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,250
and that has important relevance

678
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,130
for healing different types of injury

679
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,660
and the pain associated with that injury.

680
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,300
In people's pursuit for neuroplasticity,

681
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,860
a question that comes
up every once in a while

682
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,247
is people will say,

683
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,840
"If I just brush my teeth
with the opposite hand

684
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,090
for a couple nights in a row,

685
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,180
will I get neuroplasticity?"

686
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,630
And the answer is probably
yes. It's a deliberate action.

687
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,270
You're focusing on it.
There's an end goal.

688
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,810
You're very likely to make errors,

689
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,530
like jamming up into your
lips and gums at first

690
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,363
and then getting better at it,

691
00:28:44,363 --> 00:28:46,240
and as you heard in last episode,

692
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,150
making errors is really important

693
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,770
'cause those errors are the signal

694
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,390
that plasticity needs to happen,

695
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,230
and then when you get the actions correct,

696
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,480
then those correct
actions are programmed in.

697
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,260
I'm not sure that brushing one's teeth

698
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,970
with the opposite hand is the most

699
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,820
effective use of this
incredible thing that we have,

700
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,670
which is plasticity.

701
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,740
It's not going to open up
plasticity for many other things.

702
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,380
If that were really important
to you, for whatever reason,

703
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,930
maybe you have a crowded bathroom

704
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,180
and it's easier to do on one
side or the other, then fine,

705
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,790
but it's kind of hard to
imagine why this would be

706
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,710
a highly adaptive behavior,

707
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,210
unless, of course, you
have an injured limb

708
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,320
or you're missing a limb,

709
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,500
and that gets me to some really exciting

710
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,040
and important studies that were performed

711
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,250
mostly in the '90s as
well as in the 2000s,

712
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,370
and that, for now, there is
really a solid base of data.

713
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,570
There's really a center of mass around

714
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,330
a particular set of experiments

715
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,680
that point to particular protocols

716
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,940
for how to overcome motor injury,

717
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,730
and this may resonate with some of you

718
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,370
who've ever been injured to the point

719
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,840
where you couldn't walk well,

720
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,730
temporarily, I hope, or even longer.

721
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,260
Think about a sprained ankle scenario

722
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,063
or a broken arm scenario.

723
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,970
We're all familiar with
the stories of people

724
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,220
having a cast on and
then getting the cast off

725
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,890
and the particular limb
that wasn't being used

726
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,170
that was casted is much
smaller and atrophied.

727
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,430
Most of that atrophy, you
might be surprised to learn,

728
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,030
is not because the
muscles aren't being used.

729
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,060
It's because the nerves sending
signals to those muscles

730
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,513
are not active and therefore
the muscles aren't contracting.

731
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,880
Work done by a guy named Timothy Schallert

732
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,200
and his graduate students and postdocs,

733
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,020
Theresa Jones and others,

734
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,220
in the '90s and 2000s showed
something really wonderful

735
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,150
that I think we can all benefit from

736
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,460
should we have an injury

737
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,460
and even if we simply want
to balance out imbalances

738
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,930
in our motor activity,

739
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,520
and I think all of us tend to be stronger

740
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,020
on one side or the other side.

741
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,460
Usually a right-handed person

742
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,480
will be stronger in their
left arm, not always,

743
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,720
for compensatory reasons.

744
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,290
Some other time we can
talk about handwriting.

745
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,440
The lefties likely will be
stronger in their right arm,

746
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,890
although it depends on whether or not

747
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,330
people are hook righties,

748
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,280
that's when you hook around
and write from the top,

749
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,570
or hook lefties.

750
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,870
There are all sorts of theories about this

751
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,040
that we can talk about,

752
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,250
right brain, left brain,
math proficiency, et cetera.

753
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,830
In any event,

754
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,460
what Schallert and colleagues showed

755
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,970
was that if we have damage to our brain

756
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,580
in the sensory motor pathways,

757
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,410
any number of different
sensory motor pathways,

758
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:29,010
or we have damage to a limb,

759
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,460
could be a leg, could be
an arm, could be a hand,

760
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,880
there's great benefit
to restricting the use

761
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,880
of the opposite,
better-performing, uninjured limb

762
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,920
or hand or other part of the body.

763
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,470
They had about a dozen papers showing

764
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,450
that if there was damage
centrally in the brain

765
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,150
or there was damage to a limb,

766
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,270
so unilateral damage, as we say, one side,

767
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,270
the thing to do is not to
cast up the damaged side,

768
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,870
although you need to do
that to protect the limb,

769
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,260
of course, from further damage.

770
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,990
If it's a broken arm,
you need to cast the arm

771
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,610
or you need to brace the arm,

772
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,620
but that the key thing
was to restrict movement

773
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,960
of the intact, uninjured, opposite limb,

774
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,980
and when they did that,

775
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,440
it forced some movement
in the injured limb

776
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,400
and remarkably,

777
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,450
through connections from
the two sides of the brain,

778
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,530
through the corpus callosum,

779
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,820
this huge fiber pathway

780
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,750
that links the two sides of the brain,

781
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,380
they saw plasticity on
both sides of the brain.

782
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,500
This makes sense when you hear it.

783
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,660
Let's say I injure my left ankle

784
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,970
and I'm limping along
or I'm using crutches.

785
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,110
You would think, well, the
last thing you want to do

786
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,190
is injure your opposite limb
or not use your opposite limb.

787
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,030
My right ankle is perfectly fine,

788
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,130
but if I lean too hard on my right limb

789
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,677
and I take all the work
out of the left limb,

790
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,460
the left ankle,

791
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,220
that's actually setting up a situation

792
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,270
where there's going to
be runaway asymmetry

793
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,780
in the central pathways

794
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,400
and the nerve-to-muscle
pathways on my left side,

795
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,830
and so what they suggested

796
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,760
and what they showed in
a variety of experiments

797
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,470
was that by encouraging
activity of the injured limb,

798
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,560
provided it could be done without pain,

799
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,870
and importantly,

800
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,180
not just exercising that
limb or part of the body

801
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,103
but restricting the opposite
healthy part of the body,

802
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,150
that the speed of recovery
was significantly faster.

803
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,160
Now, I want to repeat,

804
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,050
you don't want to go
injuring something further.

805
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,180
That's probably the
worst thing you could do,

806
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,300
but in some cases where people
have damage in their brain,

807
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,700
the limbs are perfectly fine,

808
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,920
but the motor signals aren't
getting down to the limbs,

809
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,430
and in that case, the limb is fine,

810
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,650
so you actually are free to use

811
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,430
either limb as much as you
want, and in that case,

812
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,430
you don't want to rely on the
uninjured pathway too much.

813
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,430
In fact, you want to restrict
the uninjured pathway.

814
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,460
I find these studies remarkable

815
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,500
and they've been followed up
on at the molecular level,

816
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,570
at the cellar level many times,

817
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,490
and I think the physiotherapists out there

818
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,937
and the rest of you who are
involved in sports medicine

819
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,456
and some of the physicians will say,

820
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,139
"Well, of course that
makes perfect sense,"

821
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,969
but oftentimes this is not what happens.

822
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,489
Oftentimes what happens
is it's all about resting

823
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,609
and limiting inflammation, et cetera,

824
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,489
of the injured limb

825
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,859
or the limbs corresponding to
the injured part of the brain,

826
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,610
and these experiments and
the collection of them

827
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,380
point to the fact that the balance between

828
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,380
the right and left side of
our body is always dynamic.

829
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,139
It's always being updated at
the level of neural circuitry,

830
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,969
the Ramachandran studies
with the mirror box

831
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:38,999
support that too,

832
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,540
and that even slight imbalances
in the two sides of the body

833
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,040
can get amplified,

834
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,730
and so when you're in a situation
where one side is injured

835
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,280
or the brain is injured
representing one side of the body,

836
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,650
the key thing to do is to really overwork

837
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,610
the side that needs the work

838
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,550
and to restrict the activity of the side

839
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,930
that doesn't need the
work because it's healthy,

840
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,450
and this has great semblance
to ocular dominance plasticity,

841
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,390
which I talked about
a couple episodes ago.

842
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,800
I won't go into it in detail,

843
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,810
but where the Nobel Prize
winning neurobiologists

844
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,280
Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel showed

845
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,470
that if one eye is closed
early in development,

846
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,080
that the representation of
the opposite eye in the brain

847
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,313
is completely overtaken by the intact eye.

848
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,783
This is important.

849
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:27,520
It means that all of our
senses and our movements

850
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,380
are competing for space in our brain

851
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,550
and so the way to think
about the principle is

852
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,750
anytime you're injured
and you're hobbling along,

853
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,740
you don't want to injure yourself further,

854
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,500
but you want to try and compensate

855
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,840
in the ways that respect this competition

856
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,250
for neural real estate,

857
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,920
and what that usually
means is not relying on

858
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,810
where you're still strong

859
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,290
because that's just going
to create runaway plasticity

860
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,700
that's going to make it very hard

861
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,140
for you to recover the motor function,

862
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,880
and in some cases, the sensory function,

863
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,660
of the damaged limb.

864
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,530
Some of you may be wondering

865
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,870
how long and how often one
should restrict the activity

866
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,550
of the intact or healthy limb,

867
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,320
or limbs in some cases,

868
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,430
and the answer is

869
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,260
you don't have to do
that all day, every day.

870
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,290
These experiments centered on

871
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,000
doing one or two hours of dedicated work,

872
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,140
sensory motor work or,

873
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,150
so for instance, if you had
a sprained ankle on the left,

874
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,270
you might spend part of the
day where your left leg,

875
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,083
provided it's not too
painful, can be exercised,

876
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,840
again, in a way that's not
damaging to the injury,

877
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,830
and the right limb can't
contribute to that exercise.

878
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,380
This might be peddling unilaterally

879
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,150
on a stationary bike if you can do that.

880
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,440
For a different type of limb
injury, like an arm injury,

881
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,590
this might be reaching,

882
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,010
provided the shoulder is
mobile, doing reaching.

883
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,910
It might be even writing
with the damaged side

884
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,950
and then intentionally not writing

885
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,523
with the preferred or undamaged side.

886
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,610
This has been shown to
accelerate the central plasticity

887
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,350
and the recovery of function,

888
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,430
which I think is what most people want

889
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,390
when people are injured.

890
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,560
They want to get back to doing

891
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,010
what they were doing previously

892
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,113
and they want to be able
to do that without pain.

893
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,760
This brings up another topic,

894
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,440
which is definitely related
to neuroplasticity and injury

895
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,870
but is a more general one
that I hear about a lot,

896
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,320
which is traumatic brain injury.

897
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,830
Many injuries are not just about the limb

898
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,880
and the lack of use of the limb

899
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,940
but concussion and head injury,

900
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,330
and I want to emphasize
I'm not a neurologist.

901
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,420
I have many colleagues that are.

902
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,800
At some point, we will
do a whole month on TBI

903
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,550
because it's such a serious issue

904
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,363
and it's such a huge discussion,

905
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,930
but I want to talk a little bit about

906
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,130
what is known about
recovery from concussion,

907
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,850
and this is very important
because it has implications

908
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,540
for just normal aging as well

909
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,210
and offsetting some of
the cognitive decline

910
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,983
and physical decline that
occurs with normal aging.

911
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,470
We shouldn't think of TBI as
just for the football players

912
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,080
or just for the kids that had an injury

913
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,770
or just for the person that
was in the car accident.

914
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,040
We want to learn about TBI

915
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,100
and understand TBI for those folks,

916
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,230
but we're also going to talk about TBI

917
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,510
as it relates to general
degradation of brain function

918
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,030
because there's a
certain resemblance there

919
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,910
of TBI to general brain aging.

920
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,120
Typically after TBI,

921
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,600
there are a number of
different things that happen

922
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,053
and there are a huge range of
things that can create TBI.

923
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,030
Neurologists and the
emergency room physicians

924
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,130
are going to want to know

925
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:38,930
was the skull itself injured

926
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,203
or did the brain rattle
around in the skull?

927
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,310
Was there actually a
breach through the skull?

928
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,600
Is there a physical object in there?

929
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,510
How many concussions has the person had?

930
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,750
Everyone's situation with
TBI is incredibly different,

931
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,540
but there's a constellation of symptoms

932
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,670
that many people, if
not all people with TBI,

933
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,880
report which is headache,

934
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,920
photophobia, that lights become aversive,

935
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,330
sleep disruption, trouble concentrating,

936
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,720
sometimes mood issues.

937
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,970
There's a huge range

938
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,623
and of course the severity
will vary, et cetera.

939
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,130
In a previous episode, I
mentioned the Kennard Principle.

940
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,480
The Kennard Principle,

941
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,930
named after the famous neurologist,

942
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,640
named by and after the famous
neurologist Margaret Kennard,

943
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,120
said that if you're going
to get a brain injury,

944
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,220
better to get it early in
life than later in life

945
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,080
and that's because the
brain has a much greater

946
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,620
or heightened capacity
for repairing itself

947
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,340
early in life than later,

948
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,320
but of course, none of us want TBI

949
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,260
and you can't pick when you get your TBI.

950
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,050
You can avoid certain activities
that would give you TBI,

951
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,230
but really, when it comes to TBI,

952
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,350
there are a couple of things that are

953
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,040
agreed upon across the board.

954
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,120
The first one is,

955
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,990
as much as possible you want to avoid

956
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,180
a second traumatic brain
injury or concussion.

957
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,720
That's going to be a tough
one for some of the athletes

958
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,480
and even recreational athletes to swallow

959
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,300
because they want to
continue in their sport,

960
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,690
and I'm not here to tell you

961
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,770
that you should or you shouldn't,

962
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:07,310
but that's simply the way that it is.

963
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,940
For folks that are in military

964
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,440
or that are in certain professions,

965
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,350
construction is a place
where we see a lot of TBI.

966
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,710
It's not always just football.

967
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,010
A lot of construction workers
are dealing with heavy objects

968
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,890
swinging around in space.

969
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,520
They wear those hardhat helmets,

970
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,380
which unfortunately don't protect much

971
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,000
against a lot of those blunt forces

972
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,880
and certainly not against
falls and things of that sort.

973
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,390
Many people, in order to
survive and feed their families,

974
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,603
have to go back to work.

975
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,180
It's very clear that
regardless of whether or not

976
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,310
there was a skull break

977
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,440
and regardless of when the TBI happened

978
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,770
and how many times it's happened,

979
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,543
that the system that repairs
the brain, the adult brain,

980
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,540
is mainly centered around
this lymphatic system

981
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,833
that we call, for the brain,
the glymphatic system.

982
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,940
The brain wasn't thought
to have a lymphatic system.

983
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,300
It wasn't thought to have
circulating immune cells,

984
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,860
but about 10 years ago it
was sort of rediscovered

985
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,930
because if you look in the literature

986
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,750
you realize this stuff was around longer,

987
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,040
that there's a glymphatic system.

988
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,630
It's sort of like a sewer
system that clears out

989
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,820
the debris that surrounds neurons,

990
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,390
especially injured neurons,

991
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,520
and the glymphatic system
is very active during sleep.

992
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,950
It's been imaged in functional
magnetic resonance imaging

993
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,620
and the glymphatic system is something

994
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,000
that you want very active

995
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,790
because it's going to
clear away the debris

996
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,940
that sits between the neurons,

997
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,480
and the cells that surround

998
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,470
the connections between the
neurons, called the glia,

999
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,290
those cells are actively involved

1000
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,923
in repairing the connections
between neurons when damaged.

1001
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,930
The glymphatic system is so important

1002
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,820
that many people, if not
all people who get TBI,

1003
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,790
are told, "Get adequate
rest, you need to sleep,"

1004
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,140
and that's kind of twofold advice.

1005
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,230
On the one hand, it's
telling you to get sleep

1006
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,300
because all these good
things happen in sleep.

1007
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,180
It's also about getting those people

1008
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,910
to not continue to engage
in their activity full time

1009
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,710
or really try and hammer through it.

1010
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,040
You might say, "Well, if
you have trouble sleeping,

1011
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,120
how are you supposed to get deep sleep?"

1012
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,140
Most of the activity of
the glymphatic system,

1013
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,630
this wash out of the debris,

1014
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,130
is occurring during slow-wave sleep.

1015
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:18,130
Slow-wave sleep, as I mentioned
in a previous episode,

1016
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,260
is something that happens typically

1017
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,550
in the early part of the evening.

1018
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,120
Even for those of you that are falling,

1019
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,520
or early part of the night, rather,

1020
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,910
if you're falling asleep
and then waking up

1021
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,930
three, four hours later,

1022
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,750
it's important that you
continue to get sleep

1023
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,640
but know that the slow-wave sleep

1024
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,640
is mainly packed toward the
early part of the night,

1025
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,540
so that hopefully will
alleviate some of the anxiety

1026
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,100
of the 3:00 and 4:00 am wake up,

1027
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,810
although you really should follow

1028
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,410
some of the protocols that I've suggested

1029
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,660
and your physician's protocols

1030
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,090
in order to try and get
regular, longer sleep

1031
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,360
of seven, eight hours.

1032
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,050
Later, we're going to talk
about the eight-hour mark

1033
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,943
as a prerequisite for repair.

1034
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,920
The glymphatic system has been shown

1035
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,490
to be activated further in two ways.

1036
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,960
One is that sleeping on one side,

1037
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,590
not on back or stomach,

1038
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,540
seems to increase the amount of wash out,

1039
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,520
or wash through, I should say,

1040
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,900
of the glymphatic system.

1041
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,240
There aren't a ton of data on this,

1042
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,110
but the data that exist are pretty solid.

1043
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,210
Again, sleeping on one side

1044
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,420
or with feet slightly elevated, as well,

1045
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,550
has been shown to increase
the rate of clearance

1046
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,830
of some of the debris

1047
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,310
and that's because the way that
the glymphatic system works

1048
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,610
is it has a physical
pressure fluid dynamic to it

1049
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,950
that allow it to work more efficiently

1050
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,490
when one is sleeping on their side

1051
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,290
or with feet slightly elevated.

1052
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,130
This means not falling asleep
in a chair while watching TV.

1053
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,080
This means, if possible,

1054
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,720
not falling asleep on one's
back or on one's stomach,

1055
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,220
sleeping on one's side,

1056
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,590
and if you can't do that,

1057
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,040
I don't really like to sleep on my side.

1058
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,530
I sleep with my feet slightly elevated.

1059
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,590
I put a thin pillow under my ankles.

1060
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:03,590
I don't have TBI, but I have
had a few concussions before,

1061
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,520
but right now I feel fine,

1062
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,230
but I find that putting
the pillow under my ankles

1063
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,060
helps me sleep much more deeply

1064
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,810
and I wake up feeling much more refreshed.

1065
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,490
The other thing that has been shown

1066
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,900
to improve the function
of the glymphatic system,

1067
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,860
and this is, again, is for sake of TBI

1068
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,500
as well as for everyone,
even without brain injury,

1069
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,910
is a certain form of exercise,

1070
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,790
and I want to be very, very clear here.

1071
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,490
I will never and I am not suggesting

1072
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,360
that people exercise in any way

1073
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,150
that aggravates their injury

1074
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,440
or that goes against
their physician's advice.

1075
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,040
Take your physician's advice

1076
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,960
as to whether or not you
should be exercising at all

1077
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,270
and how much and then to what intensity.

1078
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,320
However, there's some interesting data,

1079
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,550
and we can provide a link
to the review on this.

1080
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,770
It shows that exercise of

1081
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,110
what I guess people would
nowadays call it Zone 2 cardio,

1082
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,530
which is low-level
cardio that one could do

1083
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,930
while talking to somebody else.

1084
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,440
You could maintain a conversation,

1085
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,320
although you don't have
to talk to somebody else.

1086
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,020
It just gives you a sense of
the intensity of the exercise.

1087
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,700
That Zone 2 cardio

1088
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,970
for 30 to 45 minutes 3 times a week

1089
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,530
seems to improve the rates of clearance

1090
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,400
of some of the debris after injury,

1091
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,680
and in general, injury or no,

1092
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,810
to accelerate and
improve the rates of flow

1093
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,150
for the glymphatic system.

1094
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,600
I find this really interesting

1095
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,590
because I think nowadays
there's such an obsession

1096
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,770
with high-intensity interval training

1097
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,180
and people trying to pack
in as much as they can

1098
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,410
into a short workout,

1099
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,550
which is great if it
brings people to the table

1100
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,460
who haven't been exercising before,

1101
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,560
but I think it's really
important that we know

1102
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,987
that the data on exercise

1103
00:45:48,987 --> 00:45:51,230
and its relationship to brain health

1104
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,560
speak to doing 30 to 45 minutes

1105
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,960
of this what we call low-level cardio.

1106
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,640
It could be fast walking.

1107
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,950
It could be jogging

1108
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,100
if you can do that with
your injury safely.

1109
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,690
It could be cycling.

1110
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,490
This is not the kind of workout

1111
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,110
that's designed to get your
heart rate up to the point

1112
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,920
where you're improving your fitness levels

1113
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,330
at some sort of massive rate

1114
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,090
or taking huge jumps in your
VO2 max or anything like that.

1115
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,150
This is exercise,

1116
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,060
I do this and I know a
number of other people,

1117
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,210
especially people in communities

1118
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,730
where there is a lot of TBI,

1119
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,040
are now starting to adopt this,

1120
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,450
that the 30 to 45 minutes
3 times a week or so,

1121
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,283
could be more,

1122
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,720
of this Zone 2 type cardio
can be very beneficial

1123
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,870
for washout of debris from the brain,

1124
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,380
and this is really
interesting outside of TBI

1125
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,810
because what we know from aging

1126
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,450
is that aging is a nonlinear process.

1127
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,270
It's not like with every year of life

1128
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,714
your brain gets a little older.

1129
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:51,437
Sometimes it follows what's
more like a step function

1130
00:46:51,437 --> 00:46:55,760
where you get these big
jumps in markers of aging.

1131
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,480
I guess that we could
think of them as jumps down

1132
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,070
because it's a negative
thing for most everybody.

1133
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,850
We'd like to live longer and
be healthier in brain and body,

1134
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,320
and so the types of exercise
I'm referring to now

1135
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,140
are really more about brain longevity

1136
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,380
and about keeping the brain healthy

1137
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,230
than they are about physical fitness.

1138
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,080
There's no reason why you
couldn't do this and also,

1139
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,210
provided, again, it's safe for you

1140
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,863
given your brain state and
injury state, et cetera,

1141
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,860
there's no reason why you
couldn't also combine it

1142
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,410
with weight training and
other forms of cardio.

1143
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,660
I think this is really interesting

1144
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,780
and if some of you would
like to know the mechanism

1145
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,310
or at least the hypothesized mechanism,

1146
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,900
there's a molecule called aquaporin-4.

1147
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,330
It almost sounds like

1148
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:40,980
the fourth in a sequel of
movies or something like that,

1149
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,630
but aquaporin-4 is a molecule

1150
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,970
that is related to the glial system.

1151
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,750
Glia are the, it means glue in Latin,

1152
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,380
are these cells in the brain,

1153
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,360
the most numerous cells
in the brain, in fact,

1154
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,130
that ensheathe synapses, but
they're very dynamic cells.

1155
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,820
They're like little ambulant cells.

1156
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,530
The microglia will run in

1157
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,160
and will gather up debris and soak it up

1158
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,714
and then run out after an injury.

1159
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,080
Aquaporin-4 is mainly expressed

1160
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,940
by the glial cell called the astrocyte.

1161
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,020
Astro, it looks like a little star.

1162
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,740
Incredibly interesting cells

1163
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,770
and the thing to remember is

1164
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,330
that the astrocytes bridge the connection

1165
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,923
between the neurons,

1166
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,040
the synapse, the connections between them,

1167
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,360
and the vasculature, the blood system,

1168
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,286
and the glymphatic system.

1169
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:29,100
They sit at the interface
and they kind of,

1170
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,670
imagine somebody on an
emergency site, car crash site,

1171
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,900
who's directing everybody
around as to what to do.

1172
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,910
Get that person on a
stretcher, bandage them up,

1173
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,910
call their mother, et cetera, et cetera,

1174
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,250
get this out of the road,
put down some flares.

1175
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,470
The astrocytes work in that capacity

1176
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,620
as well as doing some
things more directly.

1177
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,900
This glymphatic system and
the glial astrocyte system

1178
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,840
is a system that we
want chronically active

1179
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,950
throughout the day as much as possible,

1180
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,050
so low-level walking, Zone 2 cardio,

1181
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,300
and then at night, during slow-wave sleep,

1182
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,193
is then really when this
glymphatic system kicks in.

1183
00:49:02,193 --> 00:49:04,790
That should hopefully be
an actionable takeaway,

1184
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,440
provided that you can do
that kind of cardio safely,

1185
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,710
that I believe everybody should be doing

1186
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,270
who cares about brain longevity,

1187
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,743
not just people who are
trying to get over TBI.

1188
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,490
Now I'd like to return a little bit

1189
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,710
to some of the subjective
aspects of pain modulation

1190
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,180
because I think it's so
interesting and so actionable

1191
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,840
that everyone should know about this,

1192
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,020
and in this case,

1193
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,160
we can also say that
regardless of whether or not

1194
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,200
you're experiencing
pain, acute or chronic,

1195
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,990
what I'm about to tell you

1196
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:39,870
is as close as anything is to proof,

1197
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,620
in science, we rarely talk about proof,

1198
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,930
we talk about evidence in
favor or against a hypothesis,

1199
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,600
but as close as possible to proof

1200
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,730
that our interpretation,

1201
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,420
our subjective interpretation
of a sensory event

1202
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,780
is immensely powerful

1203
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,333
for dictating our experience of the event.

1204
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,710
Here are a couple examples.

1205
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,150
First of all,

1206
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,690
anyone who's ever done
combat sports or martial arts

1207
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,960
knows that it's incredible

1208
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,850
how little a punch hurts during a fight

1209
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:15,170
and it's incredible how
much it hurts after a fight.

1210
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,870
The molecule adrenaline,

1211
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,893
when it's liberated into our body,

1212
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,023
truly blunts our experience of pain.

1213
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,630
We all know the stories of people

1214
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,810
walking miles on stumped legs,

1215
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,260
people doing all sorts of things

1216
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,110
that were incredible feats

1217
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,580
that allowed them to move through

1218
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,080
what would otherwise be pain,

1219
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,700
and afterward they do
experience extreme pain,

1220
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,640
but during the event oftentimes

1221
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,440
they are not experiencing
pain and that's because of

1222
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,020
the pain-blunting effects of adrenaline.

1223
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,570
I'll tell you exactly how
this works in a few minutes

1224
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,440
when we talk about acupuncture,

1225
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,940
but norepinephrine binding
to particular receptors,

1226
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,890
adrenaline binding to particular receptors

1227
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,503
actually shuts down pain pathways.

1228
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,460
People who anticipate
an injection of morphine

1229
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,460
immediately report the
feeling of loss of pain.

1230
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,980
Their pain starts to diminish

1231
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,040
because they know they're
going to get pain relief

1232
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,227
and it's a powerful effect.

1233
00:51:17,227 --> 00:51:19,480
All of you are probably
saying placebo effect.

1234
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,270
Placebo effects are very real.

1235
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,340
Placebo effects and belief
effects, as they're called,

1236
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,700
have a profound effect on our experience

1237
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,430
of noxious stimuli like pain

1238
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,540
and they can also have a profound
effect on positive stimuli

1239
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,060
and things that we're looking forward to.

1240
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,910
One study that I think is
particularly interesting here,

1241
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,820
it's from my colleague
at Stanford, Sean Mackey.

1242
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,610
They did a neuroimaging study.

1243
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,050
They subjected people to pain.

1244
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,270
In this case, it was a heat pain.

1245
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,830
People have very specific
thresholds to heat

1246
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,810
at which they cannot
tolerate any more heat,

1247
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,620
but they explored the extent to which

1248
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,030
looking at an image of somebody,

1249
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,780
in this case, a romantic
partner that the person loved,

1250
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:02,163
would allow them to adjust
their pain response,

1251
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,150
and it turns out it does.

1252
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,130
If people are looking at an image

1253
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,550
or thinking about a person that they love,

1254
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:14,450
or even a thing that they
love, a pet that they love,

1255
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,630
studies previous to the one
that Mackey and colleagues did

1256
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,020
showed that their experience
of pain was reduced.

1257
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,090
Their threshold for pain was higher.

1258
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,400
They could tolerate more pain

1259
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,563
and they reported it as not as painful,

1260
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,310
but there's a twist there
which is it turns out

1261
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:36,310
that the extent to which
love will modulate pain

1262
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,720
has everything to do with how infatuated

1263
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,550
and obsessed somebody is with
the object of their love.

1264
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:49,300
People that report thinking
about somebody, or a pet,

1265
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,560
for many hours of the day,

1266
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,640
kind of having an obsessive nature,

1267
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,360
almost like what people might call

1268
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,890
quote, unquote, codependency.

1269
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:58,830
For those of you that are listening,

1270
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,130
I'm just providing air quotes

1271
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,240
'cause codependency is kind
of a clinical thing now

1272
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,500
although it's thrown
around a lot all the time.

1273
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,570
It's sort of like gaslighting.

1274
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,210
People talk about
gaslighting all the time now.

1275
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,890
Gaslighting is a real thing

1276
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,580
but then people talked about gaslighting

1277
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,933
for many things outside
the clinical description.

1278
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,370
If people are very obsessed with somebody,

1279
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,440
they have a kind of obsessive
love of somebody's face,

1280
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,960
even if the other person
doesn't know them,

1281
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,160
which is a little weird,

1282
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,630
that response, that
feeling of love internally

1283
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:34,200
can blunt the pain experience
to a significant degree.

1284
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,320
These are not small effects.

1285
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,850
It's not just that love
can protect us from pain.

1286
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,160
It's that infatuation and obsession

1287
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,330
can protect us from pain,

1288
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,270
and not surprisingly,

1289
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,400
how early a relationship is,
how new a relationship is

1290
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,530
directly correlates with
people's ability, they showed,

1291
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,900
to use this love, this internal
representation of love,

1292
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,463
to blunt the pain response.

1293
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,340
For those of you that have
been with your partners

1294
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,180
for many years and you love them very much

1295
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,220
and you're obsessed with them, terrific.

1296
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,470
You have a pre-installed,

1297
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,590
well, I suppose it's not pre-installed.

1298
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,500
You had to do the work because
relationships are work,

1299
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,100
but you've got a installed
mechanism for blunting pain,

1300
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,440
and again, these are not minor effects.

1301
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,460
These are major effects

1302
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,940
and it's all going to be
through that top-down modulation

1303
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,773
that we talked about,

1304
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:24,410
not unlike the mirror box
experiments with phantom limb

1305
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,250
that relieve phantom pain

1306
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,070
or some other top-down modulation,

1307
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,330
and the opposite example was
the nail through the boot,

1308
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,590
which is a visual image
that made the person think

1309
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,930
it was painful when in fact

1310
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,010
it was painful even though
there was no tissue damage.

1311
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,170
It was all perceptual.

1312
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:41,940
The pain system is really subject

1313
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,510
to these perceptual influences,

1314
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,470
which is remarkable because, really,

1315
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,220
when we think about the
somatosensory system,

1316
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,530
it has this cognitive component,

1317
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,260
it's got this peripheral component,

1318
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,290
but there's another component

1319
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,750
which is the way in which our sensation,

1320
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,410
our somatosensory system is woven in

1321
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,360
with our autonomic nervous system,

1322
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,660
and we're going to get to that next,

1323
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,780
but I want to just raise the idea

1324
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,390
that the reason that
this kind of infatuation

1325
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,600
and obsessive love can
blunt the pain response

1326
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,280
and increase one's threshold for pain

1327
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,190
may have to do,

1328
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,770
I would say almost certainly has to do,

1329
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,100
but it hasn't been measured yet,

1330
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,530
with dopamine release

1331
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,190
because dopamine is
absolutely the molecule

1332
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,610
that's liberated in our brain and body

1333
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,930
when there's a new kind of
obsession or infatuation.

1334
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:34,500
It's very distinct from
the kind of love chemicals,

1335
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,140
if you will,

1336
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,740
I don't even like calling
them love chemicals.

1337
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,650
That just feels weird.

1338
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,440
If this were text, I
would delete that line,

1339
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,710
but from the chemicals associated

1340
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,410
with warmth and connection,

1341
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,600
such as serotonin and oxytocin,

1342
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,650
which tend to be for more stable,

1343
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,940
long-lasting relationships.

1344
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,650
Dopamine is what dilates the pupils,

1345
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,850
which gets people really excited.

1346
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,470
They can't stop thinking about somebody.

1347
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,610
The text messages are even exciting.

1348
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,920
They write to them and they can't wait

1349
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,400
for the text message to come back,

1350
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,810
the dot dot dot on the screen.

1351
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,690
The text message is excruciating.

1352
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,250
They don't respond for two minutes

1353
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,640
and people are getting flipped out.

1354
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,360
I'm not here to support
that kind of whatever,

1355
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,700
what I'm saying is that

1356
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,270
that obsessive type of love,

1357
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,030
which without question

1358
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:19,880
is going to be associated
with the dopamine pathway,

1359
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,480
does seem to have a
utility in the context of

1360
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,380
reducing the unpleasantness
of physical pain,

1361
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,610
and probably has a lot to do

1362
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,590
with reducing the
unpleasantness of a lot of life,

1363
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,960
like sitting in traffic, et cetera,

1364
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,950
because when we talk about pain,

1365
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,530
emotional pain and physical pain

1366
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,560
start to become one in the same.

1367
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,030
They are so closely intertwined

1368
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,740
that the lines between them
neurally become very blurry.

1369
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,840
What do I mean by that?

1370
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,200
Well, if love and infatuation

1371
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,160
can reduce pain,

1372
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,030
presumably through the
release of dopamine,

1373
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,440
well, then does dopamine
release itself blunt pain?

1374
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,390
Should we be chasing dopamine release

1375
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,530
as a way to treat chronic and acute pain?

1376
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,810
And that's exactly what we're
going to talk about now.

1377
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:04,890
Independent of love,

1378
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,460
we're going to talk about
something quite different

1379
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,590
which is putting needles and electricity

1380
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,060
in different parts of the
body, so-called acupuncture.

1381
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,203
Something that, for many people,

1382
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,280
it's been viewed as a kind
of alternative medicine,

1383
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,600
but now there are excellent
laboratories exploring

1384
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,130
what's called electroacupuncture
and acupuncture.

1385
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,690
These are big university centers.

1386
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:30,210
In fact, my source for everything
I'm about to tell you next

1387
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,430
is Professor Qiufu Ma at
Harvard Medical School

1388
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,340
and his papers.

1389
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,630
I stand behind the information
that I'm going to provide today,

1390
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:40,760
but it's extracted largely
from the Ma lab's papers

1391
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,760
which use very rigorous
variable-isolating experiments

1392
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,560
to address just how does
something like acupuncture work,

1393
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,320
and I think what you'll be interested in

1394
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,900
and surprised to learn
is that it does work,

1395
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,060
but sometimes it can exacerbate pain

1396
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,250
and sometimes it can relieve pain

1397
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,780
and it all does that through
very discrete pathways

1398
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,957
for which we can really say,

1399
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:05,500
"This neuron connects to that neuron

1400
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,470
connects to the adrenals,"

1401
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,850
and we can tie this all back to dopamine

1402
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,390
because in the end it's the
chemicals and neural circuits

1403
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,410
that are giving rise to these perceptions,

1404
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,010
or these experiences, rather,

1405
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,650
of things that we call
pain, love, et cetera.

1406
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,540
In a previous podcast episode,

1407
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,260
I mentioned my experience
of visiting an acupuncturist

1408
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,320
and getting acupuncture.

1409
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,100
The acupuncture itself

1410
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,130
didn't really do that much for me,

1411
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,910
but I wasn't there for
any specific reason.

1412
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,320
It was gifted to me by somebody
and I wanted to try it.

1413
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,780
I'm not passing judgment on acupuncture.

1414
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,170
In fact, I know a number of people

1415
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,440
that really derive tremendous
benefit from acupuncture

1416
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,670
for pain and for gastrointestinal issues.

1417
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,800
There are actually a lot of

1418
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,010
really good peer-reviewed studies

1419
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,730
supporting the use of
acupuncture for, in particular,

1420
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,193
GI tract issues.

1421
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,840
In recent years, there's
been an emphasis on

1422
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,600
trying to understand the mechanism

1423
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,180
of things like acupuncture
and acupuncture itself,

1424
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,250
not to support acupuncture

1425
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,140
or to try to get everybody
to do acupuncture

1426
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,780
but as a way to try and understand

1427
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,880
how these sorts of practices

1428
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,100
might actually benefit people
who are experiencing pain

1429
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,720
or for changing the nervous system

1430
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,300
or brain-body relationship in general,

1431
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,133
and actually,

1432
00:59:19,133 --> 00:59:22,500
the National Institutes of
Health in the United States

1433
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,640
now has a entire subdivision,

1434
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,573
an institute within the
National Institutes of Health,

1435
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,210
which is complementary health,

1436
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,880
and that institute is interested
in things like acupuncture

1437
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,437
and a variety of other
practices that, I think,

1438
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:41,930
10, 15 years ago people probably thought

1439
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,177
were really alternative and
maybe even counterculture,

1440
00:59:45,177 --> 00:59:47,280
at least in the States, and it's exciting.

1441
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,310
I think people are starting
to really take a look at

1442
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,370
what's going on under the hood

1443
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,860
for certain types of
treatments that are very useful

1444
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,570
and I think it's very likely to lead

1445
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,510
to an expanded number of treatments

1446
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,360
for a number of different conditions.

1447
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,830
What I want to talk about
in terms of acupuncture

1448
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:06,570
is the incredible way in
which acupuncture illuminates

1449
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,670
the crosstalk between
the somatosensory system,

1450
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,880
our ability to feel stuff

1451
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,890
externally, exteroception,

1452
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,820
internally, interoception,

1453
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,530
and how that somatosensory system

1454
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,440
is wired in with and communicating

1455
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,010
with our autonomic nervous system

1456
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,963
that regulates our levels
of alertness or calmness.

1457
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,990
After that, I'm going to talk about

1458
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:34,640
how the acupuncture that's
being done right now

1459
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,283
also points to relief for
what's called referred pain.

1460
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,100
This takes us all back to the
homunculus. Let's start there.

1461
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,690
We have this representation
of our body surface

1462
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:45,893
in our brain.

1463
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,023
That representation is
what we call somatotopic,

1464
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,390
and what somatotopy is

1465
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,510
is it just means that areas of your body

1466
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:56,800
that are near one another,

1467
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,260
so your thumb and your
forefinger, for instance,

1468
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:02,190
are represented by neurons
that are nearby each other

1469
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,023
in the brain.

1470
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,460
You might say, "Well, duh,"

1471
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,010
but actually, it didn't
have to be that way.

1472
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,110
The neurons that represent
the tip of my forefinger

1473
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,660
and the neurons that represent
my thumb on the same hand

1474
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,790
could have been distantly located

1475
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,570
and therefore the map of my
body surface, the homunculus,

1476
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:18,650
would be really disordered,
but it's not that way.

1477
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,900
It's very ordered. It's very smooth.

1478
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,830
As, let's say you were to image my brain,

1479
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,980
if you were to stimulate
my finger, my forefinger,

1480
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:27,270
and then march that
stimulation across my finger,

1481
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:29,660
across the palm and to the nearby thumb,

1482
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,150
you would see that neurons in the brain

1483
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,920
would also make a sort of J shape

1484
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,470
in their pattern of activation.

1485
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,920
That means there's so-called somatotopy,

1486
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,550
but the connections
from those brain neurons

1487
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,400
are sent into the body

1488
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,380
and they are synchronized with,

1489
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,470
meaning they cross-wire with

1490
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:52,260
and form synapses with some of the input

1491
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,750
from the viscera, from our guts,

1492
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,970
from our diaphragm, from our stomach,

1493
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:00,410
from our spleen, from our heart.

1494
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,820
Our internal organs
are sending information

1495
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,160
up to this map in our
brain of the body surface,

1496
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,870
but it's about internal information,

1497
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,380
what we call interoception,

1498
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,810
our ability to look
inside or imagine inside

1499
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,653
and feel what we're feeling inside.

1500
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,060
The way to think about this accurately

1501
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,690
is that our representation of ourself

1502
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:22,650
is a representation of
our internal workings,

1503
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,300
our viscera, our guts,
everything inside our skin,

1504
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,400
and the surface of our skin,

1505
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,140
and the external world, what we're seeing.

1506
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,960
Those three things are
always being combined

1507
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,143
in a very interesting,
complex but very seamless way.

1508
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,540
Acupuncture involves taking needles,

1509
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,720
and sometimes electricity
and or heat as well,

1510
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,250
and stimulating particular
locations on the body

1511
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,960
and through these maps of stimulation

1512
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,910
that have been developed
over thousands of years,

1513
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,313
mostly in Asia,

1514
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,530
but now this is a
practice that's being done

1515
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,430
many places throughout the world,

1516
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,520
they have these maps that speak to,

1517
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,480
oh, well, if you stimulate
this part of the body,

1518
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,510
you get this response,

1519
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,350
and if somebody has a
gastrointestinal issue,

1520
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,930
like their guts are moving
too quick, they have diarrhea,

1521
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,010
you stimulate this area

1522
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:12,880
and it'll slow their gut motility down,

1523
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,540
or if their gut motility is
too slow, they're constipated,

1524
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,710
you stimulate someplace
else and it accelerates it,

1525
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,330
and hearing about this
stuff, it sounds kind of,

1526
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,680
to a Westerner who's not thinking about

1527
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,330
the underlying neural circuitry,

1528
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,770
it could sound kind of wacky.

1529
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,210
It really sounds like alternative

1530
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,790
or even really out there stuff,

1531
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,390
but when you look at the neural
circuitry, the neuroanatomy,

1532
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,590
it really starts to make sense,

1533
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,870
and Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School

1534
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:39,820
is an excellent laboratory,

1535
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,910
has been exploring how
stimulation of different types,

1536
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:47,740
intense or weak, with
heat or without heat,

1537
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,120
on different parts of the body

1538
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:53,680
can modulate pain and inflammation,

1539
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,990
and what they've shown in a
particularly exciting study

1540
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,193
is that stimulation of the abdomen,

1541
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,240
anywhere on the midsection,

1542
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,247
weakly does nothing.

1543
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:08,230
"Well, that's not very
interesting," you might say.

1544
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:11,110
Intense stimulation of
the abdomen, however,

1545
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:14,940
with this electroacupuncture
has a very strong effect

1546
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,690
of increasing inflammation in the body,

1547
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,840
and this is important to understand

1548
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,450
because it's not just that
stimulating the gut does this

1549
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:28,150
because you're activating the gut area.

1550
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,980
It activates a particular nerve pathway.

1551
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,940
For the aficionados,

1552
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,550
it's the splenic spinal sympathetic axis

1553
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,650
if you really want to know,

1554
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:40,070
and it's pro-inflammatory
under most conditions.

1555
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,300
However, there are other
conditions where if, for instance,

1556
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,330
the person is dealing with a
particular bacterial infection,

1557
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,160
that can be beneficial,

1558
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,060
and this goes back to a
much earlier discussion

1559
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,530
that we had on a previous podcast

1560
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,430
that we'll revisit again and again,

1561
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,130
which is that the stress response

1562
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:58,250
was designed to combat infection.

1563
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,200
It turns out that there
are certain patterns

1564
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,600
of stimulation on the abdomen

1565
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,090
that can actually liberate immune cells

1566
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:07,120
from our immune organs, like our spleen,

1567
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,900
and counter infection

1568
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,670
through the release of
things like adrenaline.

1569
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,760
Qiufu's lab also showed

1570
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,760
that stimulation of the feet and hands

1571
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,330
can reduce inflammation,

1572
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,420
and again, this was done mechanistically.

1573
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,300
This was done by blocking certain pathways

1574
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,430
with the appropriate control experiments.

1575
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:32,020
This was done not in any
kind of subjective way.

1576
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,820
This was also done by
measuring particular molecules,

1577
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,440
IL-6 and cytokines

1578
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,140
and things that are related
to the inflammation response,

1579
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,830
and what they showed is
that the stimulation of the,

1580
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:46,830
in particular, the hind
limbs at low intensity

1581
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,420
led to increases in the
activity of this vagal pathway.

1582
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,380
The vagus nerve being
this 10th cranial nerve

1583
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,270
that serves the rest and
digest and parasympathetic,

1584
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,420
in other words, calming response.

1585
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,980
What this means is that we
are now at the front edge

1586
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,993
of this research field that's,

1587
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,130
it's early days still,

1588
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,060
but it's discovering that
depending on whether or not

1589
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,050
the stimulation is intense or mild

1590
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,310
and depending on where the
stimulation is done on the body

1591
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:15,270
you can get very different effects.

1592
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:18,410
This points to the idea that
you can't say acupuncture good

1593
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,070
or acupuncture bad.

1594
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:23,360
There has to be a
systematic understanding of

1595
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,340
what exactly the effect is
that you're trying to achieve

1596
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,860
and the underlying basis
for this is really relevant

1597
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,540
to the thing about adrenaline
that I said before,

1598
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,840
that in a fight,

1599
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,580
it's rare that you ever
feel pain when you get hit,

1600
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,270
I've experienced that,

1601
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,500
but later it hurts a lot.

1602
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,990
It turns out that when you
stimulate these pathways

1603
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:43,980
that activate, in
particular, the adrenals,

1604
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,480
the adrenal gland liberates
norepinephrine and epinephrine

1605
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,180
and the brain does as well,

1606
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,220
it binds to what are called

1607
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,610
the beta noradrenergic receptors.

1608
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,540
This is really getting
down into the weeds,

1609
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,010
but the beta noradrenergic
receptors activate the spleen

1610
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,210
which liberates cells
that combat infection

1611
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,960
and it's anti-inflammatory.

1612
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,690
That's the short-term quick response.

1613
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:11,660
The more intense stimulation
of the abdomen and other areas

1614
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,050
can be pro-inflammatory

1615
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:16,990
because of the ways that
they trigger certain loops

1616
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:20,540
that go back to the brain and
trigger the anxiety pathways

1617
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,470
and that place people
into a state of anxiety

1618
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:24,890
that exacerbates pain.

1619
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:26,940
One pathway stimulates
norepinephrine and blunts pain,

1620
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,780
the other one doesn't.

1621
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,810
What does all this mean?

1622
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,860
How are we supposed to
put all of this together?

1623
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,190
Well, there's a paper that was published

1624
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,783
in "Nature Medicine" in 2014,

1625
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,920
this is an excellent journal,

1626
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,500
that describes how dopamine

1627
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,300
can activate the vagus
peripherally in the,

1628
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,343
not dopamine in the brain, peripherally,

1629
01:07:45,343 --> 01:07:49,300
and norepinephrine can
activate the vagus peripherally

1630
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,840
and reduce inflammation,

1631
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,977
and I'm not trying to throw
a ton of facts at you.

1632
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:54,410
You'll say, "Well, what
am I supposed to do

1633
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:55,300
with all this information?"

1634
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,300
What this means is that

1635
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,350
there are real maps of our body surface

1636
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,740
that when stimulated

1637
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,170
communicate with our
autonomic nervous system,

1638
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,830
the system that controls
alertness or calmness,

1639
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:09,620
and thereby releases either molecules

1640
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,010
like norepinephrine and dopamine,

1641
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:15,030
which make us more alert,
as we would be in a fight,

1642
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:17,510
and blunt our response to pain

1643
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,370
and they reduce inflammation,

1644
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,710
but there are yet other
pathways that when stimulated

1645
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,229
are pro-inflammatory,

1646
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:26,509
and that brings us to the question of

1647
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:28,340
what is all this inflammation stuff

1648
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,220
that people are talking about?

1649
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:32,720
One of the things that
bothers me so much these days,

1650
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,189
and I'm not easily irritated,

1651
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:36,459
but what really bothers me is when people

1652
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,640
are talking about inflammation
like inflammation is bad.

1653
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:39,920
Inflammation is terrific.

1654
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,319
Inflammation is the reason
why cells are called

1655
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,229
to the site of injury to clear it out.

1656
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,209
Inflammation is what's going to allow you

1657
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,930
to heal from any injury.

1658
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,109
Chronic inflammation is bad,

1659
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:53,009
but acute inflammation
is absolutely essential.

1660
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,950
Remember those kids that
we talked about earlier

1661
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,859
that have mutations in these
receptors for sensing pain?

1662
01:08:57,859 --> 01:08:59,199
They never get inflammation

1663
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,290
and that's why their joints
literally disintegrate.

1664
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,260
It's really horrible

1665
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,830
because they don't actually
have the inflammation response

1666
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:10,340
because it was never triggered
by the pain response.

1667
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,359
Inflammation can be very beneficial.

1668
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,279
There's a lot of interest nowadays

1669
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,989
in taking things and doing
things to limit inflammation.

1670
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,970
One of the ones that comes
up a lot is turmeric.

1671
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:21,830
I'm sure the moment anyone
starts talking about

1672
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,620
inflammation the question
is, "What about turmeric?"

1673
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,590
I have talked before
about turmeric elsewhere.

1674
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:30,700
I am very skeptical of turmeric

1675
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,520
and I might lose a few friends,

1676
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,279
although that'd be weird if my friend,

1677
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:35,599
that would say something
about my friendships

1678
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,380
if I lost friends over a
discussion about turmeric,

1679
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,000
but in any case,

1680
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,300
turmeric does have
anti-inflammatory properties,

1681
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,520
there's no question about that,

1682
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,040
but as we've just described,

1683
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,550
inflammation can be a very good thing,

1684
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:50,850
at least in the short term.

1685
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,229
The other thing about turmeric is

1686
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,580
there was a study
published out of Stanford

1687
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,610
in collection with some
work from other universities

1688
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,930
showing that a lot of turmeric

1689
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:01,340
is heavily contaminated with lead.

1690
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,910
The lead is used to get

1691
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:06,980
that really rich, dense,
orange coloring to it

1692
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,280
that everyone wants to see,

1693
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,060
so you have to check
your sources of turmeric.

1694
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:13,700
The other thing is, for men in particular,

1695
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,860
turmeric can be very antagonistic
to dihydrotestosterone.

1696
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,210
Dihydrotestosterone is
the more dominant form

1697
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:23,830
of androgen in human males

1698
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:27,120
and it's involved in things
like aggression and libido

1699
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,380
and things of that sort.

1700
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,210
Many people that I've talked
to who have have taken turmeric

1701
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:36,000
get a severe blunting
of affect and libido.

1702
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,110
For some people that might
be a serious negative.

1703
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,760
I certainly avoid turmeric.

1704
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,360
I don't like turmeric for that reason.

1705
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,130
I also think that the
inflammation response

1706
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,763
is a healthy response.

1707
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,740
You have to keep it in check

1708
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,440
and we're going to talk
about specific practices

1709
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,780
for wound healing and injury in a moment,

1710
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,950
but this idea that just
inflammation is bad

1711
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,760
and you want to reduce
inflammation across the board,

1712
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,350
nothing could be further from the truth.

1713
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,920
We have pathways that exist in our body

1714
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,963
specifically to increase inflammation.

1715
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,810
It's the inflammation that goes
unchecked, just like stress,

1716
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:11,410
which is problematic for
repair, for brain injury,

1717
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:14,610
and it can exacerbate certain
forms of dementia, et cetera,

1718
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,760
but I'd like to create
a little bit more nuance

1719
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,320
or a lot more nuance, if possible,

1720
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,770
in the conversation around inflammation

1721
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:22,950
because people have just taken

1722
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,190
this discussion around
inflammation to be this idea

1723
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,900
that just inflammation is bad

1724
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,490
and nothing could be
further from the truth.

1725
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,350
Before I continue,

1726
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,260
I just thought I'd answer
a question that I get a lot

1727
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,060
which is what about Wim Hof breathing?

1728
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,140
I get asked about this a lot.

1729
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,680
Wim Hof, also called aka The Iceman,

1730
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,620
has this breathing that's
similar to Tummo breathing,

1731
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,730
as it was originally called,

1732
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:47,530
involves basically hyperventilating

1733
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,660
and then doing some exhales
and some breath holds.

1734
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,700
A couple of things about that.

1735
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,690
It should never be done near water.

1736
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:53,830
People who have done it near water

1737
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,180
unfortunately have drowned.

1738
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,650
It's certainly not for everybody

1739
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:01,480
and I'm not here to either promote it

1740
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,570
nor discourage people from doing it,

1741
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,757
but I think we should ask ourselves,

1742
01:12:04,757 --> 01:12:06,210
"What is the net effect of that?"

1743
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,320
Because a number of people
have asked me about it

1744
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,900
in relation to pain management.

1745
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,140
The effect of doing
that kind of breathing,

1746
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,420
it's not a mysterious effect.

1747
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,390
It liberates adrenaline from the adrenals.

1748
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,223
There is a paper published in

1749
01:12:18,223 --> 01:12:20,300
the "Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,"

1750
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,660
which is a very fine journal,

1751
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,520
showing that that breathing pattern

1752
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,510
can counter infection from endotoxin

1753
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,450
and that's because when you
have adrenaline in your system

1754
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,273
and when the spleen is very active,

1755
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:36,970
that response is used to counter infection

1756
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:39,850
and stress counters infection.

1757
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:41,450
We'll talk about this more going forward,

1758
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:44,740
but the idea that stress lends
itself to infection is false.

1759
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,380
Stress counters infection

1760
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:49,240
by liberating killer cells in the body.

1761
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,360
You don't want the stress response

1762
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,583
to stay on indefinitely, however.

1763
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,310
Things like Wim Hof
breathing, like ice baths,

1764
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,790
anything that releases adrenaline

1765
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,343
will counter the infection,

1766
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,480
but you want to regulate the duration

1767
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,230
of that adrenaline response.

1768
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,190
This should make perfect sense.

1769
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,720
We, as a species,

1770
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,790
had to evolve under
conditions of famine and cold.

1771
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:10,880
Actually, Texas right now

1772
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,580
is an extreme case of
cold and power outage.

1773
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,450
I've seen the pictures and
a lot of people out there

1774
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,120
are really suffering.

1775
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,720
Their systems are releasing
a ton of adrenaline.

1776
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,850
They're cold. Some of them
are likely to be hungry.

1777
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,373
They're probably stressed.

1778
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,950
They're releasing a lot of adrenaline

1779
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,403
which is keeping them safe from infection.

1780
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,910
After they get their heat
back on and they relax

1781
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,530
and they can finally warm up again,

1782
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,450
which we would like for them very soon,

1783
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:38,900
hopefully by the time
this podcast comes out,

1784
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,530
that will have already happened,

1785
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:42,530
that's typically when people get sick

1786
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:44,550
because the immune response is blunted

1787
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,023
as the stress response starts to subside.

1788
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:51,470
Stress, inflammation,
countering infection,

1789
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:52,700
that comes from endotoxin,

1790
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,190
that comes from any number of things.

1791
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,250
It can be from cold. It can
be from hyperventilation.

1792
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,080
It can be from a physical threat.

1793
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,720
It can be from the stress of
an exam or an upcoming surgery.

1794
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,030
This adrenaline thing

1795
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:07,180
and the inflammation
associated with it is adaptive.

1796
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,780
It's highly adaptive.

1797
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:10,830
It is a short-term plasticity

1798
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:12,660
that is designed to make us better

1799
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,890
for what we're experiencing
and challenged with, not worse,

1800
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:19,140
and so hopefully that will
add an additional layer

1801
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,160
to this whole idea that stress is bad,

1802
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,310
inflammation is bad, et cetera.

1803
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:26,510
Again, I'm not suggesting
people do or don't do

1804
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,530
something like Wim Hof, Tummo breathing,

1805
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,830
I just want to point to the utility.

1806
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,110
It's very similar to the
utility from cold showers,

1807
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,640
ice baths and other forms of anything

1808
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,540
that increase adrenaline.

1809
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,100
Every episode, I want to make sure

1810
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,690
that every listener comes away

1811
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,060
with as much knowledge as possible

1812
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,390
but also actionable tools,

1813
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,400
and today we've talked
about a variety of tools,

1814
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,160
but I want to center in on a
particular sequence of tools

1815
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,310
that hopefully you won't need,

1816
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:55,580
but presumably if you're a
human being and you're active,

1817
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,140
you will need at some point.

1818
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,870
It's about managing injury

1819
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,550
and recovering and healing fast

1820
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:04,363
or at least as fast as possible.

1821
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,370
It includes removing the pain.

1822
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,040
It includes getting mobility back

1823
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,400
and getting back to a normal life,

1824
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,170
whatever that means for you.

1825
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:17,380
I want to emphasize that what
I'm about to talk about next

1826
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,960
was developed in close
consultation with Kelly Starrett,

1827
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,200
who many of you probably
have heard of before.

1828
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,950
Kelly can be found at The Ready State.

1829
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,420
He's a formally trained,

1830
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,820
so degreed and educated,
exercise physiologist.

1831
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,370
He's a world expert in movement

1832
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:35,010
and tissue rehabilitation, et cetera.

1833
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,800
They're not sponsors of the podcast.

1834
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,550
Kelly is a friend and a colleague.

1835
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,270
He's somebody that I personally trust

1836
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:44,080
and his views on tissue
rehabilitation and injury

1837
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,960
I think are really grounded extremely well

1838
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,350
in both medicine, physiology,

1839
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,490
and the real cutting edge of what's new

1840
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:56,610
and what you might not
get in terms of advice

1841
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:58,160
from the typical person.

1842
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,700
All that said, you always,
always, always should consult

1843
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,500
with your physician before
adopting any protocols

1844
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,063
or removing any protocols.

1845
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,637
I asked Kelly, I made it
really simple, I said,

1846
01:16:08,637 --> 01:16:10,710
"Okay, let's say I were to sprain my ankle

1847
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,610
or break my arm or injure my knee

1848
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,853
or ACL tear or something
like that or shoulder injury,

1849
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,120
what are the absolute necessary things

1850
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,823
to do regardless of situation

1851
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:25,070
and what science is this grounded in?"

1852
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,630
And then I made it a point
to go find the studies

1853
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:32,070
that either supported or
refuted what he was telling me

1854
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:34,670
because that's why I'm here.

1855
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,440
The first one is a very basic one,

1856
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,700
that now you have a lot
of information to act on,

1857
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,110
which is in terms of

1858
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:43,940
what we know about tissue rehabilitation,

1859
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,420
both brain and body, we know
that sleep is essential,

1860
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,870
and so we both agreed
that eight hours minimum

1861
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:51,610
in bed per night is critical.

1862
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:52,810
What was interesting, however,

1863
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:55,970
is that it doesn't have to
be eight hours of sleep.

1864
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:58,240
We acknowledged that some of that time

1865
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,970
might be challenging to get to sleep,

1866
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:03,070
especially if one is in
pain or mobility is limited.

1867
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,280
We forget how often we roll over in bed

1868
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,060
or how the conditions of our sleeping

1869
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,853
can impact those injuries too.

1870
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,750
Kelly acknowledged, and I agree,

1871
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,030
that eight hours of sleep would be ideal,

1872
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,200
but if not, at least eight hours immobile

1873
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,420
and that speaks to the power of

1874
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,530
these non-sleep deep rest protocols too.

1875
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:23,620
If you can't sleep,

1876
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,370
doing non-sleep deep rest protocols,

1877
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,920
we've provided links to them before,

1878
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,530
we're going to continue to
provide links to the previous ones

1879
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:31,500
and new ones are coming soon,

1880
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,940
that is extremely beneficial.

1881
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,040
That's a non-negotiable

1882
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,170
in terms of getting the
foundation for allowing

1883
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:41,060
for glymphatic clearance and
tissue clearance, et cetera.

1884
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,850
The other is, if possible,

1885
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:46,350
unless it's absolutely excruciating
or you just can't do it,

1886
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,950
a 10-minute walk per day,

1887
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:50,030
of course you don't want
to exacerbate the injury,

1888
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:53,870
at least a 10-minute walk
per day and probably longer.

1889
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,080
This is where it gets interesting.

1890
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,640
I was taught, I learned that
when you injure yourself,

1891
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,950
you're supposed to ice something.

1892
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:01,230
You're supposed to put ice on
it, but I didn't realize this,

1893
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,980
but when speaking to
exercise physiologists

1894
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,170
and some physicians,

1895
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:08,990
they said that the ice is
really more of a placebo.

1896
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:12,100
It numbs the environment of the injury,

1897
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,140
which is not surprising,

1898
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,020
and will eliminate the
pain for a short while,

1899
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,390
but it has some negative effects

1900
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,020
that perhaps offset its use.

1901
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,570
One, it sludges,

1902
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:24,440
it creates sludging within the blood

1903
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,840
and other lymphatic tissue,

1904
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,440
so it actually can create
some clotting and sludging

1905
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,060
of the tissue and fluids,

1906
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:34,320
the fascial interface with muscle,

1907
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,240
and a number of the stuff

1908
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,720
that's supposed to be
flowing through there

1909
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,690
can slow up and increase
inflammation in the wrong way,

1910
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:44,980
can actually restrict movement
out of the injury site,

1911
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:47,770
which is bad because
you want the macrophages

1912
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:51,060
and the other cell types
phagocytosing, eating up,

1913
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,050
the debris in an injury

1914
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:55,643
and moving it out of there
so that it can repair.

1915
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,587
That was surprising to
me which made me ask,

1916
01:18:58,587 --> 01:18:59,710
"Well, then what about heat?"

1917
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:03,070
Well, it turns out heat is
actually quite beneficial.

1918
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:04,870
A lot of people talk
about heat shock proteins

1919
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:07,740
and all these genetic
pathways and protein pathways

1920
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,240
that can be activated by heat.

1921
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,050
Very little data to support the idea

1922
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,480
that heat shock proteins

1923
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,860
are part of the wound healing process,

1924
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,930
at least in terms of the
sorts of conventional heat

1925
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:22,420
that one could use like a hot water bottle

1926
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:25,560
or a hot bath or a hot compress.

1927
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,680
The major effects seem to be explained

1928
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,270
by heat improving the
viscosity of the tissues

1929
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:35,420
and the clearance and
the perfusion of fluid,

1930
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,180
blood, lymph and other fluids,

1931
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,960
out of the injury area.

1932
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,480
That's really interesting.
I didn't know this.

1933
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,020
I thought, well, you're
supposed to ice something.

1934
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,680
I said, well, whenever I would see

1935
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,578
a kid get injured in soccer,

1936
01:19:45,578 --> 01:19:46,810
never me, of course,

1937
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,900
no, of course I got injured
in soccer from time to time,

1938
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,980
they give you an ice pack

1939
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,330
and the ice pack removes some of the pain.

1940
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:55,540
I think the consensus now,
which was surprising to me,

1941
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,080
is that the ice pack is actually

1942
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,810
more of the top-down modulation.

1943
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:01,410
You think you're doing
something for the pain

1944
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,820
and there's some interesting studies

1945
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:05,030
that actually showed the
placebo effect of the ice pack,

1946
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,570
so ice packs are placebo, perhaps.

1947
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:08,403
That's interesting.

1948
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,110
I'll underline perhaps because who knows?

1949
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,440
Maybe there's some people out
there that are going to say

1950
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,750
this is totally crazy

1951
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,387
and the ice is actually very beneficial,

1952
01:20:15,387 --> 01:20:18,120
but it seems like heat, mobility,

1953
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,870
sleep, keeping movement,

1954
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,890
and it turns out that the movement itself

1955
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,930
can act as a bit of an analgesic,

1956
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,760
it can actually reduce the pain,

1957
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,800
whereas the ice reduces the
pain but sludges the tissue

1958
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,430
and keeps the cells
that need to be removed

1959
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:35,880
from leaving the area.

1960
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,630
What's also interesting
is in neuroscience we know

1961
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,570
that if we want to kill
neurons or silence neurons,

1962
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,970
we cool them.

1963
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:46,540
This is a well-known
tool in the laboratory.

1964
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:50,420
Some of the early and most
important studies in neuroscience

1965
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,170
that formed the basis for the textbooks

1966
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:53,790
were lowering a cooling probe

1967
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:56,070
into a particular area of the
brain or a peripheral nerve

1968
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:57,730
in order to shut down that nerve,

1969
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:00,080
so the cooling will shut down the nerve,

1970
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:04,800
but another very well-known
fact in neuroscience text books

1971
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,340
is that when the activity
of the nerve pathway

1972
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,890
or neurons comes back,

1973
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,190
there's what's called
homeostatic plasticity,

1974
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:13,500
that it rebounds with greater pain,

1975
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,980
with a higher level of intensity,

1976
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,310
which in the pain system
would equate to greater pain.

1977
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,710
Regardless of where these
neurons are in the body,

1978
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,060
if you stimulate a neuron, it's active.

1979
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,050
If you cool it, it becomes inactive

1980
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:27,110
and when the neuron heats
back up after being cooled,

1981
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:28,950
it becomes hyperactive,

1982
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:32,440
and so this makes really
good sense as to why heat,

1983
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,560
provided it's not damaging levels of heat,

1984
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,520
would be more beneficial for wound healing

1985
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,490
and for reducing pain in
the short and long run

1986
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:43,930
than would be cold or ice,

1987
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,770
which I find very interesting.

1988
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,253
In terms of chronic pain,

1989
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,510
the manuscripts on this,

1990
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:52,270
my discussion with Kelly and with others,

1991
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:54,560
point to the fact that
chronic pain is basically

1992
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,150
plasticity gone wrong.

1993
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:59,077
It's sort of like PTSD
for the emotional system

1994
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:00,510
and the stress system,

1995
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:02,950
and chronic pain is going to involve

1996
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,550
a number of different protocols

1997
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:07,380
to rewire both the brain centers

1998
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,650
and the peripheral centers
associated with chronic pain.

1999
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,850
Certain things like
fibromyalgia, for instance,

2000
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,730
which is whole-body pain,

2001
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:16,470
relate to too little inhibition.

2002
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,490
In the brain, you have
excitation and inhibition.

2003
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:19,890
They come from different
sources of neurons.

2004
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:23,010
The inhibition is mainly from GABA

2005
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:25,503
and glycine and things like that.

2006
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,650
In fibromyalgia, there's
too little central,

2007
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:30,723
within the brain,

2008
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,790
modulation of the pain responses

2009
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,330
so that people experience whole-body pain.

2010
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,100
In that case, the emerging
therapies are really interesting.

2011
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,250
I have a friend who works

2012
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,490
for the National Institutes of Health

2013
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:44,130
who unfortunately
suffers from fibromyalgia

2014
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,440
who asked me about this a lot

2015
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,910
and his question and what
he's now actually exploring

2016
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,300
is red light therapy.

2017
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,400
Something that I've talked about
on various Instagram posts.

2018
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,120
Red light therapy
typically is talked about

2019
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,990
in terms of mitochondria

2020
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:59,600
and the data on that are not so terrific,

2021
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,150
at least not really published

2022
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:03,070
in blue ribbon journals in most cases,

2023
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:04,950
except for one study that I'm aware of

2024
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:07,570
from Glen Jeffery's lab at
University College London

2025
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,710
showing that red light
stimulation to the eyes

2026
01:23:09,710 --> 01:23:11,550
in people 40 or older

2027
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:13,870
can offset some of the effects
of macular degeneration

2028
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,620
by improving the health
of the photo receptors.

2029
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,850
People with fibromyalgia,
which is this whole-body pain,

2030
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:23,070
are now starting to use
red light therapies.

2031
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:27,007
When I asked Kelly and others
and some experts in pain,

2032
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:29,530
"What are your thoughts
on this red light therapy

2033
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:32,230
for things like fibromyalgia and pain,

2034
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,860
especially red light local therapy?"

2035
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:38,530
Their idea, and I don't
think this is a field

2036
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:39,860
that's progressed far enough now

2037
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,450
to really place any firm conclusions on,

2038
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:45,820
but the idea is that red
light therapy locally

2039
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,350
may have some effect,

2040
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,320
but the systemic red light therapy,

2041
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:52,880
this is like wearing protection
to the eyes, in some cases,

2042
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,140
so not for the treatment
of macular degeneration

2043
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:56,460
but wearing protection of the eyes

2044
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,540
and getting very bright red light therapy

2045
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,447
in many ways may be, and
to use Kelly's words,

2046
01:24:02,447 --> 01:24:04,360
"Approximating the effects of nature."

2047
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,100
These are like surrogate technologies

2048
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,740
for getting outside in the sunshine.

2049
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,450
When you're in the sun,
it might not look red,

2050
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:12,610
but there are a lot of red
wavelengths coming toward you.

2051
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,920
The red light therapies
may have some utility,

2052
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,090
but getting into sunlight
may actually have

2053
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:20,010
as much or more effect.

2054
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,890
Of course, if these wounds
are on a part of the body

2055
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,330
that you can't expose,

2056
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,430
then you could imagine why

2057
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:25,930
the red light therapy might be good.

2058
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,363
I don't know, depending on
the neighborhood you live in,

2059
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,500
that may or may not be a
weird thing to go outside

2060
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,150
and expose your body to sunlight.

2061
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,810
Probably a number of factors that dictate

2062
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:34,960
whether or not that'd be weird or not,

2063
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,690
but that's up to you, not me,

2064
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,670
and it seems that,

2065
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:42,320
so movement, heat, not ice,

2066
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,740
light, sleep,

2067
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:47,610
and in some cases, the use,

2068
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:48,820
and I'll talk about this in a moment,

2069
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:51,050
that some cases the use of restricting

2070
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:53,420
above and below the injury to then release

2071
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:56,340
and then increase
perfusion through the site

2072
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,800
may actually accelerate the wound healing.

2073
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,010
All of this might sound just
like common sense knowledge,

2074
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,710
but to me, at least as a 45-year-old,

2075
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,180
I always just thought it's ice,

2076
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,730
it's non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs,

2077
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:10,840
it's things that block prostaglandins,

2078
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,310
so things like aspirin,
ibuprofen, acetaminophen.

2079
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,270
Those things generally
work by blocking things,

2080
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:21,530
they're called the COX
prostaglandin blockers

2081
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,163
and things of that sort,
things in that pathway.

2082
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:28,460
Those sorts of treatments
which reduce inflammation

2083
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,900
may not be so great at the beginning

2084
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,400
when you want inflammation,

2085
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,480
they may be important for limiting pain

2086
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,430
so people can be functional at all,

2087
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,690
but the things that I talked about today

2088
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:41,190
really are anchored in three principles.

2089
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:44,980
One is that the inflammation
response is a good one.

2090
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,500
This is what we're learning
from Qiufu Ma's lab's

2091
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,850
work on acupuncture.

2092
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:51,150
The immediate acute
inflammation response is good.

2093
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,930
It calls to the site of injury

2094
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:56,730
things that are going to clean
up the injury and bad cells.

2095
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:58,910
Then there are going to be things

2096
01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:00,510
that are going to improve perfusion,

2097
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:03,780
like the glymphatic
system, getting deep sleep,

2098
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,083
feet elevated, sleeping on one side,

2099
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:11,100
low-level Zone 2 cardio
three times a week.

2100
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,200
Red light, perhaps, is going to be useful

2101
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,430
although sunlight might be just as good

2102
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:17,680
depending on who you talk to,

2103
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,460
and we can talk about that
probably more at length

2104
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,660
in a future episode.

2105
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:24,620
A number of people will ask
me, I'm sure, about stem cells

2106
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:27,540
and I don't want to take more of your time

2107
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:29,960
by going into an hour-long
discussion about stem cells.

2108
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:31,850
Stem cells exist in all
of us during development.

2109
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,850
We were created from stem cells,

2110
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:36,460
which are cells that can
become essentially anything.

2111
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:39,210
Later, cells get what's called
restricted in their lineage,

2112
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,280
so a skin cell,

2113
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:44,240
unless you do some fancy
molecular gymnastics to it,

2114
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,903
you can't actually turn
that cell into a neuron.

2115
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,090
Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize

2116
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:51,140
for finding these Yamanaka factors

2117
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,080
which you could give a skin
cell to turn into a neuron,

2118
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,580
but that's not an approved
therapy at this time,

2119
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:59,250
but many people ask me
about platelet-rich plasma,

2120
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:00,900
so-called PRP.

2121
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,180
They take blood, they
enrich for platelets,

2122
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,340
and they re-inject it back into people.

2123
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,790
Here's the deal. This
deserves an entire episode.

2124
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:13,530
It has never been shown whether
or not the injection itself

2125
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:16,180
is what's actually creating the effect.

2126
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:17,950
This is something that
the acupuncture literature

2127
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:19,470
suffered from for a long time,

2128
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:22,070
that the sham control, as it's called,

2129
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,390
sham, we don't mean it's a sham,

2130
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:25,030
but in science you say a sham control

2131
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:28,700
meaning you do everything
exactly the same way you would.

2132
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,180
So for acupuncture,

2133
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:33,410
you would bring the needle
right up to the skin,

2134
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:34,560
but you wouldn't actually poke it

2135
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,070
into the skin, for instance.

2136
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:37,990
That would be a sham control.

2137
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,940
With a drug treatment,

2138
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:41,880
you would inject a drug into a person

2139
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,670
and then the control, the sham control,

2140
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,630
would be that you would
bring the injection over,

2141
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:47,810
you might do the injection
or not do the injection

2142
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:49,380
'cause you imagine that
the injection itself

2143
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:50,610
could have an effect.

2144
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:52,660
It's never really been
shown whether or not PRP

2145
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,950
has effects that are separate

2146
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:57,010
from injecting a volume
of fluid into a tissue.

2147
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:00,060
The claims that PRP
actually contains stem cells

2148
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,990
are very, very feeble,

2149
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:04,928
and when you look at the literature

2150
01:28:04,928 --> 01:28:08,340
and you talk to anyone expert
in the stem cell field,

2151
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:10,610
they will tell you that it's,

2152
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:14,280
the number of stem cells in
PRP is infinitesimally small.

2153
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,230
In fact, so much so that these places

2154
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:21,630
that inject PRP for injuries
are not allowed to advertise

2155
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,480
through the use of the words stem cells.

2156
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:24,990
It's actually illegal at this point,

2157
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:26,150
at least as far as I know.

2158
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:28,300
It was through the end of last year

2159
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,620
and I'm guessing it still is now.

2160
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:32,970
Stem cells are an exciting
area of technology.

2161
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,980
However, there's a clinic down in Florida

2162
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,880
that was shut down a couple of years ago

2163
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,350
for injecting stem cells
harvested from patients

2164
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,130
into the eye for macular degeneration.

2165
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:46,490
These were people that were
suffering from poor vision

2166
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,687
and very shortly after injecting

2167
01:28:48,687 --> 01:28:50,060
the stem cells into the eyes,

2168
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,270
they went completely blind.

2169
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:56,280
I'm somebody who is very skeptical

2170
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,760
of the stem cell treatment
work that's out there.

2171
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,010
It's actually very hard to get

2172
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:02,580
in the United States for this reason.

2173
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:06,350
It's not approved. The PRP
treatments are very complicated.

2174
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:08,080
The marketing around them is

2175
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:11,550
shaky at best.

2176
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,080
I'm sure a number of people
will say that they had PRP

2177
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,100
and benefited from it tremendously
and I don't doubt that.

2178
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,380
Whether or not it was placebo,

2179
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,290
today we talked a lot
about top-down control,

2180
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:24,270
that's just a variant on the
word placebo, belief effects,

2181
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:27,000
whether or not it was
placebo or not, I don't know.

2182
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,740
I wasn't there.

2183
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:31,030
That's for you to decide
and I'm not here to tell you

2184
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:32,350
that you should or shouldn't do something,

2185
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:34,840
but I do think that anything
involving stem cells,

2186
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,360
one should be very cautious of.

2187
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,290
You should also be very cautious
of anyone that tells you

2188
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:41,050
that PRP is injecting a lot of stem cells.

2189
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:43,410
This is an evolving area that really needs

2190
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,460
a lot more work and attention.

2191
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:49,190
The major issue with stem cells
that I think is concerning

2192
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:52,240
is that stem cells are cells

2193
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,270
that want to become lots
of different things,

2194
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:56,150
not just the tissue that
you're interested in.

2195
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:57,030
If you damage your knee

2196
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:00,100
and you inject stem cells into your knee,

2197
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,730
you need to molecularly
restrict those stem cells

2198
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,733
so that they don't become tumor cells.

2199
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,680
A tumor is a collection of stem cells.

2200
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,300
When you get something horrible

2201
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,940
like glioblastoma in the brain,

2202
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,280
which is a terrible thing to have,

2203
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,100
it's glial cells that returned

2204
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,150
to stemness, excessive stemness,

2205
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:21,610
they've started to produce
too many of themselves,

2206
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:25,460
and glioblastoma is
often deadly, not always.

2207
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,460
Injecting stem cells, it sounds great,

2208
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,990
and it sounds like something
that one would want to do,

2209
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:33,160
but one needs to approach
this with extreme caution,

2210
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,390
even if it's your own blood

2211
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,480
or stem cells that you're re-injecting.

2212
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,483
I think those technologies are
coming. They're on the way.

2213
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,980
If any of you are devotees of PRP,

2214
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:46,530
tell me your experiences with them.

2215
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,250
I'm curious. I want to see the papers.

2216
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,250
I want to know the evidence,

2217
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,357
and of course, there are always
folks out there that say,

2218
01:30:51,357 --> 01:30:52,860
"I don't care what the scientists

2219
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,550
and the physicians and the FDA say.

2220
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:56,840
I just want to do this,"

2221
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,700
and if that's your stance,
that's your stance.

2222
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,400
I'm not here to govern that,

2223
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,520
but I do think that
people should be informed,

2224
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,720
and in thinking about
tissue recovery and injury,

2225
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,330
that's what I was able to glean.

2226
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:10,110
Again, check out what Kelly

2227
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:13,120
and his coworkers are
doing at The Ready State.

2228
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:16,120
It's phenomenal and they've
worked with all the top people

2229
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,670
in just about every
domain of life, it seems.

2230
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:20,143
Very high-integrity folks.

2231
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,550
Some of you are probably
saying, "Well, I'm not injured.

2232
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:25,660
I'm not an athlete. I don't
want stem cell injections.

2233
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:26,493
I don't have," again,

2234
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:29,630
I'm saying you shouldn't get
stem cell injections for now.

2235
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:31,670
Please hold off until
the field learns more

2236
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,230
about how to do that safely,

2237
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:35,087
but I want to talk about

2238
01:31:35,087 --> 01:31:38,110
and end with a really interesting

2239
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:40,380
and somewhat weird technology,

2240
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:43,180
which is baby blood.

2241
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,570
I have a colleague at Stanford,

2242
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:46,800
his name is Tony Wyss-Coray,

2243
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,330
and in 2014 his laboratory
published a study

2244
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:54,640
showing that the blood of young rodents,

2245
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,070
mice and rats,

2246
01:31:56,070 --> 01:32:00,300
when transfused into
old, demented rodents,

2247
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,870
mice and rats,

2248
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:04,230
made those old, demented rodents

2249
01:32:04,230 --> 01:32:09,160
recover much of their
memory and seem much more

2250
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,103
vital and energetic,

2251
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:16,200
better recall of different
spatial learning tasks.

2252
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,410
Tissue and wound healing,
they've since shown,

2253
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:22,130
can be improved in these older animals.

2254
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:23,280
It's pretty incredible.

2255
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:26,410
They went on to show several years later

2256
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:30,550
that blood from umbilical cords,

2257
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,450
I'm not making this up,

2258
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:35,320
blood from umbilical cords can do the same

2259
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,800
and this is the basis
of a biotech company.

2260
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,480
Actually, one of my former postdocs

2261
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,850
is now an employee there.

2262
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:46,240
They've isolated the
molecules from young blood

2263
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,910
that seems to vitalize

2264
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:52,900
or revitalize the old brain and body,

2265
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,550
and one of those molecules
goes by the name TIMP2.

2266
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:56,983
T-I-M-P-2.

2267
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,890
Where's all this going?

2268
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:03,030
Well, I don't know how
long it's going to be

2269
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:05,860
before there are treatments based on

2270
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,930
these blood transfusions.

2271
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:11,430
I doubt that blood transfusions themselves

2272
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:13,740
from young people into old people

2273
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,780
is going to be used for
the treatment of dementia,

2274
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:19,910
although it might, as weird as it seems.

2275
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:22,730
We know that transfusions
of all sorts of stuff,

2276
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,420
for instance, fecal transplants

2277
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:25,780
are being used to treat obesity.

2278
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:30,310
The gut microbiome of
thin people is being,

2279
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,020
not transfused, but is being transplanted

2280
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:36,140
into the colons and guts of obese people

2281
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,480
and leading to weight loss,

2282
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,440
which sounds really wild

2283
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,610
and is not a topic I
particularly enjoy talking about,

2284
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:45,810
but nonetheless, it
points to the importance

2285
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:47,900
of the gut microbiome in regulating things

2286
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:50,210
like blood sugar and health

2287
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:52,720
as it relates to obesity and diabetes

2288
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,423
and all sorts of things.

2289
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:57,340
It does appear that there are things,

2290
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:00,560
factors in the blood of young members

2291
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,790
of a given species that are lost over time

2292
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:06,920
in the older members of that species.

2293
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,340
I'm not going to give you a tool

2294
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,210
on the basis of these findings today.

2295
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:14,740
I am not going to tell
you to consume any fluid

2296
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:17,493
from any other member of your species,

2297
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:21,510
our species, for any reason,

2298
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:23,730
but I do think that it's
important to mention

2299
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:27,450
that the science is asking questions

2300
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:31,620
such as what are the
factors within the brain

2301
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,900
that allow the young brain
to recover so much better

2302
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,030
than the older brain from injury,

2303
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:40,990
from all sorts of things,
events, et cetera,

2304
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:43,790
and what are the factors
in the older brain

2305
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:45,200
that are limiting,

2306
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:49,080
and thinking about
identifying which factors

2307
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:53,590
are going to allow people to
restore cognitive function,

2308
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:56,350
physical function, wound
healing and so forth.

2309
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,750
It's a really exciting area.

2310
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,200
I mention it not to be sensationalist

2311
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,260
but because it's happening

2312
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,700
and because there's a lot
of excitement about it

2313
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,700
and because I think it's clear

2314
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,050
that the young brain and body and blood

2315
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:16,290
are very different from the
old brain, body and blood,

2316
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:18,910
and the goal of science is to identify

2317
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:22,083
and isolate those factors
that make that so,

2318
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:27,060
such that people who would
otherwise get dementia

2319
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:29,910
or perhaps even have dementia
will be allowed to recover.

2320
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:34,370
Again, not an actionable
item at this point,

2321
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:38,630
but one to think about,
perhaps not too long,

2322
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:39,993
but one to think about.

2323
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:42,260
I'm going to close there.

2324
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:45,020
I've talked about a lot of tools today.

2325
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:48,140
I've talked a lot about somatosensation,

2326
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,780
about plasticity, about
pain, about acupuncture,

2327
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:55,840
some of the nuance of acupuncture,
inflammation and stress.

2328
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,240
We even talked a little bit
about high-intensity breathing,

2329
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,740
talked about restricting limb movement

2330
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:05,610
to get compensatory regrowth of pathways,

2331
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:08,090
or I should say reactivation of pathways

2332
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:09,970
that have been injured or damaged.

2333
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:10,970
As always,

2334
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:15,950
we take a whirlwind tour
through a given topic,

2335
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:18,220
lay down some tools as we go.

2336
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,410
Hopefully the principles that
relate to pain and injury

2337
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:24,700
but also neuroplasticity in general,

2338
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,910
today in the context of
the somatosensory system,

2339
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:28,310
will be of use to all of you.

2340
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:31,070
I don't wish injury on any of you,

2341
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:34,620
but I do hope that you'll
take this information to mind

2342
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,820
and that you will think about it

2343
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:38,330
if ever you find yourself in a situation

2344
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:39,630
where you have to ask

2345
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,840
what's the difference
between my perception

2346
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,040
and the actual tissue damage?

2347
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,010
Is injury and pain, is it the same?

2348
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:45,940
Well, no.

2349
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:48,700
Do I have some control
over my experience of pain?

2350
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,910
Absolutely.

2351
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:51,810
Does all of that involve taking drugs

2352
01:36:51,810 --> 01:36:53,140
or doing certain therapeutics?

2353
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,250
No, not necessarily.

2354
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,920
There's the incredible
subjective component.

2355
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,300
There also is a need sometimes

2356
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:03,400
to treat the injury at the
level of the pain receptors

2357
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,220
at the site of the wound,

2358
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:09,450
so please take the information,
do with it what you will,

2359
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,070
and in the meantime,

2360
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:13,400
thank you so much for
your time and attention.

2361
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,470
