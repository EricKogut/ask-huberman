1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,290
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,640
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,953
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,910
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,080
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,530
Today, we continue in our
discussion about sensation

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,370
or how we sense things.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,920
On previous episodes, we
talked about sensing light

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,620
and sound waves for things
like vision and hearing.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,290
Today, we are going to
talk about our sense

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,453
of self or what's called interoception.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,360
Interoception is our sensing

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,870
of our internal landscape,
things like our heartbeat,

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,580
our breathing, and our gut,
how full our gut might happen

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,200
to be, or how empty our
gut might happen to be.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,630
But also our inner landscape
with respect to chemistry,

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,630
how acidic, or how good or
bad we feel on the inside.

18
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,240
This discussion about sense

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,010
of self and interoception
has many important,

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,340
actionable items that relate

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,960
to bodily health and brain health,

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,253
and believe it or not,

23
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:07,530
our ability to perform well
or perform poorly in life.

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,810
Indeed, it has profound influence
on our rates of healing.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,980
So today we are going to talk
about all the aspects of our

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,030
inner landscape and how our
brain and body communicate.

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,360
And there will be many
actionable protocols

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,240
as we go along that discussion.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,770
Before we begin our discussion
about sense of self,

30
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,290
I want to highlight some very
recently published research

31
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,800
findings that I believe
are immediately actionable

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,000
and that everybody should be aware of.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,860
These are data that were
published by my colleague,

34
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,470
Justin Sonnenberg's laboratory

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,490
at Stanford University School of Medicine,

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,920
and the data were published
in the Journal Cell,

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,660
which is a very high
stringency cell press journal.

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,700
So phenomenal data.

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,360
What this study showed was
that individuals given a high

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,550
fiber diet actually
experienced less diversity

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,870
of what's called the gut microbiome.

42
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,670
The number of positive or
health promoting bacteria

43
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,090
in the gut was actually
reduced by a high fiber diet,

44
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,910
whereas individuals that ate just a couple

45
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,400
of servings of fermented food each day,

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,400
experience important
and beneficial increases

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,300
in anti-inflammatory markers.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,830
And that could be traced
back to improvements

49
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,470
in the gut microbiome
diversity, the diversity

50
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,550
of bugs, literally little bacteria

51
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,405
that live in the gut,
which might sound bad,

52
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:28,290
but they are actually
very health promoting.

53
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,210
I'm going to get into all
the details of this study

54
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,540
later in the episode,

55
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,690
but I just wanted to
emphasize these findings

56
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,680
because they are immediately actionable.

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,880
I think for most people
ingesting one or two servings

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,010
of fermented food each day is
reasonable and does not bring

59
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,500
with it tremendous costs or
tremendous inconvenience.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,340
And I think many people are
ingesting high fiber diets

61
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,940
thinking that that's the best way

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,000
to improve their gut microbiome.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,300
So while these data may prove
to be controversial among the

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,680
folks out there in the
nutrition community,

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,790
that really high fiber diet,

66
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,380
I want to just emphasize that
these data were looked at

67
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,780
in a very unbiased way.

68
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,020
They were done with large scale screens

69
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,160
of all sorts of inflammatory markers.

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,290
There was no specific hypothesis going in.

71
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,330
It was purely exploratory,
but the data are very clear.

72
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,270
It doesn't mean you shouldn't
eat fiber doesn't mean

73
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,450
that fiber is bad,

74
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,550
but it really shows that
eating fermented foods,

75
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,210
just one or two servings a day,

76
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,010
and maybe even ramping up to
three or four servings per day

77
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,010
can be very beneficial for
many aspects of health.

78
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,240
Before we go any further.

79
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,610
I'd like to emphasize that this
podcast is separate from my

80
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,410
teaching and research roles
at Stanford, it is however,

81
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,530
part of my desire and effort
to bring zero cost to consumer

82
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,290
information about science
and science related tools

83
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,810
to the general public.

84
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,900
In keeping with that theme,

85
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,790
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

86
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,760
Our first sponsor is Roka.

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
Rocha makes sunglasses

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,460
and eyeglasses that are of the
absolutely highest quality.

89
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,700
The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers

90
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,020
from Stanford and everything
about their sunglasses

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,780
and eyeglasses is developed
with performance in mind.

92
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
I've spent my career
working on the visual system

93
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,620
and its various functionings

94
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,575
within the brain and within the eye,

95
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:10,010
Roka sunglasses and
eyeglasses are so phenomenal

96
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,870
because they allow the visual system

97
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,150
to do what it does best,

98
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,089
which is to adjust to changes
in what we call luminance

99
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,829
or brightness, with many
sunglasses out there

100
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,219
and with many eyeglasses as well,

101
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,480
if the brightness in the room changes

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,700
or you get cloud cover, or you walk

103
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,110
into a shadow, you have to
take the glasses on or off,

104
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,600
you can't see as well.

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,170
But the folks at Roka really understand

106
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,325
how the visual system works.

107
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:35,020
And so they've designed their sunglasses

108
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,790
and eyeglasses such that you
never experienced that shift.

109
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,990
You can walk into a shadow.

110
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,340
The amount of sunlight can change.

111
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,190
You can go into a dark room, et cetera,

112
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,670
provided there's enough
light to see you're going

113
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,220
to see everything crystal clear.

114
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,760
In addition you see
everything crystal clear

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,040
because the lens quality is terrific

116
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,330
and the sunglasses and
eyeglasses are very lightweight.

117
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,680
So you don't even notice
that they're on your face.

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,500
Also the sunglasses and eyeglasses

119
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,950
are designed for performance.

120
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,460
You can use them while
running or while cycling.

121
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,350
Even if you sweat, they
won't slip off your face.

122
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,880
And as I mentioned before,
they're very lightweight.

123
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,820
So everything about
these glasses is terrific

124
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,890
and they have a terrific aesthetic.

125
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,800
They have a lot of different
styles to select from.

126
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
And unlike a lot of performance
eyeglasses out there,

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,180
they won't make you look like a cyborg.

128
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,940
You could wear them to
dinner or to somebody's home.

129
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,180
And they look really nice.

130
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,650
If you'd like to try Roka glasses,

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.

135
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,080
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,710
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

137
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,050
to help you better meet your health goals.

138
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,740
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done for

139
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,030
the simple reason that many of
the factors that impact your

140
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,720
immediate and long-term
health can only be assessed,

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,470
can only be measured from
a quality blood test.

142
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,080
And now with the advent
of quality DNA tests,

143
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,310
you can get further insight

144
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,430
into the status of your
immediate and long term health.

145
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,590
One of the problems with a
lot of blood and DNA tests

146
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,130
that are out there, however,
is you get the numbers back,

147
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,250
you get the levels of
metabolic factors, hormones,

148
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,650
et cetera, but you don't
get any information about

149
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,450
what to do with those numbers
or how to actually shift them

150
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,150
in the direction that you want to.

151
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,956
With Inside Tracker, they have

152
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,470
this very easy to use dashboard

153
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,400
and that dashboard makes
it very clear, not just

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
what your levels of
hormones, et cetera are,

155
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:24,470
but what actions to take in
terms of nutrition or exercise

156
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,840
or other lifestyle factors
to bring those numbers

157
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,260
into the appropriate ranges for you.

158
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,700

165
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:48,980
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.

166
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,510
Headspace is a meditation app

167
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,570
that's backed by 25 peer
reviewed published studies

168
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,870
and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

169
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,390
I started meditating
when I was in my teens,

170
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,040
but for many years I found it
hard to maintain a meditation

171
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,920
practice, I don't think
I'm alone with that.

172
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,860
I think many people start meditating.

173
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,500
They'll do it for a few
weeks or a few months,

174
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,820
or maybe even a year.

175
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,810
And then they'll give up
the meditation practice.

176
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,400
And we know from so many
peer reviewed studies that

177
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,040
meditation has a number of
very positive effects on our

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,830
brain health, our ability to
focus and our bodily health.

179
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,840
So it's a great thing, we
probably should all be doing it,

180
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,730
but most of us, including myself,

181
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,690
have found it hard to stick
to a meditation practice.

182
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,370
Then I started using the Headspace
app and what I found is I

183
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,970
could be very consistent
with my meditation practice

184
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,140
because they have
meditations that are short,

185
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,973
meditation that are medium length,

186
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:38,580
and meditations that are a bit longer,

187
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,540
all of which benefit me.

188
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,120
The meditations that they have
also are of different styles.

189
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,410
You can try different forms of meditation.

190
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,860
I particularly like having
a guide for my meditation.

191
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,120
It just helps me stay focused,

192
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,820
helps me stay on track and
I'm able to derive all those

193
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,060
regular benefits of meditation
and keep the practice up

194
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,750
on a regular basis, if
you want to try Headspace,

195
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,760
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

196
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,435
And if you do that,

197
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:04,130
you'll get a one month totally free trial.

198
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,830
And with that, you'll get all

199
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,400
of Headspace's meditations, the
full library of meditations.

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,460
You just go to
headspace.com/special offer,

201
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,280
and you get all of their
meditations for one free month

202
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,360
and you get to try it, if you
don't like it, you can stop.

203
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,710
But I think you will enjoy it.

204
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,980
I certainly enjoy meditation

205
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,910
and we know that it's very
beneficial for all of us.

206
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,930
If you're somebody who cares

207
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,000
about your immediate and long-term health,

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,400
and if you're somebody who's
interested in performance

209
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,160
of any kind in work in
relationships, et cetera,

210
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,450
today's topic I believe

211
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,513
is among the more important ones for you.

212
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,940
Of all the topics I could cover,

213
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,419
this thing that we call sense of self,

214
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,149
which is also called
interoception has perhaps the most

215
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,160
foundational level of
importance for all that.

216
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,450
We feel all that we do and all
that we are capable of doing.

217
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,120
In fact I will go so far as to say

218
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,170
that interoception or our ability

219
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,510
to sense our inner real estate
is right there next to sleep.

220
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,780
And perhaps one other feature
of our health and bodily

221
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,060
function that primary early
determine how good we feel

222
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,890
in the now in the short
term, and in the longterm,

223
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,720
and sets the stage for everything
we are capable of doing.

224
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,450
And if we don't take care of this thing

225
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,460
that we call interoception,

226
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,580
just like if we don't take care of sleep,

227
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,973
we cannot perform well and
we will not remain healthy.

228
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,010
Interoception and sense of
self are essentially the same

229
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,730
thing, I will use those
terms interchangeably,

230
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,730
at least for sake of today's discussion.

231
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,920
And I promise that if you
can learn a little bit

232
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,980
about the mechanisms of self sensing,

233
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,170
of understanding what's going
on in your internal milieu,

234
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,580
as we say your internal environment,

235
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,060
you will position yourself
to do some very simple things

236
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,320
that can lead to outsize positive effects

237
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,450
on everything from sleep
to body composition,

238
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,820
to mental focus, to mood, your
ability to regulate stress,

239
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,350
and indeed even your ability
to heal and recovery from

240
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,400
injuries of different kinds,
brain injury and bodily injury.

241
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,440
So sense of self is absolutely crucial.

242
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,060
It's sometimes called our sixth sense,

243
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,450
right alongside the other five
senses like hearing vision,

244
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,000
touch, taste, smell, et cetera,

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,340
but sense of self is different.

246
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,570
Sense of self is really about what's going

247
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,440
on internally within the
confines of our skin.

248
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,920
And it involves two key features
that if you can understand

249
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,700
those features, and you
understand what modulates

250
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,950
or changes, our ability
to sense those features,

251
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,620
there are a lot of things that you can do

252
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,920
in terms of how you structure
your nutritional practices,

253
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,950
how you relate to your exercise practices,

254
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,330
perhaps even certain things
that you take in terms

255
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,820
of supplementation that can
basically make you feel better,

256
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,040
more alert, and more
capable for everything.

257
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,730
I don't think that's a
hyperbolic statement, I, in fact,

258
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,520
I know it's not a hyperbolic
statement because we have a

259
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,500
system in our body that connects our brain

260
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,530
to all of our bodily organs

261
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,190
and connects all of those
bodily organs to our brain.

262
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,730
And that communication
between brain and body

263
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,540
in both directions creates a situation

264
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,470
where either we are
positioned to do things well,

265
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,850
or we are positioned to do things poorly.

266
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,010
So I really want to dive in and dissect,

267
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,290
what is this system of
brain, body communication?

268
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,123
What does it look like?

269
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,060
What are the actual
neurons and connections?

270
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,700
And as I do that,

271
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,900
I promise that I'm going
to place protocols,

272
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,260
tools that you can apply
in order to make sure

273
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,760
that those neurons and
connections are working optimally.

274
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,750
So let's begin by talking about
what system communicates the

275
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,383
brain to the body and the
body back to the brain.

276
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,250
The system that's most often
associated with this is our

277
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,540
10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.

278
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,730
The word vagus relates
to the word vagabond,

279
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,530
which to wander, and indeed
the vagus nerve is a vast,

280
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,810
enormous wandering set of
nerves, so it's not one nerve.

281
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,820
It's not like one fiber, one axon.

282
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,170
As we say in the nervous
system, we have these wires,

283
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,560
we call axons that let
neurons communicate.

284
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,270
It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch

285
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,550
of wires that go everywhere,
so where do they go?

286
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,493
Well they leave the
brain, and the brain stem,

287
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:17,430
the brain stem is kind of
the back of your brain.

288
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,550
If you touch the back of your neck,

289
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,070
it's about three inches deep
to where you're touching.

290
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,090
The neurons that are there

291
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,210
send information into the body

292
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,430
to control your bodily organs,
how fast your heart is,

293
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,700
beating how fast you're breathing,

294
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,070
how fast your digestion is occurring.

295
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,930
Even things like whether
or not you are going

296
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,470
to secrete so-called killer cells,

297
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,960
your immune cells from your
spleen to go ward off bacteria.

298
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,100
Now the neurons there don't
know what to do unless they

299
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,170
receive information about
what's going on within the body

300
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,200
and within the body, your heart,
your lungs, your diaphragm,

301
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,610
your gut, so everything
from your intestines

302
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,993
to your stomach, et cetera,

303
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,710
and your spleen or sending
information also up to the brain.

304
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,530
So as I mentioned before,
it's a two-way street.

305
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,280
So the vagus nerve is
a very important nerve,

306
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,300
but just by saying vagus nerve,
it sounds like a singular.

307
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,640
It sounds like one thing,

308
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,870
but actually what we're
talking about is a series

309
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,780
of super highways, it's like Google maps,

310
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,080
it's got stuff going everywhere

311
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,943
with alternate routes,
communicating back and forth.

312
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,340
There are two fundamental
features of what's going

313
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,310
on in your body that
need to be communicated

314
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,450
to your brain, these neurons
in your brain stem in order

315
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,640
for your brain and your body
to work together correctly.

316
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,390
And the two types of information
are mechanical information.

317
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,550
So things like pressure,

318
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,350
things like lack of pressure
and chemical information,

319
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,320
whether or not your gut is acidic

320
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,630
or whether or not it's not acidic,

321
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,613
whether or not you have some
sort of pathogen, you know,

322
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,360
something that you ate or that
got into your body somehow

323
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,080
and is making you sick or whether or not

324
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,110
you don't have a pathogen in your body.

325
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,020
So you've got mechanical
sensing and chemical sensing.

326
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,290
So when you think about your sense

327
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,070
of self and your ability
to understand what's going

328
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,030
on in your body, if you feel
good, or if you feel bad,

329
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,010
your sense of self is
dependent on these mechanical

330
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,890
phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon.

331
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,950
And for every organ in your body,

332
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,060
whether or not that's
your heart or your lungs

333
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,020
or your spleen, both the
mechanical information about

334
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,020
that organ for instance, is
if your gut is full or empty,

335
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,860
whether or not your heart is
beating fast or beating slowly,

336
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,680
that's mechanical, and
chemical information,

337
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,360
whether or not your gut feels
nice, and whether, you know,

338
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
when I say nice, I mean,

339
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,810
whether or not it has a balance
of acidity and alkalinity,

340
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,210
that feels right to you or
whether or not your gut feels

341
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,730
off, it doesn't feel quite right.

342
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,770
That's chemical information.

343
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,340
If you are not getting enough oxygen

344
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,540
and levels of carbon dioxide
and other gas go up too high.

345
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,710
So your lungs can register

346
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,030
that and that chemical
information is sent to your brain.

347
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,180
And then your brain does
certain things actually really

348
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,630
encourages you to do certain things

349
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,403
in order to adjust that chemistry.

350
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,210
So the first principle that
everyone should understand about

351
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,890
their sense of self is that
they are sensing mechanical

352
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,940
and chemical information about every organ

353
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,540
in their body, except for
one, and that's the brain.

354
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,240
Your brain actually doesn't
have pain receptors.

355
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,040
It doesn't even have touch receptors.

356
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,840
The brain is a command center.

357
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,180
It helps drive and govern changes
in the organs of the body.

358
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,970
But your brain doesn't
move, at least not much.

359
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,530
It can move a little bit
fluid moves within it.

360
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,500
But as long as you're healthy,
it's not moving that much.

361
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,570
Your brain has no sensation

362
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,970
of its own, in fact, when they
do brain surgery on people,

363
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,070
they will the size or put
some anesthesia on the scalp.

364
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,070
They'll cut away the skin there

365
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,853
so that people don't feel anything.

366
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,260
They'll use some anesthesia
they'll peel back the skin

367
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,156
and then they'll use a,

368
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:54,660
let's call it what it is, it's a bone saw.

369
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,000
And they basically saw open
a little window in the skull.

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,040
I've actually done this
before and seen this before.

371
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,860
I've done this many times before,

372
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,980
and once you're inside the brain,

373
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,980
you can put electrodes in
there and you can put various

374
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,860
things in there, of course,
all for therapeutic purposes.

375
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,980
And you do that without any
anesthesia to the actual brain

376
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,180
tissue, because it has no
receptors to sense anything.

377
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,950
It doesn't have pain receptors.

378
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,300
It doesn't have pressure receptors.

379
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,080
None of that, when you have a headache

380
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,540
in your head, feels like
it's too much pressure,

381
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,770
well that's because of here's
that lie outside the brain.

382
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,840
So your organs are different.

383
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,090
They need to tell your
brain what's going on.

384
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,940
And there are ways that you
can control the mechanical

385
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,510
and the chemical state of your organs

386
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,650
in ways that are very
powerful, and this is crucial

387
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,990
to do, because if you can
properly regulate the mechanical

388
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,130
and chemical environment

389
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,983
of your body, your brain functions better.

390
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,980
This is absolutely clear from data

391
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,360
that if your gut is healthy,

392
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,760
if you get the alkalinity
right, the acidity, right,

393
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,290
and if your spleen is healthy

394
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,840
and happy, and if your
lungs are working properly,

395
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,210
not just breathing and
pumping in and out air,

396
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,450
but you're breathing at the
right cadence for a particular

397
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,750
activity, then your brain
will function better.

398
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,000
So let's talk about how you
can adjust the mechanical

399
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,300
and chemical environment of your organs

400
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,000
in order to make your brain better

401
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,390
and how your brain can make the mechanical

402
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,540
and chemical environment within
your organs function better.

403
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,200
For instance we're going to talk about

404
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,349
how you can change the
chemistry of your gut in order

405
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,320
for your brain to be able to
focus better, think better,

406
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,270
remember better and sleep better.

407
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,420
And we're going to talk
about how you can change

408
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,930
the chemistry of other
organs in your body,

409
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,060
such that your immune
system will function better

410
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,283
than it would otherwise.

411
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,100
And you can actually heal
faster from small cuts and

412
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,940
bruises, but also injuries of
any kind, even major injuries.

413
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,900
So as I mentioned before,
we've got these organs,

414
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,160
the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm,

415
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,810
and I'll explain what that
is, the gut and the spleen.

416
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,540
And the spleen is this immune organ.

417
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,240
Let's take one example of these
and explain how mechanical

418
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,430
and chemical information
from this particular set

419
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,040
of organs communicates to the brain

420
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,460
and how that changes how our brain works.

421
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,100
And the organ I'd like to focus on first

422
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,550
are the lungs and the diaphragm.

423
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,900
So we're all familiar with
our lungs, these two big bags

424
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,510
of air, but they're actually
not two big bags of air.

425
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,860
They actually have little
tiny sacs within them,

426
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,640
actually millions of little sacs

427
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,710
called the alveoli of the lungs.

428
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,680
The alveoli of the lungs

429
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,693
are like little tiny balloons
throughout our lungs,

430
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,560
and the more of those balloons, we have,

431
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,340
the more air that we can actually contain.

432
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,700
So we are not too big bags
of air in there, our lungs,

433
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,700
we actually have millions and
millions of little tiny bags

434
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,033
of air within those lungs.

435
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,450
Those little bags of air can
fill up or they can deflate,

436
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,700
right, just like your
lungs overall can fill up

437
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,210
or they can deflate.

438
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,660
The diaphragm is a muscle, it's
kind of shaped like a dome.

439
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,870
So it's kind of a, you know,

440
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,870
think about a basketball or a soccer ball

441
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,320
that has most of the air pushed out of it.

442
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,110
And so it's kind of crescent
shape or dome shaped,

443
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,257
and it sits below our lungs
and the way the diaphragm

444
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:09,460
and the lungs work together
is very interesting.

445
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,400
The diaphragm is actually
skeletal muscles.

446
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,580
So it's just like a bicep or a quadricep.

447
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,160
And the fact that it is
skeletal muscle is important

448
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,640
because it has a unique property,

449
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
which is that you can
control it voluntarily.

450
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,560
You can decide to take control

451
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,830
of your diaphragm by just
consciously deciding you want

452
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,380
to breathe in a particular way,

453
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,070
just like you can take conscious
control over your legs.

454
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,680
They will work just fine,
if you're not thinking

455
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,630
about them, as you walk as
provide, you already know

456
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,135
how to walk, but at any moment,

457
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:36,968
you can decide to change the rate

458
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:40,090
of your walking, your
so-called cadence of walking.

459
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,780
So the diaphragm as a
skeletal muscle also has

460
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,860
that property, the diaphragm moves up

461
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,770
and down, depending on how you breathe,

462
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,740
or rather, I should say
how the diaphragm moves up

463
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
and down determines how you breathe.

464
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,220
How you breathe is also dependent
on little muscles that are

465
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,160
between your ribs, the
intercostals and other muscles,

466
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,540
if you're a martial arts fan
that Bruce Lee was famous

467
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,400
for having these very pronounced
intercostals from doing all

468
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,850
sorts of, you know, bridging
exercise, et cetera.

469
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,320
But those are the muscles.

470
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,410
And we all have them, even if some

471
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,780
of us, most of us don't have,
intercostals like Bruce Lee.

472
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,590
So when you breathe a
couple things happen,

473
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,040
but let's talk about the
mechanical things first.

474
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,310
And then let's talk about how
those mechanical steps relate

475
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,570
back to the brain and what
that does for the brain.

476
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,130
And I can promise you that

477
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,310
if you develop an awareness
of these mechanical changes,

478
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,100
you do not have to go through
extensive breathwork practice

479
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,050
or do extensive breathwork.

480
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,980
You will immediately believe
it or not develop a sense

481
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,510
of your breathing self of
your lungs and diaphragm.

482
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,800
It takes no practice, but once you do it,

483
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
you will forever be changed
in terms of your awareness of

484
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,810
your breathing and your ability
to leverage your breathing.

485
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,000
Kind of like the steering
wheel on a car in order

486
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,670
to shift your brain in the
direction that you want to go.

487
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,480
So it's a very powerful system.

488
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,340
And the way it works is the following.

489
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,887
And this will also
incorporate the heart, so,

490
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,270
and by the heart, I don't mean
it in the emotional sense.

491
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,500
Although we don't rule out emotions here

492
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,760
at the Huberman Lab
podcast, we like emotions,

493
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,710
but I'm talking about the heart

494
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,410
as an organ, as a beating
organ, that circulates blood.

495
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,410
So when we inhale, these little
sacs in our lungs fill up

496
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,480
and our lungs expand.

497
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,370
And when we do that, we take
up space in our thoracic cavity

498
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,880
and our diaphragm moves down, okay.

499
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,730
When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

500
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,470
the lungs get smaller, okay?

501
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,130
So inhales, diaphragm moves down.

502
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,963
Exhales, diaphragm moves up.

503
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,470
This actually controls our heart rate,

504
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,040
but it does it by changing
the way that our brain works.

505
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,770
And it works in the following way.

506
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,110
So when we inhale, our lungs
fill our diaphragm moves down.

507
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,140
Our heart actually has a little more space

508
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,010
because the diaphragm's moved down.

509
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,720
So the heart gets a little
bit bigger, physically bigger,

510
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,700
not in the emotional sense,
but physically bigger.

511
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,810
And as a consequence,

512
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:10,130
whatever blood is in the
heart flows at a slower rate

513
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,550
because it's a larger volume,
so bigger volume heart,

514
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,360
same amount of blood inside
the heart means slower flow.

515
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,340
Okay, sort of like expanding a pipe.

516
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,590
The brain registers that
because there are a set

517
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,570
of neurons in the heart
called the sinoatrial node.

518
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,723
It sends that information to the brain.

519
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,380
That information is registered
by the brain and the brain

520
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,720
sends a message back to the
heart to speed the heart up.

521
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,290
So every time you inhale because
of these mechanical changes

522
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,410
in the diaphragm and lungs,

523
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,400
and because of the mechanical
changes in the heart,

524
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,470
your brain sends a signal to
the heart to speed the heart

525
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,470
up, so if you do long inhales
or you inhale more vigorously,

526
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,520
you actually are speeding your heart up.

527
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,930
Now, of course you have to exhale as well.

528
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,423
But for instance, if I were
to inhale very long like

529
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:00,870
[inhales heavily]

530
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,810
the entire time my heart
rate is increasing.

531
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,571
And then if I did a quick exhale,

532
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:05,450
[exhales quickly]

533
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,015
something else will happen,
but if I kept doing that,

534
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:10,470
[inhales heavily, exhales quickly]

535
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,120
my heart rate would increase.

536
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,170
It's not going to increase
linearly and forever,

537
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,050
but it will increase with each inhale.

538
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,855
Or I can simply make my
inhales more vigorous.

539
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,070
[inhales quickly]

540
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,560
And my heart rate will speed up.

541
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,380
This is an autonomic and
automatic relationship

542
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,170
between the diaphragm, the
lungs, the brain, and the heart.

543
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,000
Now, if inhale speed the heart
up, what happens on exhales?

544
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,110
When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

545
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,200
It's a little counterintuitive,

546
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,050
but you can kind of think about it

547
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,240
as like pushing the plunge
on a syringe, right?

548
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,550
When you exhale,

549
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,890
this thing moves up and
as the diaphragm moves up,

550
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,320
the heart has less space.

551
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,410
Meaning it gets a little bit smaller,

552
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,570
which means that whatever
volume of blood is inside the

553
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,180
heart moves faster, through
that smaller volume,

554
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,640
that information is sent to
the brain via these collection

555
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,460
of neurons called the sinoatrial
node for you aficionados.

556
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,730
The brain then sends information
via the vagus nerve back

557
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,030
to the heart, to slow the heart down.

558
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,010
So while inhales speed up the heart,

559
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,370
that's the net effect
exhales, slow the heart down.

560
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,010
And the reason they slow the heart down is

561
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,130
because of a register in the
change in mechanical pressure

562
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,810
between the diaphragm,
the lungs and the heart.

563
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,100
So this is to me, the simplest

564
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,930
and most straightforward example

565
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,360
of how the brain is changing
the way our organs work,

566
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,990
our heart in this case,

567
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,900
according to changes in
mechanical interoception.

568
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,740
Now, we're not always aware
of this, some of us are aware

569
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,961
of it, some of us aren't.

570
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,300
If you do it right now,

571
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,410
you will be aware of
it, so you can try this.

572
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,410
You can basically, this is an experiment

573
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,640
or an example in interoception,
in sensing one's self.

574
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,180
So if you inhale, doesn't
matter how long you inhale.

575
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,097
I'll do it for a couple seconds

576
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,532
[inhales quickly]

577
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:01,048
and then exhale twice as long.

578
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,490
[exhales slowly]

579
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,090
Nose or mouth, doesn't
matter, the entire time

580
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,090
that you're exhaling, you're
slowing your heart down.

581
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,800
So just as a car has an
accelerator and a brake,

582
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,750
or you can slow a car by
coming off the accelerator.

583
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,583
When you exhale,

584
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,540
you're effectively coming
off the accelerator,

585
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,410
or if you want to think
about it differently,

586
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,610
you're hitting the brake,

587
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,720
you're slowing down your heart rate.

588
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,389
Now, normally your heart
rate stays in more or less

589
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,250
the same range for a given activity

590
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,500
because you're inhaling and exhaling.

591
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,490
But this is just a simple way of showing

592
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,240
that mechanical changes in
your viscera can change the way

593
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,290
that your brain works

594
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,920
and then your brain changes the
way that those viscera work.

595
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,440
And it's a very concrete agreement,

596
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,380
it's like a contract between the organs

597
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,400
of your body and the brain.

598
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,320
In fact, you can think about
this contract in more detail,

599
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,490
and you can leverage this
in a very powerful way

600
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,423
to set the conditions of your mind.

601
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,300
If you want to be more
calm, emphasize exhales,

602
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,440
and the simplest way to do this.

603
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,430
I've talked about this many times before,

604
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,680
but if you haven't heard me say it,

605
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,440
this will become immediately clear is

606
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,520
to emphasize exhales through

607
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,223
what's called a physiological sigh.

608
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:09,610
Two inhales, could be through
the nose of the mouth,

609
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,797
but ideally through the nose,
so [inhales quickly twice]

610
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,640
so followed by a long
exhale. [exhales slowly]

611
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,493
Those double inhales are
kind of important because

612
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,000
what they do is they maximally
fill all those little sacs

613
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,580
in your lungs, and then
when you breathe out,

614
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,040
you're exhaling as much of
the so-called carbon dioxide

615
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,190
in your system as possible.

616
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,170
We'll talk about carbon oxide in a second.

617
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,840
So the fastest way to calm
down is to emphasize exhales.

618
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,163
When you make exhales longer,

619
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:38,230
you're slowing your heart
rate, you're calming down.

620
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,900
You don't need any sophisticated training.

621
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,830
You don't have to do
this for minutes on end.

622
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,750
You don't have to do anything.

623
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,665
You don't even have to call it breathwork.

624
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,670
It's just respiration, and in
fact, you do this every night.

625
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,530
When you go to sleep and carbon
dioxide builds up too much

626
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,363
in your bloodstream,

627
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,220
or if you hold your breath or something,

628
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,460
or you watch an animal or a
small child that sleeping,

629
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,990
they will occasionally do these
double inhale long exhales

630
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,480
it's way of slowing the heart down

631
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,603
and eliminating carbon oxide.

632
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,550
The opposite is also true.

633
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,230
If you inhale deeply or vigorously

634
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,190
and then exhale less
long or less vigorously,

635
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,740
you will increase your level
of alertness through these

636
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,940
purely mechanical aspects
of your interoception.

637
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,107
So for instance, if I were
to take a big deep inhale

638
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:25,754
[inhales deeply] and then a short exhale,

639
00:27:25,754 --> 00:27:27,445
[exhales quickly] and then
another one, a big inhale,

640
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,740
[inhales deeply] short
exhale, [exhales quickly]

641
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,107
It only takes two or three of those

642
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,580
before you start to feel more alert.

643
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,400
And that's because your
heart rate is increasing.

644
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,642
And actually if you keep doing that

645
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:39,112
for 25 or 30 breaths of
inhale deep short exhale,

646
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:42,010
you will start to secrete
a lot of adrenaline.

647
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,560
This hormone that comes from your kidneys

648
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,660
and from your brainstem
make you feel really alert.

649
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,580
You will actually feel as if
you've had a cup of espresso.

650
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,380
So you will immediately wake up.

651
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,390
And there's an intermediate form

652
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,410
of breathing, which is
sometimes called box breathing,

653
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,550
but it's really equal
inhale and exhale duration.

654
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,190
And these, it basically goes like this.

655
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,340
You're you're going to inhale,
so do this for maybe two,

656
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,458
three seconds inhale, [inhales]

657
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,978
then hold, okay, two, three seconds.

658
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,578
Then exhale, two, three seconds.

659
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,080
Then hold two, three seconds.

660
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,730
Most often people forget to hold.

661
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,070
So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold

662
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,720
for equal or more or less equal durations,

663
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,270
could be one second, could be two seconds,

664
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,370
could be three seconds.

665
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,360
Most people find that when you get

666
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,565
out past five seconds,
they start to struggle

667
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:28,883
to maintain the so-called box breathing.

668
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,550
And most people can't
consciously box breathe

669
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,110
for too terribly long without
having to think about it.

670
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:39,000
But the point here is that
through purely mechanical means

671
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,840
changing the way that you
breathe, emphasizing inhales

672
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,280
or exhales, or keeping them the same

673
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,190
will change the way that your brain works,

674
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,840
how alert you are and how
well you function in anything.

675
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,190
And again, this doesn't mean
that breathwork has no value.

676
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,460
It's just simply to say
that long extended protocols

677
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,150
of breathwork are simply,

678
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,090
they are truly simply just
an exploration of this

679
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,580
fundamental relationship
between the mechanics

680
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,080
of your internal organs and your brain

681
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,140
and how your brain controls
those internal organs.

682
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,750
Now you might ask, well,
how is this pressure known?

683
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,530
How does the body actually know
how full the lungs are, now?

684
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,430
This is an answer that's more
for the aficionados out there,

685
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,580
but I've had a few requests,

686
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,110
or I should say thousands of
requests for more in-depth

687
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,290
science, so if you're not
interested more in depth science,

688
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,550
just this will allow you to
tune out now for maybe just 10

689
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,080
seconds, and if you are
interested, pay careful attention,

690
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,846
there is a set of receptors

691
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:35,300
which are called piezo receptors,

692
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,800
P-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors,
piezo means pressure.

693
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,890
And these were discovered
a few years ago by a couple

694
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,960
of different laboratories,
but one of the main ones,

695
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,767
one of the main laboratories

696
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:47,970
that discovered these piezo receptors

697
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,570
is the laboratory of Ardem Patapoutian.

698
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,580
I love saying his name,

699
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,570
even though I'm probably pronouncing it,

700
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,320
he's a friend and a former
colleague when my lab was down

701
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,810
in San Diego, he's at
the Scripps Institute,

702
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,280
he's a Howard Hughes Medical
Institute investigator,

703
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,100
which basically means
that he's a total stud

704
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,650
of science and has made
many important discoveries.

705
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,480
The piezo receptors line many tissues,

706
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,290
and inform the brain about
pressure in those tissues.

707
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,600
But the lungs have a particular category

708
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,740
of piezo receptors called
piezo two receptors.

709
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,440
And as you fill your lungs
and these little sacs

710
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,860
of air, the alveoli fill,
the piezo two receptors

711
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,740
because of the way they
react to that filling

712
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,640
send information by way
of a bunch of neurons,

713
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,990
a bunch of wires up to the
brain and tell you how full your

714
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,330
lungs are, so that's the
kind of mechanistic detail.

715
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,590
If you want to learn more about that,

716
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,610
you can look up our
Ardem's lab at the Scripps

717
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,770
and the beautiful work that
they and other laboratories

718
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,420
are doing on piezos,
piezos are pretty cool.

719
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,250
I think I also just like saying piezo,

720
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,320
so that's why I brought that up as well.

721
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,630
So mechanical sensing of the
lungs, heart and diaphragm.

722
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,320
And now let's talk about chemical sensing

723
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,600
because there's carbon
dioxide and there's oxygen.

724
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,380
And this is really simple.

725
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,270
You have oxygen and carbon
dioxide and you need them both.

726
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,230
I sometimes hear people
talk about carbon dioxide

727
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,040
is this bad thing and
oxygen, it has a good thing.

728
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,475
You need them both,

729
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:13,930
and you need them in
the appropriate balance.

730
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,430
You have a collection of neurons
in your brain that register

731
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,230
when carbon dioxide levels
get to a certain point

732
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,070
in your bloodstream.

733
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,890
When that point, that
threshold is reached,

734
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,040
these neurons fire,

735
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,440
and they cause you to
breathe sometimes called

736
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,330
the gasp reflex, it just
makes you want to inhale.

737
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,860
And as a consequence,
you bring in more oxygen.

738
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,600
Okay, so we don't really
breathe to get oxygen.

739
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,600
That's a by-product of inhaling
to eliminate carbon dioxide.

740
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,150
You don't want carbon dioxide
levels to go too high.

741
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,320
In fact, if you want to freak
somebody out and we do these

742
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,430
in experiments, and I don't
recommend you do this,

743
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,940
you just increase the levels
of carbon dioxide that they

744
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,850
inhale, and the brain will go
into an almost immediate panic

745
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,170
response because the health
of all our tissues depends on

746
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,840
keeping a nice balance between
carbon dioxide and oxygen.

747
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,380
You don't want carbon dioxide
levels to go too high.

748
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,410
So the impulse to breathe,
if you're under water,

749
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,150
or if you hold your breath is triggered

750
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,320
by these neurons and the
triggering of those neurons comes

751
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,910
from elevated carbon
dioxide in the bloodstream.

752
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,440
And for those of you that don't quite know

753
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,020
how to conceptualize the relationship

754
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,040
between bloodstream and breath,

755
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,290
I do think it's important.

756
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,970
And maybe you remember this
from high school biology,

757
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,030
but if you don't,

758
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,300
I'll make it clear for
you now, it's very easy.

759
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,300
You inhale air and that air
and the oxygen molecules

760
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,100
in that air actually move

761
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,030
from your lungs into the bloodstream

762
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,381
because these little alveoli of the lungs,

763
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,990
those little sacs of air are in there,

764
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,640
they basically have a lot
of little micro vessels

765
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,500
and capillaries, little tiny,
basically blood vessels,

766
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,140
essentially, although
they're mostly capillaries,

767
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,815
micro capillaries are
the little tiny ones,

768
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:58,050
that line them, so there's actually

769
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,350
an interface and opportunity for air

770
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,300
and molecules within the
air to pass into the blood

771
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,540
and then they move in your
bloodstream, and when you exhale,

772
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,710
the opposite is true.

773
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,640
So you can move things from the air,

774
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,740
into your bloodstream or from
your bloodstream into the air

775
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,650
by way of the lungs, and
there's a lot more detail to it.

776
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,960
And I'm sure those of you
that are experts out there.

777
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,540
If you want to put some
stuff in the comments,

778
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,020
maybe a little bit of a kind
of intermediate tutorial,

779
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,720
you might even entitle
it, intermediate tutorial.

780
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,960
If you know a lot about
this, just I'll check it,

781
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,210
but make sure you get the details, right.

782
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,200
Make sure you know the process.

783
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,910
And I find that for
people that are interested

784
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,880
in understanding how
breathing really works,

785
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,630
it's really nice to think
about the relationship

786
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,418
between the heart and the vascular system,

787
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:44,420
the blood and the air system,
the respiration system,

788
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,170
and breathing, because those
two things are very, we say,

789
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,340
they're interdigitated, they're
interwoven with one another.

790
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,290
So how does this work, well,
carbon dioxide is too high,

791
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,080
you breathe in, you inspire, you,

792
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,470
inhale you off as a consequence,

793
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,030
when you exhale, you
offload carbon dioxide.

794
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,320
There's a really cool way
that you can explore this

795
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,380
chemistry of your breathing
and your bloodstream

796
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
and the way that your brain works

797
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,714
in ways that can really
benefit your health.

798
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,300
And it works the following way.

799
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,010
You want to essentially sit or lie down.

800
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,283
It doesn't really matter.

801
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,979
You definitely don't want
to be anywhere near water,

802
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,690
not a bathtub, not a hot
tub, not a, you know,

803
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,270
not a cold dunk or something.

804
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,730
In fact, don't even be in a puddle.

805
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,000
And what you want to do

806
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,905
in this case is you're
going to breathe in deep.

807
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:32,750
So that's going to increase
your heart rate and then exhale

808
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,110
passively by just letting
air fall out of your mouth.

809
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,753
So it will look something like this.

810
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:38,090
[inhales vigorously, exhales passively]

811
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,719
So it's you breathe in vigorously

812
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:43,829
and then you let the air
just fall out of your mouth.

813
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,110
When you do that,

814
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,730
what you're essentially
doing is you're bringing

815
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,310
in a lot of oxygen
through that deep breath.

816
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,610
And you're exhaling a little
bit of that carbon dioxide.

817
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,370
But if you were to repeat
it 25 times, maybe 30 times,

818
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,860
it doesn't matter if it's 25
or 30, somewhere in there,

819
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,730
you would essentially start
bringing in a lot of oxygen

820
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,330
and blowing off or exhaling
a lot of carbon dioxide.

821
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,900
So you're actually going
to change the chemistry

822
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,090
of your internal landscape,
and you can then sense it.

823
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,880
You can interocept what that is like.

824
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,040
And there are some really
interesting reasons

825
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,240
for wanting to do that, so
I'm not going to do all 25

826
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,680
or 30 now, maybe do five or 10,

827
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,960
so you can get a sense
of what it looks like,

828
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,280
so that it's clear.

829
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,988
I'm going to essentially
demonstrate now, so it's inhale,

830
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:28,990
[inhales vigorously]

831
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,634
exhale through the mouth,[exhales]
I am inhaling the nose,

832
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:37,634
[inhales vigorously, exhales
passively multiple times]

833
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,660
So it's essentially, excuse
me, a two second or so inhale

834
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,070
and then a one second or so
exhale, and as I was doing that,

835
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,278
I can kind of feel my face get
flush and my body is heating

836
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:50,860
up and my brain is heating
up, what's happening there?

837
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,170
Well that pattern of breathing

838
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,130
is increasing levels of adrenaline

839
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,063
in my brain and body, and
I'm getting more alert.

840
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,743
Then after 25 or 30 of those,
you exhale all your air.

841
00:36:03,743 --> 00:36:05,050
[exhales deeply]

842
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,477
You dump all your air.

843
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:08,970
You can do that, your nose or your mouth.

844
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,200
And then you hold your
breath with your lungs empty

845
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,760
for about 15 to 30 seconds.

846
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,120
Now, for those of you that want

847
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,930
to explore this, and please be
careful as you explore this,

848
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,679
don't do anything stupid,

849
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:22,290
like do this while you're
driving or something like that.

850
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,230
You can exhale all your air

851
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,330
and what you'll find then
is you can hold your breath

852
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,840
for a very long time.

853
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,700
And the reason you can do that
is because you've blown off

854
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,740
all the carbon dioxide or
most of the carbon dioxide

855
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,573
in your bloodstream.

856
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,880
So you shifted the chemistry of your blood

857
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,380
by breathing in a particular way.

858
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,350
And by doing that,

859
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,910
you are no longer triggering these neurons

860
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,620
that cause the gasp reflex
or the reflex to breathe.

861
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,210
Now, of course you have
to breathe sooner or later

862
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,270
but what you'll find is if
normally your ability to hold

863
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,410
your breath is a minute or
so before you really feel

864
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,300
that gasp reflex kick in,

865
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,330
you might find that you can
go 90 seconds or two minutes.

866
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,250
And with some practice,

867
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,820
people find that they can
start holding their breath

868
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,170
for three or four minutes or longer.

869
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,900
This is actually how free
divers do what they do.

870
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,250
I do not want anyone free diving.

871
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,610
If you're going to learn free diving,

872
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,650
please learn it from an expert.

873
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,230
Many people die trying to teach
themselves out of free dive

874
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,760
or trying to teach their
friends at a free dive

875
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,320
when they don't know what they're doing.

876
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,240
This is not what this
is about, don't again,

877
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,720
don't do this anywhere near water,

878
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,060
but it is a very interesting
exploration of how you can

879
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,520
shift the chemistry of your
bloodstream by modulating your

880
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,120
air by modulating the mechanics
of your diaphragm and lungs

881
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,917
and thereby shift the way
your mind works, your brain.

882
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:39,480
And in fact, what you'll
notice is that even though

883
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,669
during that 25 or 30 breaths,

884
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:43,430
[inhales and exhales quickly]

885
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,240
you'll feel very alert,
when you exhale all your air

886
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,560
and you're in the breath hold,
you will feel very alert,

887
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,683
but very calm.

888
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,040
Now this is interesting

889
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,970
because it's a state that we all sort

890
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,640
of want to achieve alert, but calm,

891
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,250
but have a hard time achieving.

892
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,010
And so for those of you that
have a hard time obtaining

893
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,810
focus for sake of work or
focus for sake of anything I

894
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,220
should say, and when you
are able to achieve focus,

895
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,170
it's through the use of
things like stimulants,

896
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,030
or you feel like you have
to have a cold shower

897
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,200
or ice bath, or you have to
have four espresso in order

898
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,640
to be alert, but then you're
too alert, you're jittery.

899
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,950
You can't focus.

900
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,990
This pattern of breathing
can lend itself very well

901
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,390
to entering states of alert,
but calm for the fall,

902
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,180
the 10 or even 20 minutes
that follow that breathing.

903
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,880
And then you could repeat it if you want.

904
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,300
So it's a very useful practice to explore.

905
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,670
Some of you may be familiar

906
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,985
with this practice and
so-called Wim Hof breathing.

907
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,750
Wim Hof is a practitioner of
what's called Tumo breathing.

908
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,800
Tumo breathing has been
around for centuries.

909
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,000
And for those of you that are familiar

910
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,120
with breathwork and yoga practices,

911
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,510
I acknowledged that nothing
I just described is new based

912
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,164
on science, however,

913
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,930
the science informs why
those practices work.

914
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,890
And just as a little mini editorial,

915
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,210
I just want to emphasize as well.

916
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,790
That one thing that this podcast
is really about is trying

917
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,400
to remove fancy nomenclature, whether

918
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,120
or not it's yogic nomenclature
or scientific nomenclature

919
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,684
so that people can access protocols.

920
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,930
Because the moment we start
naming things after people

921
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,250
or calling them Tumo et cetera,
I have no problem with that,

922
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,450
but it doesn't inform how
the practices are done,

923
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,570
nor does it inform the
underlying mechanisms.

924
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,860
So here I'm trying to
teach you the mechanisms.

925
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,730
And as a final point to that,

926
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,750
the most powerful form
of breathing is the one

927
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,678
that takes into account

928
00:39:32,678 --> 00:39:35,270
the fundamental mechanisms
that in increase heart rate,

929
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:39,480
that exhales decrease heart
rate, and that carbon dioxide

930
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,330
and oxygen relate to the
bloodstream and the brain

931
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,470
in particular ways, once you
understand those components,

932
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,170
then you can create your own
so-called breathwork practices.

933
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,930
You can breathe in the
ways that best serve you,

934
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,230
as opposed to thinking that
one protocol is the best

935
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,080
or holy protocol for everything,
because it's simply not.

936
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,940
As a final final point,

937
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,560
I want to say that as you
shift the way that you breathe,

938
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,940
whether or not you're showing
off more carbon dioxide

939
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,240
or bringing in more oxygen,

940
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,950
you are fundamentally
changing the chemistry

941
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,250
of your internal milieu have your body,

942
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,210
and that has been shown
to have important effects

943
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,620
on the way that your immune
system functions and the way

944
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,700
that you deal with
inflammation and all sorts

945
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,750
of different sort of things
that can enter your body

946
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,260
and cause problems or
conditions of stress, et cetera.

947
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,190
So I will explore that further
as the episode goes on,

948
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,920
but I want to move on to just
touch on one other aspect

949
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
of reading, that's purely mechanical,

950
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,410
which I think is very interesting

951
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,980
and important, which relates
to a particular reflex

952
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,250
that you're going to be very
familiar with in a second.

953
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,730
And that can serve you very
well in times of extreme stress.

954
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,100
The reflex I'm referring to

955
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,790
is something called the
Hering Breuer Reflex.

956
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,070
I'm not going to go into details

957
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,960
about how the Hering Breuer reflex works,

958
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,610
but it has to do with particular classes

959
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,410
of neurons and cells that
are called a Baroreceptors.

960
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,240
Those are basically pressure
receptors, they sense pressure.

961
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,390
And basically what the
Hering Breuer reflex is

962
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,340
about is that when your lung is inflated,

963
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,040
your desire to breathe is reduced.

964
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,365
So you can try that
right now, you can inhale

965
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:20,177
[inhales] huge big thing of air.

966
00:41:22,215 --> 00:41:23,457
And hold, okay?

967
00:41:23,457 --> 00:41:26,440
Your desire to breathe
will kick in later than

968
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,430
were are you to exhale all
your air and hold your breath.

969
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,220
When you exhale all your
air and your breath,

970
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,470
unless you've done the sort
of protocol I described a few

971
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,040
minutes ago of doing a bunch
of inhales and exhales first

972
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,070
in a very deliberate
way, you will feel empty.

973
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,750
Those Baroreceptors are
going to be firing like crazy

974
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,900
saying, there's no pressure in here,

975
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,140
there's no pressure here,
I got nothing in here.

976
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,480
You need to breathe,
you need to breathe in,

977
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,980
the gasp reflex will kick in sooner.

978
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,730
You can apply that in all
sorts of situations related

979
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,170
to exercise, related to
modulating stress, et cetera.

980
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,260
So the Hering Breuer reflex
is a very powerful one.

981
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,980
This is why you take a big deep breath

982
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,858
before you go under
water. [inhales heavily]

983
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,200
All right, you're not going

984
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,040
to exhale all your air and go under water.

985
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,530
If you were to exhale all
your air and go under water,

986
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,790
you would absolutely feel
the need to come up sooner

987
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,570
for a breath of air than
had you a full tank,

988
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,610
so to speak a full of lungs full of air.

989
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,560
And this is also the way
that people teach themselves

990
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,710
to feel comfortable under water.

991
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,700
So when you learn how to swim,

992
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,290
you learn how to swim both by having air

993
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,930
in your lungs while you're
underwater and no air

994
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,960
in your lungs while you're underwater.

995
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,770
In any event the Hering
Breuer reflex is yet another

996
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:40,470
dimension to the way that
mechanical pressure influences

997
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,460
your brain's decision-making,
about what to do

998
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,220
with your body, in this case,
whether or not to breathe.

999
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,640
So now I want to shift away from breathing

1000
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,210
and diaphragm and lungs and
move toward another organ

1001
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,290
within our viscera, which is our gut.

1002
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,370
So this includes our stomach

1003
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,580
and our intestines, our
esophagus and so forth.

1004
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,020
It's been said before,
both by me and by others

1005
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,130
that we are, but a series of
tubes, and indeed that's true.

1006
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,870
Believe it or not, every
system in your body is a tube.

1007
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,060
Your brain is actually a tube
that connects your spinal

1008
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,650
cord, which has also a tube.

1009
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,110
You started off as a tube,
you were like a churro.

1010
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,240
You know, those churros

1011
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,450
I don't know if you're
not familiar with churros,

1012
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,680
they're like donuts that
are shaped like a tube.

1013
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,080
That's essentially what you
look like early in development,

1014
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,790
not long after conception
and the front end

1015
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,080
of that churro grew and grew and grew,

1016
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,560
but you always maintained
a hollow through that tube.

1017
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,960
That's why you have what are
called ventricles, gaps or a

1018
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,980
space in your brain and spinal
cord that run the length

1019
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,010
of your brain and spinal cord

1020
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,900
and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid,

1021
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,900
and other things move through that space.

1022
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,380
We're going to return
to the ventricles later,

1023
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,320
they are very important.

1024
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,580
They're just space filled
with fluid, but they do a lot.

1025
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,260
Similarly your digestive system

1026
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,150
starts with the tube at your mouth

1027
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,640
and of course goes down
through your throat.

1028
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,770
And then you've got all
the elements of the stomach

1029
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,340
and the intestines, and then
it comes out the other end.

1030
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,370
So you are, but a series
of different tubes,

1031
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,640
your vascular system, a
series of other tubes.

1032
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,123
So you're tubes.

1033
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,037
The way your digestive system works

1034
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:16,620
is to communicate to your brain

1035
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,470
about the status of the
mechanical pressures

1036
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,020
along this tube, so within your stomach

1037
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,570
and your intestines, et cetera,

1038
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,680
and the chemical status of
that tube at various portions

1039
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,400
within that tube to inform your brain

1040
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,253
about how your brain
should control that tube.

1041
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,093
So let's start with the
mechanical sensing of your gut.

1042
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,160
If you drink a lot of fluid,
or if you eat a lot of food,

1043
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,080
your gut will fill up, your
stomach will fill up with food.

1044
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,290
Now it gets digested there.

1045
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,860
It gets digested elsewhere
along your digestive track too,

1046
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,430
of course but it starts
getting digested there

1047
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,095
because along this tube,

1048
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:59,720
you have a series of what
are called sphincters,

1049
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,970
which basically are
like little draw pulls.

1050
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,210
Have you ever had a laundry bag,

1051
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,400
which has a drawstring on it?

1052
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,140
You pull it and then it cinches shut,

1053
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,340
and then you can open it
again, that's what those are.

1054
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,350
Those are sphincter
openings and you have them

1055
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,770
in your throat, you have them
along your digestive tract,

1056
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,920
all the way to the end.

1057
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,100
Food will enter your gut.

1058
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,320
And if there's a lot of that
food, pressure receptors,

1059
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,770
some of which are these
piezo receptors will

1060
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,930
communicate to the areas of
your brain that are involved

1061
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,930
in feeding, and we'll
say, don't eat anymore.

1062
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,660
You don't need to consume anymore, now,

1063
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,940
some people bypass that these,

1064
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,530
I guess they have these like
hotdog eating competitions.

1065
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,250
I'm always struck by how some
of those people are like,

1066
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,680
seem to be rail thin,

1067
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,060
but they actually train for
those competitions by ingesting

1068
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,870
large volumes of water, actually
a very dangerous practice.

1069
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,290
You can actually kill yourself
by drinking too much water,

1070
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,330
and you can kill yourself by
ingesting too much of anything,

1071
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,070
really to expand your
gut, not a good practice,

1072
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,100
not a big fan of those competitions.

1073
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,640
But even if you're one of those
people or you're the world

1074
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,930
heavyweight champion of them,

1075
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,400
they are informative
toward what I'm talking

1076
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,873
about now, which is that
as you expand the gut,

1077
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,760
a signal is sent by neurons,

1078
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,170
literally nerve cells that
are in the gut to the brain,

1079
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,510
stem up to the areas of
the brain that are involved

1080
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,560
in feeding, I did a
whole episode on feeding.

1081
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,000
You can find on "Feeding,
Metabolism And Hunger."

1082
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,780
You're welcome to listen to
that episode, if you like,

1083
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,880
and we'll shut down the
neurons that drive the desire

1084
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
to put more stuff in your mouth.

1085
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,580
That thing that people say sometimes

1086
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,410
on well in this country frequently
after Thanksgiving meal,

1087
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,420
I can't put another bite in my mouth.

1088
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,500
Literally they shut down
some of the basic movements

1089
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,570
of the musculature to
take another fork bite.

1090
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,135
I know it sounds crazy,

1091
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,690
but they can actually control your brain.

1092
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,820
So your gut is so full that
it's controlling your brains,

1093
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,370
such that this action of spooning food

1094
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,310
towards your mouth is actually inhibited.

1095
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,663
It's made more difficult
or less likely to occur.

1096
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,660
It's incredible.

1097
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,140
The converse is also true, when
these piezo receptors signal

1098
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,220
to the brain, that the
gut is empty independent

1099
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,440
of your need, your actual need for food.

1100
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,490
There's a signal that sent to
your brain that says gut is

1101
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,520
empty and neurons get stimulated
in areas like the arcuate

1102
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,410
nucleus and these areas
of the hypothalamus

1103
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,100
and et cetera, that drive the
desire to make this action,

1104
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,430
to open the mouth and to put
stuff in it in particular food.

1105
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,330
So when you find yourself
at the refrigerator

1106
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:30,610
or you find yourself almost, you know,

1107
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,780
manically trying to get
food of different cons,

1108
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,220
you're not even thinking
about what you're eating,

1109
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,440
because you're so hungry, in
part that's because the lack

1110
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,470
of food in your gut has sent
that information to your brain

1111
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,660
and is driving particular
fixed action patterns

1112
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,210
that are associated with eating, in fact,

1113
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,430
one of the first things
children learn how to do is open

1114
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,460
their mouth when something
is presented to it.

1115
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,090
And then they learn how
to move a spoon or a fork.

1116
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,405
They're not very good at
it, at first, they get all

1117
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:57,540
over the place, but
eventually they get good at,

1118
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,670
or at least most people get good at

1119
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,570
if you watch how people eat, you know,

1120
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:02,643
it's kind of very variable out there.

1121
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,010
In any event, this is a
purely mechanical phenomenon.

1122
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,640
And this purely mechanical
phenomenon is driving our brain

1123
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,910
to drive certain behavior.

1124
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,920
You can get better at registering sense

1125
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,470
of fullness or lack of fullness
in a very particular way.

1126
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,430
Some people have a very
keen sense of how full

1127
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,780
or empty their stomach is,
so if you've eaten anything,

1128
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,400
even if it's a small volume
of food in the last hour

1129
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,240
to three hours,

1130
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,920
it's actually a worthwhile
practice to take a few moments,

1131
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,460
maybe 10, 20 seconds,

1132
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,650
and actually just try and
concentrate on sensing the neurons

1133
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,730
in your gut and how full
you are, like for instance,

1134
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,100
I ate a few hours ago and
then I had a little snack

1135
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,330
about 30 minutes ago or so.

1136
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,290
And my gut feels neither
terribly full nor terribly empty.

1137
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:56,030
It's kind of, I would put it
kind of like 30, 40% okay.

1138
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,088
So by just taking conscious awareness

1139
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:01,530
of how full or empty our gut is

1140
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,370
at various times between
meals, after a meal,

1141
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,600
before a meal, you can very
quickly develop a sense

1142
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,840
of how full or empty you are.

1143
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,800
Now, what's the consequence of that?

1144
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,870
The consequence of that is
actually rather interesting.

1145
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,230
It's been shown that the consequence of

1146
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,460
that is actually that you can
better override the signals

1147
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,200
of these piezo receptors and
gut fullness or emptiness.

1148
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,170
So for those of you that
find that you eat kind

1149
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,190
of compulsively or non-consciously,

1150
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,180
or subconsciously, I should say,

1151
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,540
probably have to be conscious
enough to be awake to eat,

1152
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,457
but subconsciously you
just find yourself eating

1153
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:36,200
and here I'm describing myself, I'm like,

1154
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,060
I'm a drive by blueberry eater.

1155
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,040
If there's a bowl of blueberries,
every time I walk past it,

1156
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,380
I sort of have to grab a handful of them

1157
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,160
and pop them in my mouth,
but if you develop this sense

1158
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,900
of how much mecho-pressure,
it's not really word,

1159
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,020
but how much mechano-sensation
is in your gut, very quickly,

1160
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,010
you can learn to override that.

1161
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,409
You might ask, why would I
want to be able to override

1162
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:00,360
whether or not my stomach is
empty or my stomach is full?

1163
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,080
Well, there are many
reasons to want to do that.

1164
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,660
Many people right now are interested

1165
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,180
in so-called intermittent fasting.

1166
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,100
They're doing fast of
anywhere from 12 to 16 hours,

1167
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,150
every 24 hour cycle, that's
actually what my practice is.

1168
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,760
I do that on a regular
basis, sometimes the,

1169
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,335
I eat breakfast,

1170
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:16,890
but normally I pushed breakfast
out to about 11 or noon,

1171
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,100
or sometimes a little later,

1172
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,800
some people are doing longer fast,

1173
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:21,738
and there are really wonderful data

1174
00:50:21,738 --> 00:50:24,760
publishing excellent
journals from my colleagues

1175
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,960
Satchin Panda at the Salk
Institute Of Biological Studies.

1176
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,090
And of course from other
laboratories showing that

1177
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:34,490
intermittent fasting can and
will have some positive health

1178
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,560
effects on things like liver health

1179
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,240
and brain health and
other aspects of health.

1180
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,830
Whether or not it's the
best form of dieting

1181
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,350
for the sake of losing weight,
that's very controversial,

1182
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:48,080
but it's clear that having
a period of fasting every 24

1183
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,610
hours or perhaps even longer
from time to time can be

1184
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,750
beneficial because it stimulates
what's called autophagy,

1185
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,280
the clearing away,

1186
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,100
or the body's ability to
eat certain dead cells,

1187
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,440
so called senescent cells,
and for many people,

1188
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,450
they struggle with fasting
because they feel they have a

1189
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,550
very keen sense of their
stomach being empty.

1190
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,560
And they feel as if they have to eat.

1191
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,010
And in a kind of counter-intuitive way,

1192
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,710
there's some data that
indicate that being able

1193
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:18,010
to sense whether or not
your gut is full or empty,

1194
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,910
and just the knowledge that
that's communicating information

1195
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,780
to your brain about whether to not

1196
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,663
to eat or not just that awareness,

1197
00:51:26,555 --> 00:51:28,380
that understanding allows
them to override the signal.

1198
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,213
They think, oh, you know,

1199
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:31,490
I'm not actually in need
of nutrients right now.

1200
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,490
It's just that my stomach is empty.

1201
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,770
And these piezo receptors,

1202
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,250
and some other ones that I'll
tell you about in a moment

1203
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,270
are signaling to my brain that it's empty.

1204
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,760
I don't actually need food, it's just,

1205
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,480
it's just that my brain is reacting

1206
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,510
to the fact that my gut is deflated,

1207
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,380
so to speak or a smaller,
doesn't have food in it.

1208
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,010
So there are other ways that
our guts communicate with our

1209
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,650
brain, it's not just our
stomach talking to our brain.

1210
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,413
It's also our intestines
talk to our brain.

1211
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,660
The Liberles Lab the guy's
name is Steven Liberles,

1212
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,030
he runs a lab at Harvard Medical School,

1213
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,300
it's a terrific lab, does excellent work

1214
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,760
on gut, brain communication

1215
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,740
and other aspects of
viscera brain communication.

1216
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,130
They discovered a category

1217
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,433
of neurons called the GLP1R neurons,

1218
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,840
these are neurons that are basically

1219
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,700
in your neck, I mean, they're
part of the nervous system,

1220
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,460
but they're, you can, they
can be found near your neck.

1221
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,280
And those neurons send little wires down

1222
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,180
into the intestines and
deep into the stomach,

1223
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:35,130
but mostly into the intestines
and they sense stretch

1224
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,700
of your intestines.

1225
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,810
So this is pretty wild.

1226
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,390
These neurons sense how
stretched out your intestines are

1227
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,800
and how fast things are moving
through your intestines,

1228
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,780
slow or fast, or if there's nothing there.

1229
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,210
And then those neurons
send another branch,

1230
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,660
they have a branch in one direction,

1231
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,370
senses what's going on in your intestines.

1232
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,280
And they have another branch that goes up

1233
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,310
from your neck in your brain
to either trigger the desire

1234
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,720
to eat more or just stop eating.

1235
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,100
So these are really cool neurons

1236
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,470
and they're basically stretch receptors.

1237
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,030
They look a lot like the piezo receptors

1238
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,090
that we talked about before,
so these GLP1R neurons

1239
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,170
are sensing stretch, so
purely mechanical sensing.

1240
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,900
And in addition to that,

1241
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,530
the Liberles Lab discovered neurons

1242
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,080
that detect nutrients themselves.

1243
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,680
Now, the main reason why we need

1244
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,620
to eat is to bring
nutrients into our body.

1245
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,030
And there is another set of neurons,

1246
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,740
those are called GPR65 neurons,

1247
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,050
if you want to know, but you
don't have to remember that,

1248
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,950
do the same thing in terms
of their connections.

1249
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,160
They send connections down into
the intestines and into the

1250
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,030
gut, into the stomach, but
mostly into the intestines.

1251
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,260
And then send that information back up

1252
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,880
to the brain as to whether or
not there are certain kinds

1253
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,140
of nutrients in our digestive track.

1254
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,380
Now, these neurons are the
ones to pay attention to

1255
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,370
if we're talking about chemical signaling

1256
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,230
and then in the next couple of minutes,

1257
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,810
I'm going to tell you about
how you can understand hunger

1258
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,890
and had a modulate your
hunger for the right foods,

1259
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,250
in fact, for healthy foods.

1260
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:02,420
The way this is done is
by leveraging the activity

1261
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,660
of these GPR65 neurons,

1262
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,556
these neurons that sense nutrients, okay.

1263
00:54:07,556 --> 00:54:09,080
They're telling your brain

1264
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,560
what's in your gut and intestines,

1265
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,870
and you have another set of
neurons that were discovered

1266
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,330
by another guy he's
out at Duke University,

1267
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,320
his name is Diego, excuse me,

1268
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,620
Diego Borges he's a wonderful scientist.

1269
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,050
He has a degree in nutrition,
but also in neuroscience.

1270
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,763
And he found that there are
neurons that line the gut,

1271
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,870
and those neurons in
collaboration with these GPR65

1272
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,830
neurons are sensing
for three things, okay?

1273
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,550
So we say nutrients, which
nutrients are they looking for?

1274
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,420
What are these neurons
paying attention to?

1275
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,410
While these neurons are
activated by the presence

1276
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,790
of fatty acids in particular,
omega-3 fatty acids,

1277
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,300
sorts of things that come
from fatty fish, oil, krill,

1278
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,570
certain kinds of animal protein, animal,

1279
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,410
and plant substances.

1280
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,700
You can look up what has a
lot of omega-3s and those

1281
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,170
omega-3s make these neurons
fire electrically like crazy

1282
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,840
up to the brain and make you
want to eat more of those

1283
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,070
things, but it turns out in
pretty appropriate levels.

1284
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,540
These neurons also respond to amino acids.

1285
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,530
So when you eat a food,
it's broken down in the gut,

1286
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:16,520
actually the way it's
broken down in the gut

1287
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,670
is kind of interesting.

1288
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:20,950
Your gut basically cinches
off a sphincter up top,

1289
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,010
cinches off a sphincter below
it when there's food there.

1290
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,460
And then you have a
series of smooth muscles

1291
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,060
that tumble the food and literally
physically break it down.

1292
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,490
And then of course,

1293
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,930
enzymes come in and
start digesting the food.

1294
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,350
And we're going to talk about digestion

1295
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,290
and how that's communicated
to the brain in a moment.

1296
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,090
And for those of you with any
autoimmune issues or digestive

1297
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,180
issues, this is going to be
very important conversation.

1298
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,770
But meanwhile there are these neurons

1299
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,780
in the gut and as these fatty acids

1300
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,340
float out of the digested food,

1301
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,340
so literally fat molecules,
and as amino acids are coming

1302
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,000
from the proteins as
they're digested in the gut.

1303
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,040
And as a third food item,

1304
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,360
sugars are coming from
the foods that we eat.

1305
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,720
These neurons will fire a lot
to the brain that says, Hey,

1306
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,493
whatever you're doing up
there, do more of it, okay?

1307
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:11,950
Now the sugars are a
little bit cryptic because

1308
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,603
when I say sugars or I say amino acids,

1309
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:19,470
or I say fatty acids, this
has nothing to do with taste.

1310
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,690
In fact, beautiful
experiments have been done

1311
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,030
by the Borges Lab and
by other labs showing

1312
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,930
that even if you numb the mouth,

1313
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,280
even if you gavavge,
which is a really, just a,

1314
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,040
it's a fancy word for
basically tube feeding,

1315
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,170
you put a tube down into the gut,

1316
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,250
you just deliver the food to the gut.

1317
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,490
So you get no opportunity to
taste, it sounds pretty awful.

1318
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:41,100
If you force feed by gavage,
or you numb the mouth,

1319
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,720
these neurons don't care about the mouth.

1320
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,110
They only care about the
nutrients coming from these foods.

1321
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,990
And then they signal to the
brain, hey, do that thing, do

1322
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,940
that thing where you lift
that object, we call a fork

1323
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,480
or a spoon, do that thing
where you drink the milkshake,

1324
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,600
do that thing where you
move your mouth like this,

1325
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,010
not talking, but do that
thing where you swallow.

1326
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,060
So that's how the nutrients
in our gut control us.

1327
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,440
And this is why for people
that experience extreme sugar

1328
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,620
cravings, or even mild sugar cravings,

1329
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,440
replacing those foods with
foods that have high levels

1330
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,250
of omega-3 or amino acids
can produce sugar cravings.

1331
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,690
And I've talked about this
on a previous episode,

1332
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,010
but if you didn't catch it, no big deal.

1333
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,770
I'll tell you right now
that for many people,

1334
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,840
the solution to sugar cravings
is to ingest a small amount,

1335
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,113
maybe a teaspoon or so of an
amino acid called glutamine.

1336
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,690
And if you have really
extreme sugar cravings,

1337
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,040
you can even mix that glutamine
with a full-fat cream,

1338
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,630
which actually makes it
taste pretty darn good.

1339
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,970
And you drink that anytime
you have a sugar craving

1340
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:38,907
or just a sip or two of that.

1341
00:57:38,907 --> 00:57:40,980
And we find is that the
sugar cravings disappear,

1342
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,320
because you're basically
giving fat and amino acids

1343
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,010
to those neurons in the
gut and in the intestine,

1344
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,160
that signal to the brain
that you want more.

1345
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,230
Now, this doesn't give you a kind

1346
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,523
of runaway hunger for full fat cream.

1347
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:55,920
Although it will say when I
was in high school for various

1348
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,570
reasons, but mostly because
I liked the way it tastes.

1349
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,940
I was using half and half in my cereal.

1350
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,610
And I was waking up in the
middle of night and drinking half

1351
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,250
and half, and that stuff
tastes pretty darn good

1352
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,040
once you get used to the high fat content.

1353
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,810
Not something I do now.

1354
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:11,430
But the point is these neurons
don't really know taste,

1355
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,820
they only know nutrients.

1356
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,300
And so you can work with that
system if you crave sugar,

1357
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,640
and I do believe that most if
not all of us should be trying

1358
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,490
to limit, if not eliminate simple sugars,

1359
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,890
as much as possible most of the time,

1360
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:28,890
then things like glutamine,
things like high omega-3 foods,

1361
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,950
et cetera, maybe even want to supplement

1362
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,550
with fish oil or something
similar to get omega-3s,

1363
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,383
there are other reasons

1364
00:58:34,383 --> 00:58:36,510
for wanting to do that too,
can be very beneficial.

1365
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,350
And here's what we're talking
about is interoception,

1366
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,410
it's your ability to sense
your inner real estate,

1367
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,620
but in this case, by way

1368
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,963
of chemical signaling, not by
way of mechanical signaling.

1369
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,130
So now I'd like to talk
about another aspect

1370
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:54,840
of gut chemistry that has profound effects

1371
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,370
on the brain, as well
as on the immune system.

1372
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,780
And for those of you with
auto-immune conditions,

1373
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,260
or for those of you that
know people with auto-immune

1374
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,260
conditions, this is going to
be a very important discussion.

1375
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,800
Your gut needs to maintain
a certain level of acidity

1376
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,540
or alkalinity, for those of
you without any chemistry

1377
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:17,050
background, basically the
low numbers on the pH scale,

1378
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,120
that means more acidic,
the higher, the numbers,

1379
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,620
more alkaline, so more
alkaline means more basic

1380
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,233
and acidic means acidic.

1381
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,600
And it has to do with whom
hydrogen atoms and all this other

1382
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,720
stuff, but you don't need to
worry about that right now.

1383
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,110
We're not going to pH your gut right now,

1384
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,240
but we are going to talk
about the pH of your gut.

1385
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,450
Your gut needs to be more acidic
than essentially all other

1386
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,000
tissues of your body in
order to function properly,

1387
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,490
bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions.

1388
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,180
I think this is important
for people to understand.

1389
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,200
People are always thinking, oh,

1390
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,420
you should be more alkaline being acidic,

1391
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,190
that almost sounds like being
inflamed at well, you know,

1392
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,350
it's a complicated discussion,

1393
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,560
but I think the semantics
can be confusing,

1394
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,750
sometimes you want your gut to be acidic.

1395
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:02,580
You may ask, well, why are
people taking antacids?

1396
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,720
Well, those antacids are
there for a particular purpose

1397
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,710
to essentially combat acid reflux,

1398
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,860
which is the sending up of stuff

1399
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,793
in the gut towards the esophagus.

1400
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,380
And it can cause heartburn
and things of that sort.

1401
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,790
And the way the antacids
work is they essentially

1402
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,480
cause the sphincters above the gut

1403
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,620
to sinch shut, but they
really are only dealing

1404
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,770
with a symptom, not the cause.

1405
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,510
So rewind, and about 10, 20 years ago,

1406
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,510
the discussion about gut acidity
was quite a bit different

1407
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,030
than it is now in the scientific
and medical literature.

1408
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,230
In fact, for many years long before,

1409
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,690
I'm going to say it here,
people have been saying

1410
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,150
that it's important to
maintain proper acidity

1411
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:50,270
of the gut, but the science
and medical professions sort

1412
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,110
of looked at that as kind
of a scance like, you know,

1413
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,070
what's going on there, I don't,

1414
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,780
I don't know that there's any
evidence that that's actually

1415
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,030
true, there are communities of
people that were prescribing,

1416
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,220
or I should say recommending
that people take hydrochloric

1417
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,570
acid HCL and adjusting
gut acidity that way.

1418
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,740
And it was kind of frowned upon,

1419
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,375
now in looking over the
peer reviewed literature,

1420
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,010
it's clear that this business
of trying to make the gut a

1421
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,550
little more acidic is actually one way

1422
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:18,970
in which people treat or try
and ameliorate acid reflux.

1423
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,570
So it's kind of counterintuitive
increasing acidity in the

1424
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,260
gut to try and reduce acid
reflux, thought you're supposed

1425
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,720
to take antacids, well, the
field has shifted quite a bit.

1426
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,870
And so we're going to review
what it is to maintain the

1427
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:34,650
chemistry of the gut at a
slightly more acidic level

1428
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,480
or a more aesthetic level, I should say,

1429
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,340
because it turns out
that there are a number

1430
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,300
of things that are in gut
are just call it what it is,

1431
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,650
it's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross.

1432
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,000
But gastric juices are actually

1433
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,193
powerful modulators of brain state.

1434
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,860
Put differently, one of the best things

1435
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,595
that you can do to have a healthy brain,

1436
01:01:54,595 --> 01:01:55,686
a well-functioning brain

1437
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:57,366
and a healthy and well-functioning body

1438
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,450
is to maintain proper gut chemistry.

1439
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:02,910
And that's basically accomplished
by getting the right level

1440
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,423
of acidity and alkalinity in your gut.

1441
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,420
Now this is not quack pseudoscience.

1442
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,550
This is not based on cleanses
or anything of that sort.

1443
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:14,420
Well, we're going to talk about
now are peer reviewed data

1444
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,830
in very high quality journals,
like the Journal Cell,

1445
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,760
which is one of the three
apex science nature, so,

1446
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,220
and journals of that sort,

1447
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,180
that point to the gut
microbiome and its relationship

1448
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,850
to acidity of the gut and how
the gut microbiome can help

1449
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:32,820
enhance auto-immune function

1450
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,270
and various other aspects
of brain and body health.

1451
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:39,480
So within all the mucosal
lining tissues of our body,

1452
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,220
we have what are called
microbiota, little micro organisms

1453
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,630
that we didn't make that actually come

1454
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:49,630
from our environment or our
food and live inside us.

1455
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:53,490
And there are good microbiota
and there are bad microbiota

1456
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,000
whether or not we have good microbiota

1457
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,180
or bad microbiota depends on one thing.

1458
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,400
And that one thing is how acid or alkaline

1459
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,193
the given mucosal tissue is.

1460
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,740
So we actually have a
microbiome in our nose.

1461
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,280
And just as a very brief aside,

1462
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,900
because I'd be remiss
if I didn't say this,

1463
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,630
if you emphasize nasal breathing most

1464
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,830
of the time, except
when speaking or eating.

1465
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,280
And if you downplay mouth breathing,

1466
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,950
meaning you refrain from mouth breathing,

1467
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:30,950
especially in sleep, you
improve the nasal microbiome.

1468
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,740
It gets better at fighting off infections.

1469
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,170
This was shown in a beautiful paper,

1470
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,640
published in Cell Reports last year.

1471
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,190
And that paper I should mention
was performed in humans.

1472
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,990
So you've got a microbiome in your nose

1473
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,270
and my nasal breathing most
of the time, not all the time.

1474
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,103
Cause there going to be times

1475
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:49,770
when you need to breathe
through your mouth

1476
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,430
for whatever reason, hard exercise

1477
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,380
or eating or speaking, but by
breathing through your nose,

1478
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:57,350
most of the time you are
creating an additional layer of

1479
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:00,660
immune defense against particles
that could get you sick.

1480
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,030
Whereas when you mouth breathe,

1481
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:04,040
you are taking down a layer of defense

1482
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,170
and you are putting yourself
more at risk of infection.

1483
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,670
This is what this paper shows.

1484
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:12,860
You also have a gut microbiome that is

1485
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,360
in your throat, in your
stomach and in your intestines.

1486
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,950
And that gut microbiome
is extremely powerful

1487
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:24,770
in regulating your mood
and your immune function.

1488
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:27,210
Now, this is not something
that you can sense directly.

1489
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,830
You don't know when you have a
bunch of good microbiota or a

1490
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:33,400
bunch of bad microbiota because
you can feel them moving

1491
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,210
around in there, actually
that would be pretty awful,

1492
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,023
that would be pretty creepy feeling.

1493
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,560
Rather that according to whether
or not your gut is alkaline

1494
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,860
or acidic in the appropriate ways,

1495
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,003
you will populate your gut with
the appropriate microbiota.

1496
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:52,960
So you want your stomach
to be pretty acidic,

1497
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,260
but other elements of your digestive tract

1498
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,220
are going to be more pH.

1499
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,930
And basically there's a gradient,

1500
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:03,930
meaning there's a low to high
pH gradient along the gut.

1501
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,770
You don't have to know what the pH

1502
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,140
should be at any one given point,

1503
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,460
because you're not going
to go and put microbiota

1504
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,490
at one location and not another.

1505
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:16,060
What you essentially want to
do is create an environment

1506
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:20,480
where the proper can thrive,
because when you do that,

1507
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,550
you greatly decrease what are
called inflammatory cytokines.

1508
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,970
So these are things that
are secreted both by cells,

1509
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:30,660
within the body and cells
within the brain to impact brain

1510
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,070
health and brain function
and bodily health.

1511
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:36,010
They go by particular name,
so there's something called

1512
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:38,670
TNF alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha.

1513
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,050
It is inflammatory.

1514
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,040
It's not a good thing to
have at elevated levels.

1515
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,950
You have something called
Interleukin Six, IL-6

1516
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,580
also causes inflammation,

1517
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,080
causes damage to tissues,
not a good thing to have

1518
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,263
elevated for long periods of time.

1519
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,450
And then you have
anti-inflammatory cytokines,

1520
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,020
things like Interleukin 10,
which reduce inflammation.

1521
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,650
And there are hundreds of these,

1522
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,880
if not thousands of these
different cytokines,

1523
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,600
some of which promote inflammation,

1524
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,140
some of which reduce inflammation.

1525
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:11,120
The simple way to adjust these
things in the proper ratios

1526
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,070
is to adjust your gut microbiome.

1527
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,120
The best way to adjust your microbiome is

1528
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,570
to ingest certain types of foods.

1529
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,470
So there is a beautiful literature

1530
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:22,070
on this now, but the most
important literature is the one

1531
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:25,280
that I referred to at the
beginning of this episode,

1532
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,100
which is what to ingest
and what not to ingest

1533
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,010
in terms of foods in order
to create the best conditions

1534
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,270
in your gut so that you can
create the best conditions

1535
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,420
in your brain and body.

1536
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,560
There was a study done by my colleague,

1537
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,240
Justin Sonnenberg at
Stanford School of Medicine.

1538
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,660
Justin's actually my upstairs neighbor

1539
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,890
in the building at Stanford where I work

1540
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:51,230
and they explored how different foods

1541
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,800
or different diets, I should say,

1542
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,710
impact the gut microbiome
and inflammatory markers.

1543
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:58,460
And this is a beautiful
study because it was done

1544
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,710
in hundreds of human patients.

1545
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,510
These actually weren't
patients that were sick,

1546
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:06,320
I should say human subjects
that were otherwise healthy

1547
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,180
from a huge variety of
backgrounds, so you had men,

1548
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:10,960
you had women, you had people

1549
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,220
of different races, different ethnicities.

1550
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,690
You had a huge range of backgrounds

1551
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,140
and they tracked all of that.

1552
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,140
And what they did is they
explored two types of diets.

1553
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,180
One is a high fiber diet.

1554
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:25,670
So dietary fibers are
non-digestible are only partially

1555
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,960
digestible carbohydrates typically.

1556
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,660
And they compared that to diets

1557
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:33,420
that were unchanged, except
for the inclusion of a few,

1558
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,680
to a few more servings of
fermented foods, each day,

1559
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,010
things like sauerkraut,
things like kimchi,

1560
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,000
they even explored, it
sounds pretty disgusting

1561
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,230
to me, but who knows, I've never tried it,

1562
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,680
which is fermented cottage cheese.

1563
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,460
And what they found was
that after initial period

1564
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,370
of a few weeks, where they
had people either eat a lot

1565
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:54,700
of fiber or eat one or two
servings of fermented foods,

1566
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,530
they had those people ramp
up their ingestion of either

1567
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,200
fiber or fermented foods, so
they kind of ease them into it.

1568
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,950
As they went baseline then ramp up

1569
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,400
to the point where they
were ingesting, you know,

1570
01:08:05,427 --> 01:08:06,690
four or five servings of fiber or

1571
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,420
of fermented foods per day,
which sounds like a lot.

1572
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,670
But for fermented foods,
that would be, you know,

1573
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:16,170
four or five tablespoons
of sauerkraut or kimchi.

1574
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,737
It's not quite,

1575
01:08:17,737 --> 01:08:20,140
it's not like huge platefuls
of fermented foods.

1576
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,439
And then they looked
at a number of things.

1577
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,759
They looked at the proteome,

1578
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,420
which is a kind of like
looking at the genome,

1579
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,640
but a bunch of proteins
that are made in the body.

1580
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,890
And they did this by fecal
samples, by stool samples,

1581
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:33,020
and they did this by blood
draw, which is great,

1582
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,410
it's a real power of this study.

1583
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:37,620
In fact, the most comprehensive
study that I'm aware of.

1584
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,450
By looking at these different
tissues across long periods

1585
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:44,990
of time, so many weeks, and
then returning people to their,

1586
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:47,410
to the diet that they were
on before they went into the

1587
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:51,430
study, they will were able
to establish in a causal way,

1588
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:55,729
how ingesting fibers or fibrous
foods versus ingesting these

1589
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:58,369
fermented foods on a daily
basis could impact the gut

1590
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:02,190
microbiome and many inflammatory markers

1591
01:09:03,341 --> 01:09:05,611
and many markers of immune function

1592
01:09:05,612 --> 01:09:07,970
and auto immune function.

1593
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,569
And the takeaway message
from this study is that the

1594
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:15,249
fermented foods far out
performed the high fiber diet.

1595
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:18,479
In fact, the high fiber diet
in some people was beneficial

1596
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,329
and in other people caused
issues with inflammation.

1597
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:25,127
This is very different than
what I was taught growing up

1598
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,743
and what many of us were taught.

1599
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,270
Interestingly they also
observed that people

1600
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,960
that ate the high fiber diet

1601
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,620
had increases in certain enzymes

1602
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,899
that lend themselves to better
digestion of carbohydrates.

1603
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:41,349
And I think there's an important
insight to come from this.

1604
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,350
Nowadays we kind of live
in the age of extremes

1605
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,609
where people seem to
either want to be carnivore

1606
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:47,319
or like never ingest a vegetable,

1607
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:49,349
I hear they don't even like allow pepper,

1608
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,620
but they're not even allowed, you know,

1609
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,720
sauerkraut or something like very extreme

1610
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,270
or pure plant based, pure vegan or pure.

1611
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,040
So essentially pure carbohydrate

1612
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,550
or pure animal protein, very extreme.

1613
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,970
I'm an omnivore, I like to eat a mixture

1614
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:06,130
of different things at
different times of days,

1615
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,560
but very extreme, but this is
interesting because what this,

1616
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,350
what these data show is that
perhaps ingesting a high

1617
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:16,040
carbohydrate high fiber diet,
which is really what these,

1618
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,480
the high-fiber condition really was

1619
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,530
actually makes people better
at digesting carbohydrates.

1620
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:23,363
This may explain

1621
01:10:23,363 --> 01:10:27,050
why people who are used to
a, kind of a more paleo type

1622
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,950
or carnivore type diet
might eat carbohydrates

1623
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:32,440
and say, oh, that doesn't work
for me, I don't feel good.

1624
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,070
It might also explain why
people who predominantly eat

1625
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,530
plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods

1626
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:40,090
will try eating meat as an experiment,

1627
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,040
or because they lost a
bet or whatever it is

1628
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,020
and they'll do or desperation,
or they'll do that.

1629
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,800
And then they'll say, oh, I
don't feel good when I eat meat.

1630
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,470
How good you feel,

1631
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:53,100
it seems how well you
can utilize that food,

1632
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,750
and how much of that food
you crave may be determined

1633
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,090
in fact, it appears is determined

1634
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,630
by your food eating history,
the types of food you eat.

1635
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,750
And I think this might
explain some of the divide

1636
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:08,510
and hopefully might bridge
some of the chasm between these

1637
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,240
different groups that are
saying it should be one way,

1638
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,810
or it should be another.

1639
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:15,700
But at the core of the study
was the bigger message.

1640
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:20,320
The bigger message is that
all of us should be ingesting

1641
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,270
on a regular basis, daily basis,

1642
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,280
two to four servings of fermented
foods of different kinds.

1643
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,840
And why I say that is because

1644
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,110
the inflammatory markers went down,

1645
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:35,090
the markers of auto-immune
disruption went down,

1646
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:39,030
and the chemistry of the
gut therefore was adjusted

1647
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,130
in the appropriate ways.

1648
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,260
Now it's not to say that high fiber is bad

1649
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,830
or that fiber is bad, I don't want people

1650
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:46,530
to confuse this, but even
though this is a discussion

1651
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:48,860
about interoception,
about sensing the self.

1652
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:52,740
This is a subconscious
mechanism by which the gut

1653
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:55,650
communicates to many
organs, including the brain.

1654
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,080
And it's been shown in other
studies also in quality peer

1655
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:03,290
review journals that when
the correct gut microbiota

1656
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:07,240
are present and these
inflammatory markers are reduced,

1657
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,650
cognition improves so ability to focus,

1658
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:12,600
ability to sleep ability
to ward off infection

1659
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,510
and wound healing all enhanced,

1660
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,530
in fact, even in autism spectrum disorder,

1661
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,920
in people that struggle with
various mental conditions

1662
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,370
or disorders of the mind
improving the gut microbiome seems

1663
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:28,260
to have powerful effects on
improving brain symptoms.

1664
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,120
Along the lines of auto-immunity,

1665
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,920
there are a number of conditions

1666
01:12:32,984 --> 01:12:36,030
that we call auto-immune conditions,

1667
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,480
and we will do entire episodes
about these going forward.

1668
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:41,100
But for people with so-called
irritable bowel syndrome,

1669
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,570
for people with Crohn's disease,

1670
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:45,240
for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's,

1671
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,270
which is a kind of an
immune system self-attack

1672
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,210
on one's thyroid gland
and things like eczema,

1673
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:55,010
skin conditions, adjusting the
gut microbiome has been shown

1674
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:59,930
to be useful in positively
adjusting the symptoms

1675
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:04,010
of all of those, will it fix
those conditions entirely?

1676
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,903
Probably not.

1677
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,840
But can it have a significant
positive impact on them?

1678
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,943
Probably, yes.

1679
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,420
There is one thing that's worth mentioning

1680
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,350
in that list, which is leaky
gut, what is leaky gut.

1681
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:16,230
Here, we're talking about the guts,

1682
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,890
what is it to have a leaky
gut, it sounds awful.

1683
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,440
It sounds like something sort
of like leaking out the end

1684
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,500
of the tube, and it maybe
that too, I don't know.

1685
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,500
But leaky gut is actually
because, your gut is not a tube

1686
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:30,180
that's continuous, one
cell it's actually made up

1687
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:33,950
of many cells and those
cells form a barrier

1688
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:36,310
and they form what are
called tight junctions.

1689
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:38,870
If you have two cells and you
want to create a fence out

1690
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:40,900
of those cells, you bind them together.

1691
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,160
The way that the body does
this is to bind them together

1692
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,010
with what are called tight
junctions, these are,

1693
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:47,120
they go by names like
claudins and things like that,

1694
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,230
if you want to look them up.

1695
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:50,870
These tight junctions form a nice barrier,

1696
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:53,780
like a cyclone fence, that
things can't get past,

1697
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,970
but like a cyclone fence only
molecules of a certain size

1698
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,635
can go through those holes.

1699
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:00,300
So you're not going to pass a soccer ball

1700
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,220
through an intact cyclone
fence, but you could pass

1701
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,790
for instance, a feather
through that fence.

1702
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:09,790
So leaky gut is when the
conditions in the gut are

1703
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:14,280
too alkaline or the gut
microbiota are off in the gut,

1704
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:19,280
meaning microbiota that like
alkaline guts are living there.

1705
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:23,250
And those tight junctions can't
function at that particular

1706
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,660
pH and you create little
holes in that fence.

1707
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:29,690
And then what happens is
when you ingest foods,

1708
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:32,230
some of those foods
literally leak out of the gut

1709
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,790
and into the extracellular
space and into the bloodstream.

1710
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,900
And because foods include proteins

1711
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,580
and antibodies react to proteins,

1712
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,840
what ends up happening in leaky gut,

1713
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,040
and the reason we talk about
in auto-immune conditions is

1714
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,340
that you start developing antibodies

1715
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,583
to particular food proteins.

1716
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,210
And then people start feeling
like they have food allergies

1717
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:59,240
and they do, they actually
create particular food allergies.

1718
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,730
Now, one way to prevent
leaky gut is to get the rest

1719
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,330
of the gut situation happy
by ingesting the proper foods

1720
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,340
that we talked about before,

1721
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:09,860
ingesting fermented
foods on a regular basis.

1722
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:13,250
The other is our old
friend glutamine, again.

1723
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,270
There are some data and I
should say it's a limited number

1724
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,280
of studies showing that
ingesting glutamine anywhere

1725
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,600
from one to three, excuse
me, teaspoons per day,

1726
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,360
can help alleviate leaky gut.

1727
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,730
Now, the mechanism for that
still isn't clear whether

1728
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:30,863
or not it's adjusting pH or
whether or not it's creating

1729
01:15:30,863 --> 01:15:34,260
more favorable environment
for the microbiota,

1730
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,500
but it is clear that
supplementing with glutamine can,

1731
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,870
in some people enhance where I
should say improve conditions

1732
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,550
of leaky gut, so that
might be useful as well.

1733
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:44,890
And then the final thing about this,

1734
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:47,920
I want to talk about is we're
talking about chemical sensing

1735
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,330
in the gut and how that
impacts wellbeing is about gut

1736
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:56,530
acidity, and this I confess
is a little bit controversial.

1737
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,550
Some people are on board,
this other people are not.

1738
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,850
And so I'd love your feedback
on this, if you, if you agree,

1739
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,170
please tell me if you
disagree, please tell me,

1740
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,833
but please tell me why you
disagree in particular,

1741
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,000
experience or data,
although it's always better

1742
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,460
if you can point me towards
peer reviewed studies.

1743
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,090
There is a practice that
some people embrace.

1744
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,950
I'm not recommending
people necessarily do this.

1745
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,780
And you would definitely
want to talk to your doctor,

1746
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,970
but where people have food
allergies or they're having mood

1747
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:27,250
or auto-immune issues,
and they treat this,

1748
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,400
some people recommend treating this

1749
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,850
through the ingestion of HCL,
hydrochloric acid tablets.

1750
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:35,010
Now hydrochloric acid can burn you, right?

1751
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,500
Acids can burn you, they
literally can melt away skin.

1752
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:43,060
You want to be very careful
with acids of all kinds, truly,

1753
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,910
but hydrochloric acid is sold

1754
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:48,660
as in supplement form
in capsule or pill form.

1755
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:52,050
And there is a practice
of starting to ingest one

1756
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:55,500
or two hydrochloric acid
tablets midway through a meal

1757
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,330
and then what people will
generally do is examine to see

1758
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:02,610
whether or not that improves
their symptoms of indigestion,

1759
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:05,700
how it relates to mood, how
it relates to well-being,

1760
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,240
how it relates to their
sensation of their gut viscera.

1761
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,490
By changing the acidity,
you also changed the way

1762
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,940
that the gut communicates with the brain

1763
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,770
through the mechanisms
we talked about before.

1764
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:16,540
And there are a growing number
of people embracing these

1765
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,640
practices of taking HCL.

1766
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,060
It's often combined with other
things, it's usually combined

1767
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:28,060
with an enzyme and that enzyme is pepsin.

1768
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,838
So most of these
supplements come in the form

1769
01:17:31,838 --> 01:17:36,770
betaine HCL pepsin and while
they're not a cure-all,

1770
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:38,630
and certainly don't want to
suggest that they're a cure-all,

1771
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:42,150
many people that have a hard
time adjusting the pH of

1772
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,650
their gut and have a hard time
adjusting the microbiota of

1773
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:49,090
their gut in the appropriate
ways have benefited from taking

1774
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:53,940
these betaine HCL pepsin tablets
or capsules during meals.

1775
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:55,810
And the general instruction is

1776
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:57,700
to start slow, to start with one or two,

1777
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,840
and then to find a level
that you're comfortable with

1778
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,380
that doesn't create an
excessive feeling of warmth

1779
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:05,190
in the stomach, it doesn't
throw off your digestion.

1780
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,140
So it takes a little bit
of experimentation, again,

1781
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,520
definitely talk to your
healthcare provider

1782
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,703
before exploring this,

1783
01:18:12,425 --> 01:18:14,590
but this has become a very
common practice for people with

1784
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:19,590
auto-immune disorders and
accessing the gut because it is

1785
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,540
accessible by taking things
has also become way in which

1786
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,920
people with various mental
conditions are trying to adjust

1787
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,440
their mood and adjust their wellbeing.

1788
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,580
Along these lines,

1789
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,220
I do want to mention that
there are studies that show

1790
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:37,870
that people that supplement
with a lot of probiotics

1791
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:41,700
or even prebiotics can
sometimes experience brain fog.

1792
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,050
This isn't discussed a lot

1793
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:45,300
and the data are a little
all over the place,

1794
01:18:46,685 --> 01:18:48,266
but it is that we're thinking about.

1795
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:51,045
The goal here is not to
create as many microbiota

1796
01:18:51,045 --> 01:18:54,933
as possible, what you want
is microbiota diversity.

1797
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:56,830
And I should mention this again

1798
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,430
in reference to the Sonnenberg study,

1799
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,620
which was what the high fiber diet does

1800
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,160
is it increases certain microbiota,

1801
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,480
but it limits their diversity

1802
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,750
and what the fermented food diet does,

1803
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,700
or I should say the diet that
includes regular ingestion

1804
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,129
of fermented foods a few servings a day

1805
01:19:15,129 --> 01:19:19,200
is it increases microbiota diversity.

1806
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,193
Now, lack of microbiota diversity

1807
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:23,810
has a name in the medical profession.

1808
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,600
It's called dysbiosis
and dysbiosis is bad.

1809
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,870
Dysbiosis is what you see
when people are spending long

1810
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,910
periods of time on bedrest

1811
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,620
or when they've been chronically
ill, and so here again,

1812
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:39,150
we're talking about creating
a positive environment

1813
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,990
in the gut, either by adjusting acidity,

1814
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,930
maybe you explore the
betaine HCL pepsin thing.

1815
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:45,570
I think if you have healthy digestion,

1816
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:48,710
if you feel like you
have a good relationship

1817
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,580
to your gut, and it has a
good relationship to you,

1818
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,463
sort of a silly phrase, because
it is you and you are it,

1819
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:57,800
then I don't think there's
any need to pursue this,

1820
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,648
but if you don't, that might
be one avenue to pursue.

1821
01:20:00,648 --> 01:20:02,690
However I think primary in all

1822
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:04,890
of this is the fermented food findings,

1823
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:08,030
and it's not just one study,
it's many many findings

1824
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,150
that now bring us to a place where a huge

1825
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:12,380
center of massive data are
pointing us in the direction

1826
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:16,510
of saying ingest fermented
foods on a regular basis.

1827
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:20,190
I should also mention that
conditions like sarcopenia,

1828
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,020
which is the loss of
muscle tissue as we age,

1829
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:26,750
has been shown to be offset by
improving the gut microbiota.

1830
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,860
So while today is

1831
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,140
about interoception, we're
talking about sensing,

1832
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,260
we're also talking about
subconscious sensing.

1833
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,840
What are we talking about,
subconscious sensing,

1834
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,870
we're talking about subconscious sensing

1835
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:37,450
of the milieu of the body.

1836
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:40,740
When the milieu of the
gut and the body is right,

1837
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,620
than the brain and the immune
system function very well.

1838
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,630
And so this isn't something
where you can sit back

1839
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:49,360
and say, oh, you know, I feel
all those good microbiota

1840
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,480
in my gut, or, oh, no,
those are bad microbiota.

1841
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,930
You can't do that unless you're
going to take fecal samples

1842
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,750
and blood samples and analyze them

1843
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:01,130
in the, with the extreme exhaustive nature

1844
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,280
that the Sonnenberg and other labs do,

1845
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,760
you're not going to get
that kind of information.

1846
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,470
I know there are companies out there

1847
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,810
that do this, and I don't
want to knock on any

1848
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:13,010
of them, but I do want to
emphasize that to do this right,

1849
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:15,700
to really analyze which
cytokines you're making,

1850
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,640
which ones you're not,

1851
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,440
you really need to look
at a huge number of them.

1852
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,560
And that requires large-scale proteomic

1853
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:25,010
and genomic and inflammatory
markers screens.

1854
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,520
It's just not the kind of
thing that most commercial

1855
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,940
enterprises can really provide

1856
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,560
to people in a way that
they can interpret, rather,

1857
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,860
this is a case where you can
simply go to the effector,

1858
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,590
to the thing that can
actually move the needle

1859
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,710
in the right direction for you.

1860
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,460
It's very clear that's fermented
foods and that's keeping

1861
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,710
the stomach slightly more acid

1862
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:44,070
than one might think you would want to.

1863
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,470
So let's talk about barfing first.

1864
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:51,470
Barfing, AKA vomiting, is when
the contents of your guts run

1865
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,888
in reverse, meaning when
they go up from your stomach.

1866
01:21:54,888 --> 01:21:56,696
Sometimes even up from the intestines,

1867
01:21:56,696 --> 01:21:58,330
even though that sounds horrible,

1868
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:02,000
it sometimes happens up,
out the esophagus and mouth

1869
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:06,093
and onto whatever surface
happens to be in front of you.

1870
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,500
It's a terrible thing,
nobody likes to do it,

1871
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,960
but it's a very interesting
aspect of our biology because it

1872
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,700
reveals a beautiful and absolutely
fundamental relationship

1873
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,890
between our chemistry and our brain.

1874
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:25,680
So your brain is actually
locked behind a gate

1875
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,170
and that gate is not your skull.

1876
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,230
That gate is the so-called
blood-brain barrier.

1877
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:34,307
So just like your gut has these
epithelial tight junctions,

1878
01:22:34,307 --> 01:22:36,770
the things I talked about
before that provide a fence,

1879
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:40,880
so things can't get through
and get through in leaky gut,

1880
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,860
your brain has tight
junctions that are very tight.

1881
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,910
It's absolutely fundamental
that only certain molecules get

1882
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:52,430
across the blood brain
barrier and that others don't.

1883
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:57,397
And the reason for that is
that most all 99.99999% of your

1884
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,870
neurons do not regenerate, I
don't care what you've read,

1885
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:04,210
especially in the news recently
about how psychedelics cause

1886
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:07,680
neurogenesis, because they
don't, it's absolutely wrong.

1887
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,810
Psychedelics have effects

1888
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:10,400
on brain plasticity, but they have nothing

1889
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,520
to do with neurogenesis, at least no data

1890
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,780
to support it, but because
you can't make new neurons,

1891
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,090
you also can't damage the ones you've got,

1892
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,860
or you shouldn't as much as possible.

1893
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:25,120
And that's why you have a
blood brain barrier or a BBB.

1894
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:30,120
So the BBB as it's called
prevents substances

1895
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:35,430
from getting to the brain,
however, like any fence,

1896
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,490
it is not always uniform along its length.

1897
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:43,820
And there are little spots
within that fence where chemicals

1898
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:47,960
can sneak across to the
brain and through a beautiful

1899
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,720
design, I don't know
anything about the design.

1900
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,680
As I always say, I wasn't
consulted the design phase.

1901
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,100
I'm not talking about any
kind of intelligent design

1902
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,963
or anything that is not
the topic of this podcast.

1903
01:23:56,963 --> 01:23:58,950
This is not a philosophy podcast,

1904
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:01,960
nor is it a religion podcast,
it's a science podcast,

1905
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,460
but through a beautiful design

1906
01:24:04,313 --> 01:24:08,490
of some sort, there are
little holes in that fence.

1907
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:12,110
And they're little neurons that
sit right behind those holes

1908
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:17,110
and those neurons sense what
the chemistry of the blood is.

1909
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,370
So I'm guessing you probably
didn't imagine that today's

1910
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,529
discussion about sensing the self

1911
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:23,520
would be sensing your
own blood, but you do.

1912
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,530
There's a little area of your
brain, that's little indeed,

1913
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:29,810
but is very important called area postrema

1914
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:32,800
P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A.

1915
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,660
And area postrema is an
area of the brainstem

1916
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,810
that sits right next to another brain area

1917
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:41,940
called the chemo receptor trigger zone.

1918
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,110
And when the contents in your bloodstream

1919
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:48,350
are of a particular kind,

1920
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,953
meaning when there are
pathogens or it's too acidic,

1921
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,210
the neurons and area postrema the neurons

1922
01:24:56,210 --> 01:25:00,690
in the chemo receptor trigger
zone, the CTZ as it's called,

1923
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:05,660
trigger a bunch of motor
reflexes in the abdominal wall

1924
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:09,030
that make you barf.

1925
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:13,040
Okay, the feeling that you
need to throw up is triggered

1926
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,330
by these neurons in the brain stem.

1927
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:16,280
And those neurons in the
brainstem are triggered

1928
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,440
by the presence of certain chemicals.

1929
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,130
And the reason why you don't
have any blood brain barrier at

1930
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:23,970
that location is because
post-trauma has to be there

1931
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,340
like a crossing guard,

1932
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:28,090
making sure that everything
that's coming through the blood

1933
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:31,610
is okay, and if it even
senses just the tiniest bit,

1934
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:35,220
that things are off, it's
going to trigger that reflex.

1935
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,630
Now, the really interesting thing is

1936
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:40,620
that the neurons and area
postrema respond to the chemistry

1937
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,370
of the blood, but they also will respond

1938
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:45,980
to our consciousness,
to things that we think

1939
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,610
and things that we believe
and even particular memories.

1940
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:53,110
This is why when certain people see vomit

1941
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,530
or see someone else vomit, or
even somebody else heaving,

1942
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:57,970
as if they're going to vomit,

1943
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:00,500
they themselves feel as
if they're going to vomit.

1944
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,040
I'm guessing they're probably
even a few of you right now

1945
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,870
that feel like you might vomit.

1946
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:07,550
You might feel salivation in your throat,

1947
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,550
which is always a precursor to vomiting.

1948
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:13,320
Some people, the memory of,

1949
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,500
or the thought of something
like blood or vomit or,

1950
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:20,540
use your imagination, can
actually trigger the vomit reflex.

1951
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:24,880
And that's because these neurons
in area are very sensitive

1952
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,490
to prior experience of
interactions with negative things.

1953
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:31,140
So and actually, as I'm saying this,

1954
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,770
I feel my gut kind of
cramping up again, I'm not,

1955
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:36,427
I don't vomit very easily, I'm not one

1956
01:26:36,427 --> 01:26:39,563
of those, nor am I somebody
who's never vomited.

1957
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:42,730
And here we are talking
about my vomit history,

1958
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:44,700
but I think it's appropriate

1959
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,000
in this, in this context,
the neurons of area,

1960
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:51,960
or they're basically to keep
your whole system safe and

1961
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,420
thank goodness they are, because
for instance, some people,

1962
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,008
unfortunately, they drink so much alcohol

1963
01:26:58,008 --> 01:26:59,300
that they throw up.

1964
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,600
Have you ever wondered why that is?

1965
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,190
Well it's because alcohol
fundamentally is a poison.

1966
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,650
I'm not saying for, you know,

1967
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:08,520
age appropriate folks that
ingesting alcohol is bad.

1968
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,910
This isn't a judgment call,

1969
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:13,110
but alcohol itself at excessive levels

1970
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:17,470
in the bloodstream triggers
post-trauma to cause vomiting.

1971
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:22,373
So this is an example,
whereby memories, context,

1972
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:25,580
but also just the chemistry
of our internal state

1973
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,130
is triggering behaviors
that are very hardwired.

1974
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:30,460
They're very reflux driven.

1975
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:33,760
And why would it be that
some people get more nauseous

1976
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,250
than others at a given level, well,

1977
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,120
they'll have to do with alcohol tolerance.

1978
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,110
Some people have what's
called a, you know,

1979
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:42,610
we refer to as a stronger
stomach or a stomach of steel.

1980
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:45,270
Other people they throw out very easily

1981
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,910
if they don't feel well,
or if they ingest anything

1982
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:49,360
that's just a little bit off.

1983
01:27:50,677 --> 01:27:52,830
From a purely adaptive standpoint,

1984
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:55,172
it's probably better to vomit up things

1985
01:27:55,172 --> 01:27:56,380
that aren't good for you

1986
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,890
rather than to have them
pass through your system.

1987
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:02,610
Especially if those things
are contained in lipids.

1988
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,110
For instance if you ingest something

1989
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:06,120
that's in liquid form because cells,

1990
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,080
literally every cell in
your body is surrounded

1991
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,870
by a little thin layer
of fatty tissue, we call

1992
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:13,960
the bilayer membrane,
it's a little membrane.

1993
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,470
Fat can move through fat very easily.

1994
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:18,640
And so any bad stuff you ingest

1995
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,510
can get stuck in your system.

1996
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:22,654
So let's talk for a second about

1997
01:28:22,654 --> 01:28:25,930
how to reduce nausea, because
nausea is that salivation,

1998
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:28,450
that feeling that you're
going to vomit, can be very

1999
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:31,600
beneficial in an, in an
adaptive circumstance.

2000
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,810
Like you've ingested something bad,

2001
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:36,130
but some people experience
nausea, for other reasons,

2002
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:39,040
there are good ways to regulate nausea

2003
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,820
and the ways they regulate
nausea, very interesting.

2004
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,940
They actually adjust the activity

2005
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,400
of these neurons in area postrema

2006
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,660
or they change the chemistry
of the blood directly.

2007
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,340
And many of you have heard
this before, perhaps,

2008
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,530
but it turns out that there are good data,

2009
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:57,270
11 research studies where the
ones that I could find peer

2010
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:59,310
reviewed research studies with no bias,

2011
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,520
so independent studies showing that ginger

2012
01:29:03,035 --> 01:29:06,200
can cause a notable reduction in nausea,

2013
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,210
how much ginger, one to three grams,

2014
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,910
what's one to three grams where
you have to measure it out

2015
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:12,250
on a scale, unless you're taking
it in pill or capsule form.

2016
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,540
It doesn't seem to matter if you take it

2017
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:16,540
in pill or capsule form, so
this thing that you've heard

2018
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:20,283
before that ginger can reduce
nausea, indeed is true.

2019
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,530
Peppermint, apparently can also do that.

2020
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:28,010
And some of you will not be
surprised to learn that cannabis

2021
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:30,630
can reduce nausea, not
surprise because cannabis,

2022
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,870
which has different legality
in different places,

2023
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,425
and I understand that,

2024
01:29:34,425 --> 01:29:35,970
so please take that into consideration.

2025
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,565
But cannabis, THC and, or it turns out CBD

2026
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:41,460
can reduce nausea,

2027
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,060
that's been shown in at least one study.

2028
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:47,700
And it probably does that,
not by changing the chemistry

2029
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,700
of your blood, but by
changing the threshold

2030
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,400
for firing of these neurons
in area post-trauma.

2031
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,350
And there are conditions
such as in chemotherapy and

2032
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:59,510
radiation therapy and others
where people are feeling very

2033
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:02,150
nauseous, I'm not recommending
people go use cannabis,

2034
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:05,490
unless they've decided with their selves

2035
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:07,520
and their family and their
doctor that they should.

2036
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,370
But what's interesting
is this thing about CBD

2037
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:12,660
and we'll do a whole episode
on THC and CBD doesn't have,

2038
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:15,100
or isn't supposed to have
these psychoactive properties

2039
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,163
that THC does.

2040
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,890
Although CBD can have a
mild to major anxiolytic

2041
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,510
anxiety-reducing effect,

2042
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:25,960
but it does appear that the
data are what the data support.

2043
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:29,660
I should say, the anecdotal reports,

2044
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:33,440
which are that cannabis can reduce nausea.

2045
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,530
So to barf less, ginger, peppermint,

2046
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:40,040
and if appropriate and legal
for you, possibly cannabis.

2047
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,593
Now let's talk about fever.

2048
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:45,560
In previous episodes,
and in future episodes,

2049
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,420
we deal with thermal regulation,

2050
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:50,890
which is the body's ability
to regulate its temperature.

2051
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,430
Talk about cold and heat

2052
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:55,383
and saunas and ice baths
and physical performance.

2053
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:58,400
We're not going to deal
with all that right now,

2054
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,060
but I promise we will going forward.

2055
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,370
Today, I only want to talk about fever

2056
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:07,360
because fever directly
relates to interoception.

2057
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,880
What do I mean by that?

2058
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,180
Well, a fever is simply an
increase in body temperature,

2059
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,080
that increase in body
temperature is triggered

2060
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,280
by neurons in the brain.

2061
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,280
And those neurons in
the brain are triggered

2062
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,193
by the presence of particular
things in the bloodstream.

2063
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:23,883
What sorts of things?

2064
01:31:25,575 --> 01:31:28,210
Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses,

2065
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:30,640
when something bad gets in our system,

2066
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,740
the body doesn't know it's bad,
it just knows it's foreign,

2067
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,500
and it hasn't seen it before.

2068
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,140
Or that it's in the wrong
compartment of the body.

2069
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,570
So earlier we were talking about proteins

2070
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,790
that leak out of the gut
and get elsewhere, you know,

2071
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:45,260
you don't want a piece of
steak sitting in your bicep.

2072
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,090
That would be bad, you would
actually develop antibodies,

2073
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:48,980
you would have a horrible infection.

2074
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,600
But your body has this intelligence,

2075
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,800
and that intelligence is to know, Hmm,

2076
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,540
these proteins are normally
not seen in this region

2077
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:59,030
and then your body or the
cells there, I should say,

2078
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:02,820
we'll release something that
then will travel to the brain

2079
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:05,700
and will trigger an increase
in body temperature so that

2080
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,100
your body cooks the bad thing
or the cause of the bad thing.

2081
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,120
It's really a beautiful
adaptive mechanism.

2082
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,530
We always think fever is so terrible,

2083
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:16,280
but fever is there to cook the
bad thing that's inside you,

2084
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,880
or that has left the correct
compartment inside you

2085
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,730
and is in the wrong
compartment inside you.

2086
01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:26,570
So what's beautiful about
the fever mechanism is

2087
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:28,990
that it looks a lot like
the barfing mechanism.

2088
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:32,040
Basically you have a set of
neurons that sit near the

2089
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:35,730
ventricles, remember the
ventrals is hole in the tube,

2090
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:39,010
that is you, the tube
that is, you are a tube,

2091
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,110
a series of tubes.

2092
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:42,250
And your brain has a hole down the middle.

2093
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,610
And it extends down to the
bottom of your spinal cord,

2094
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,800
at the front, it's called the ventricles,

2095
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,650
they start with what are
called the lateral ventricles

2096
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:49,830
and the excuse me,

2097
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:52,250
starts with the third and
the lateral ventricles,

2098
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,660
and then it goes to the fourth ventricle

2099
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,010
and then to what's
called the central canal.

2100
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:57,080
But basically is just a
big space in the middle

2101
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,920
of your nervous system in
the middle of your brain.

2102
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,380
And you have one ventricle

2103
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:02,480
that I already mentioned
called the third ventricle.

2104
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:06,600
And it's shaped kind of
like a thin oval up upright,

2105
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,320
if you're listening to
this, just think an I,

2106
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:12,960
the shape of an I, but it's
kind of rotated 90 degrees.

2107
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,473
So it's up and down as opposed to across.

2108
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,260
And along that third ventricle,

2109
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,250
there's there a little
neurons that can sense what's

2110
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,750
in the cerebral spinal fluid
that fills the ventricle.

2111
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,650
So in other words,

2112
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,020
you have neurons that
are sensing the chemistry

2113
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,530
of your cerebral spinal fluid,

2114
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:33,410
and that have access therefore

2115
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,823
to the chemistry of your body.

2116
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,570
Because that cerebral
spinal fluid is going up

2117
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:40,320
and down the brain and spinal cord.

2118
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:43,270
But into that cerebral
spinal fluid are signals

2119
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:44,860
about the various
chemicals within the body.

2120
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,930
So this is not a mechanical system.

2121
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,670
This is a chemical system.

2122
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,650
Remember we're talking
about mechanical information

2123
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,600
and chemical information
accessing the brain.

2124
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,740
So if you have something bad

2125
01:33:56,740 --> 01:33:58,440
in your system, you've ingested a,

2126
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,870
you breathe in a virus or
you inhaled some bacteria,

2127
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,630
or you got a cut on your leg

2128
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:05,653
and some bacteria are growing there.

2129
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:09,440
Of course, locally, there will be effects,

2130
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,190
little things called the mast cell.

2131
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:14,460
This M-A-S-T little packets
of histamine literally

2132
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:17,930
will go there and explode
[poofs] and cause inflammation,

2133
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:19,490
which is actually a good inflammation.

2134
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:21,638
And we'll release little things

2135
01:34:21,638 --> 01:34:23,750
called macrophages to
gobble up the infection.

2136
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:26,103
The other day, it was
in Texas, it was some

2137
01:34:26,103 --> 01:34:28,030
mean little mosquitoes in
Texas, and a lot of them,

2138
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,960
and I would stand outside
and I'd get bitten,

2139
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,950
I didn't feel a thing,
but then later that night,

2140
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,600
they started swelling up and itching

2141
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,790
and then I'd itch them, and
then they'd swell even more.

2142
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:38,992
That was because of the release

2143
01:34:38,992 --> 01:34:40,967
of mass cells, of histamines
inside those mass cells

2144
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,620
that would literally causing
inflammation of the tissue.

2145
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:45,960
It wasn't the poison
from the mosquito itself.

2146
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,410
It was the immune response to those.

2147
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:51,670
Well, you also have this systemic

2148
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:55,990
or body-wide attempt to kill
stuff, and that's the fever.

2149
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,990
So the neurons that these
ventricles with cerebral spinal

2150
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:01,680
fluid go by a particular
name, they're called

2151
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:05,620
circumventricular organs,
meaning near circum,

2152
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,490
ventricular near the ventricles.

2153
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:09,670
And you have these organs
and there are a set

2154
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:12,470
of neurons, has a really
cool name called the OVLT.

2155
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:13,800
I don't know why I like
that, but I just like it,

2156
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,650
it's the organum vasculosum
of the lateral terminalis

2157
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:21,830
organum vasculosum of the
lateral terminalis, OVLT

2158
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:25,420
are the neurons that respond to toxins

2159
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,990
and bad stuff in your bloodstream,
however minor or major.

2160
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:31,863
And they release things like ILK-1,

2161
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:36,390
which are inflammatory cytokines
inflammatory in this case

2162
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:39,870
is good, you want inflammation
at the site of an infection.

2163
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,340
It's a good thing.

2164
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,230
It's going to help with healing.

2165
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:46,270
And it's going to change
the conditions in your body,

2166
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:47,720
what's going to happen is

2167
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,900
when those OVLT neurons are activated,

2168
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,550
because you have
something bad in your body

2169
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,740
or something bad is
happening in your body,

2170
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,630
they communicate with an
area of the brain called the

2171
01:35:56,630 --> 01:36:00,010
preoptic area of your
hypothalamus and the preoptic area

2172
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:03,203
cranks up your temperature and
tries to cook that bad thing.

2173
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,730
Now it's worth talking about fever

2174
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:08,940
for a moment and talking
about thermal regulation,

2175
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:12,200
because I think this actually
could save some lives.

2176
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:17,200
So if you are overheated
to a point where, you know,

2177
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,960
you're getting up past 102

2178
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,860
or 103, it's going to vary depending

2179
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:24,230
on person to person and
certainly age, you know, kids,

2180
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:25,990
some people think can
tolerate higher levels

2181
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,510
of fever than adults, but look,

2182
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:29,690
you always want to be cautious
about heating up the brain

2183
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,350
too much, because once
those neurons are gone,

2184
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:33,680
they do not come back and
neurons do not do well

2185
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,370
in very high temperatures.

2186
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:37,570
Once your body temperature
starts getting up

2187
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:41,110
to 102, 103, certainly 104,

2188
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:43,500
you are starting to enter
serious danger zone.

2189
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,570
This can happen through
exercise in hot environments

2190
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:49,250
or an inability to escape heat

2191
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,251
because you don't have covering

2192
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:53,570
or adequate ventilation or cooling.

2193
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:55,670
It can also be because of excessive fever,

2194
01:36:55,670 --> 01:36:56,970
for whatever reason.

2195
01:36:56,970 --> 01:36:59,750
A lot of people think the way
to deal with this is to put a

2196
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:04,343
cool compress on the back of
the neck or to cool the torso.

2197
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,170
In discussing this with
my colleague, Craig Heller

2198
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:10,690
who's at Stanford School of Medicine,

2199
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:12,680
and he's on the undergraduate side

2200
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,900
of the campus as well, runs a biology lab.

2201
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,360
He's a world expert in thermal regulation.

2202
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:20,270
It's very clear that
that's the wrong response

2203
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:21,733
to try and cool off the body.

2204
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,770
If you put a cold towel
or you put an ice pack

2205
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:29,340
on the back of the neck, what
you effectively do is cool

2206
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,310
the blood that's going to the brain.

2207
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:33,030
And if you do that,

2208
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:36,980
then your brain will react
by turning up the crank

2209
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:40,550
in so to speak on the neurons
in the pre optic area,

2210
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:43,100
and will heat you up further
and can cook your brain

2211
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,740
and organs further.

2212
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:46,760
So what you want to do is, as I've talked

2213
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:50,540
about before, you want to
cool the bottoms of the feet,

2214
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,660
the palms of the hands and
the upper part of the face.

2215
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,480
And I'm not going to
go into all the details

2216
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,140
as to why you want to do that right now,

2217
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:58,820
but those are the
locations you want to cool.

2218
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,890
Now you can also cool
the rest of the body,

2219
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:03,290
but it's not okay to just
stay under the covers

2220
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:06,380
and just cool, you know, the
neck or something like that.

2221
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:09,220
You really want to try
and create a systemic

2222
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:12,160
or whole body cooling, if the
goal is to bring fever down,

2223
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,100
but in many cases, fever is adaptive.

2224
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,800
And so taking a non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs

2225
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,230
like Advil and Tylenol

2226
01:38:20,230 --> 01:38:22,610
sometimes can be good,
if that's recommended,

2227
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:24,590
but other times, because
it reduces your fever,

2228
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:26,980
it's allowing that pathogen,

2229
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:29,520
that pyrogen, it's sometimes called,

2230
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,950
a pyrogen is a substance
that causes fever,

2231
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:35,553
think pyro, think fire, think
pyromaniacs, think pyro,

2232
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:40,440
those pyrogens can survive at
moderate to low temperatures,

2233
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,880
and they can't survive
at high temperatures.

2234
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,457
So the fever is an adaptive
mechanism and the OVLT,

2235
01:38:44,457 --> 01:38:48,780
and the sensing of your
chemistry is how the OVLT,

2236
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,640
organum vasculosum of the
lateral terminalis does that.

2237
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:55,250
So we've talked about sensing lung volume,

2238
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,433
speed of our heartbeat,

2239
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:59,250
we talked about sensing the gut volume,

2240
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:01,560
the intestinal volume,
or the absence of volume.

2241
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:06,560
We talked about chemistry of
the gut and the gut microbiota

2242
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:08,400
and auto immune functions.

2243
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,760
And we've now talked about
vomiting, and we've talked

2244
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:16,160
about fever, lots of aspects
of sensing our internal self.

2245
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,090
Now I want to turn our attention

2246
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:22,270
to interoception as it
relates to feelings,

2247
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:25,350
the way that interoception
is most commonly described.

2248
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,370
And I want to highlight a term that many

2249
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,850
of you have probably heard,
which is the vagus nerve.

2250
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:31,520
We talked about vagus
a little bit earlier,

2251
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,383
but the vagus nerve, this
vagabonding wandering nerve

2252
01:39:35,383 --> 01:39:39,680
is involved in everything I've
talked about up until now.

2253
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,760
And the reason I saved it till now,

2254
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,840
rather than mentioning all
along is to highlight a specific

2255
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,510
point, which is that whenever
we hear about the vagus

2256
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:50,050
in popular culture, it's like
the vagus calms you down,

2257
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:51,640
you want to stimulate the vagus by rubbing

2258
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,080
in front of the ear, and
it's a parasympathetic nerve,

2259
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,690
and it will calm you down,
he'll mellow you out.

2260
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:59,760
Actually, most of the time,
the vagus is stimulatory.

2261
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,010
When you ingest foods
with amino acids, sugars,

2262
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,320
or fatty acids,

2263
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,886
the vagus nerve gets activated

2264
01:40:06,886 --> 01:40:08,903
and triggers the release of dopamine,

2265
01:40:09,832 --> 01:40:11,010
it makes you more alert and go seek more

2266
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:13,703
of those foods or what
led to those conditions.

2267
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,727
When you feel nauseous
it's rarely calming,

2268
01:40:16,727 --> 01:40:20,140
when you feel like you have
a fever, it's rarely calming.

2269
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,790
So you're starting to
get the picture that even

2270
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:25,805
though the vagus nerve is in
the parasympathetic branch

2271
01:40:25,805 --> 01:40:27,550
of the autonomic nervous system.

2272
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:28,740
And if that doesn't mean anything to you,

2273
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:31,000
because you're not in
aficionado, don't worry about it.

2274
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,350
But it's not a calming system,
it's a communication system,

2275
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:36,530
and it's a motor system.

2276
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,830
It communicates brain to
body and body to brain,

2277
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:41,943
and it changes the function
of different organs, now,

2278
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:47,240
one thing that's important
to highlight is that stress

2279
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:51,600
itself will alter the
chemistry of your gut

2280
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,910
because of the ways that
it down the vagus nerve

2281
01:40:55,775 --> 01:40:58,170
and quiets the neurons that
communicate from gut to brain.

2282
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:59,290
I want to say that again,

2283
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:01,130
stress will disrupt your gut

2284
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:04,878
and make you feel not
good, poor digestion,

2285
01:41:04,878 --> 01:41:07,890
and just lousy, because
of the way that it shuts

2286
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:10,730
down the vagus nerve and
the neurons of your gut.

2287
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:13,930
So what stress does is it
blocks the communication

2288
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:16,770
between gut and brain, it
doesn't mess up your gut.

2289
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:18,920
It just doesn't let your
gut get the signals up

2290
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:22,460
to your brain, and it also
then throws off the chemistry.

2291
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,220
And then there's a whole
cascade of effects.

2292
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,500
If you want to learn more about stress,

2293
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,840
I did a whole episode
called "Master Stress,"

2294
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,977
or I think maybe it was
called "Conquer Stress"

2295
01:41:28,977 --> 01:41:31,340
and it was "Master Stress," either one.

2296
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,230
The whole point of that
episode is to give you tools

2297
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:36,230
and practices to deal with
short term, acute stress,

2298
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:39,003
moderate term stress, and
long-term chronic stress

2299
01:41:39,003 --> 01:41:40,870
through behavioral mechanisms,

2300
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:45,140
nutrition, supplementation,
and many other things as well.

2301
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,023
It's chockablock full of
protocols and tools for stress.

2302
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:51,580
The vagus nerve, however,

2303
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:55,350
is responsible for emotion
and the way it does that

2304
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:59,690
is to pool, to aggregate the conditions

2305
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:02,000
of your gut, the conditions of your heart

2306
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,930
and the conditions of your breathing,

2307
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:07,480
which includes your diaphragm
and lungs and takes that kind

2308
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:11,490
of as a collection of
information and sends it

2309
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:14,873
to the brain and controls
what we call your emotions.

2310
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:19,070
Now that might seem
obvious to some people,

2311
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:21,600
but to other people that
might seem totally crazy.

2312
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,370
You thought your emotions were
because the market was down

2313
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:25,730
and you had invested,

2314
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:27,720
or because something that
you thought was going

2315
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,970
to happen is not going to happen,

2316
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:33,160
or because you thought
that school was open

2317
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,420
and then it's not, or
maybe thought it wasn't,

2318
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,810
and it is whatever it is that bothers you,

2319
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:41,340
you think of generally as
a purely cognitive event.

2320
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,930
But the brain doesn't really know

2321
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:45,780
what to do with that information.

2322
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,950
It doesn't act directly on that
information to create moods.

2323
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:52,450
Moods are created through
the heart's response

2324
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:55,870
to reading that headline, to
the change in your breathing,

2325
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:58,860
that's caused by someone
that you love telling you

2326
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:00,530
that actually they're not interested

2327
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:02,565
in spending time with you anymore,

2328
01:43:02,565 --> 01:43:04,634
or that you screwed up or
that they're interested in

2329
01:43:04,634 --> 01:43:06,750
spending a lot of time with
you and you like that, right?

2330
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:09,510
Emotions can be good or bad or neutral.

2331
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:12,750
So this thing that we call interoception,

2332
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,580
the sense of self I've been building up

2333
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:17,770
from very fundamental
layers, gut chemistry,

2334
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:21,290
spleens, immune systems,
auto-immune and you might've been

2335
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:23,050
thinking, wait, I thought this was going

2336
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:26,530
to be about a sense of self,
a noticing or a feeling.

2337
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:30,270
And indeed all of those things
are plugging in like a series

2338
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,870
of ingredients in a recipe that gives rise

2339
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:35,350
to your mood and how you feel,

2340
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:40,150
and that mood and how you feel is shown

2341
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:43,350
in one location in your body
that other people can see.

2342
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:45,830
And that's in your facial expressions.

2343
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:49,613
And indeed there are now
beautiful data showing

2344
01:43:49,613 --> 01:43:53,920
that your face, including
the size of your pupils,

2345
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,820
the tonality of your
face, how flushed you are,

2346
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:59,140
or how pale you are,

2347
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,240
even the degree to which you're frowning

2348
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:04,673
or smiling relative to
other periods of time,

2349
01:44:06,986 --> 01:44:10,460
that is all an aggregate
of, or a reflection rather

2350
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:12,750
of your gut, your heart and your breathing

2351
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,480
and the chemistry of your body.

2352
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,390
And so this is why I sort of
backed into this conversation

2353
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:20,680
about interoception I kind
of Trojan horse this on you

2354
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,770
on purpose which is that

2355
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:24,620
when we talk about the
vagus and you hear, oh,

2356
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:27,200
you know, you can get vagal
tone by breathing or rubbing

2357
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,520
on the front of the or
short that's probably true,

2358
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,890
but another fundamental layer
is the acidity of your gut,

2359
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:36,470
how fast your breathing
are you inhale-emphasized,

2360
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:40,070
or exhale-emphasized breathing.

2361
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:44,753
When we are relaxed our
pupils tend to constrict.

2362
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:47,880
When we are very alert,

2363
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,530
our pupils tend to be
dilated, whether or not

2364
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:53,650
that alertness has to do with
being happy or being sad.

2365
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:56,780
And what's remarkable, and
this is where interoception

2366
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:00,000
really takes a leap into the incredible

2367
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,850
is that there are
beautiful studies that show

2368
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:06,120
that for instance, when we
know somebody pretty well

2369
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,537
and they are going through
some sort of experience

2370
01:45:09,537 --> 01:45:11,470
of any kind, our heart rate

2371
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:14,230
actually starts to mimic their heart rate.

2372
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:16,230
Our breathing starts to
mimic their breathing,

2373
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:18,770
even if we aren't conscious
of their breathing.

2374
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:20,820
It's not like we see their chest heaving,

2375
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,620
and we think, oh my goodness,
and then we breathe that way.

2376
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:27,070
There's a mirroring

2377
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:29,040
and no it's not carried
out through mirror neurons.

2378
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,160
Mirror neurons are more
of a myth and a reality,

2379
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,900
sorry to burst people's bubbles.

2380
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:35,560
But that bubble around mirror
neurons is definitely made of

2381
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:40,560
myths and a topic for another
time, but we start to mirror.

2382
01:45:41,070 --> 01:45:45,470
Somehow human beings are able
to register the internal state

2383
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,810
of other beings, and I think
probably for animals too,

2384
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:51,040
but certainly for other
humans, even at a distance.

2385
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,100
And these studies are many now,

2386
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,600
and they're really wonderful studies.

2387
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,270
And so your sense of
your internal landscape

2388
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:00,360
is linked to others.

2389
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,690
Now you can enhance this
interoceptive capacity

2390
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,530
for how you feel and how
others feel, in other words,

2391
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:09,810
you can start getting a better
readout of your internal

2392
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:14,810
state by doing a simple
exercise, what is really a tool.

2393
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:18,733
And that is to learn to
sense your heartbeats.

2394
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:23,340
So some people are very good
at this, other people are not,

2395
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,790
some people can do this more
easily when they have all their

2396
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,900
air exhaled and some
people can do it better

2397
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:30,630
when they are holding a breath hold.

2398
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:33,000
But one thing that's kind of cool

2399
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,050
about this whole interoceptive capacity

2400
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:38,463
is that you can enhance it very quickly.

2401
01:46:39,695 --> 01:46:41,660
You can learn or teach yourself
to have heightened levels

2402
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:45,400
of interoception in a way that
you can't really just give

2403
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:46,980
yourself heightened levels of vision

2404
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:49,700
by snapping your fingers, in
one of one tool or exercise,

2405
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:51,850
there are things you can
do to improve vision.

2406
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:53,400
That's the topic of a previous episode.

2407
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,545
I encourage you to look it up.

2408
01:46:54,545 --> 01:46:56,740
There are things you can
do to improve your hearing

2409
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:59,820
and your taste and your smell,
we talked about all those,

2410
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,900
but with interoception you can get

2411
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:04,335
very good at this very fast.

2412
01:47:04,335 --> 01:47:05,490
And I think this is one

2413
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:06,410
of the reasons why meditation is powerful.

2414
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,350
Think there are a lot of reasons
why meditation is powerful,

2415
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:10,680
but one of the reasons
is when you stop taking

2416
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:14,700
in exteroceptive information
from the outside world,

2417
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:17,713
by closing your eyes and
focusing inward, as they say,

2418
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:20,920
you start paying attention
to your breathing cadence,

2419
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:23,420
you start directing your mind's attention

2420
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,662
to your heart rate,

2421
01:47:24,662 --> 01:47:28,290
and if you can start to
perceive your heart beating.

2422
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:31,830
You actually are very quickly strengthen

2423
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:35,170
the vagal connections between
the body and the brain.

2424
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:36,940
And so there's no real practice here.

2425
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:39,460
There's no breathe this
way or do this thing

2426
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:45,430
except to direct your awareness
toward your heartbeat.

2427
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,560
And some people can get
very good at this very fast.

2428
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,180
Most people find that just by doing this

2429
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:52,880
for a minute or so, every once in a while,

2430
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,580
they start to tap into this sixth sense.

2431
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:59,640
They start to notice when
they don't feel quite right

2432
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,520
about something or
somebody or some situation,

2433
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,720
or they start to notice
when they feel quite right

2434
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:08,250
about somebody or something
or some situation.

2435
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,880
So this interoceptive
awareness can be tuned up.

2436
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,160
It used to be called vagal tone,

2437
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,600
but I think that term doesn't
take into account all the

2438
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,410
other things that are
going on with the vagus.

2439
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:18,800
So I don't really like that term.

2440
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,870
It's more of an interoceptive awareness.

2441
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,690
And again, there are
many studies now showing

2442
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:29,180
that for sake of bettering
one's mood overall,

2443
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:31,330
for sake of moving through
a challenging phase

2444
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:34,560
in life, for sake of just
enhancing one's experience

2445
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,770
of life overall, whether or
not it's the taste of foods,

2446
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:41,680
interactions with other people,
enjoyment, focus, pleasure,

2447
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:44,200
tuning up one's interoceptive awareness

2448
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:47,010
is both easy again by just
taking a minute or two

2449
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:48,970
and trying to count heartbeats.

2450
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:50,900
And then this works best, of course,

2451
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,240
if you have some independent
readout of heartbeats and you

2452
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,137
can compare, you can see
how accurate you are,

2453
01:48:56,137 --> 01:48:58,460
but even if you don't use
a device or have a device

2454
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:01,230
to do that, without taking your pulse,

2455
01:49:01,230 --> 01:49:03,470
using your thumb on your wrist
or something, or your fingers

2456
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:06,220
on your neck, as you typically
would for taking your pulse,

2457
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:09,960
trying to sit still for a
minute or two every once

2458
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,610
in a while, maybe once a
week, maybe twice a week,

2459
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:14,700
maybe while you're meditating,
maybe while breathwork,

2460
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,160
maybe during the breath
holds of breathwork,

2461
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,420
you don't really have to do this

2462
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,070
in any kind of extended way,

2463
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:22,010
you can very quickly increase
your interoceptive tone.

2464
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:24,800
And that has a huge and outsized effect

2465
01:49:26,267 --> 01:49:28,200
on the brain, body relationship

2466
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,060
and your brain's ability to tap into

2467
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:35,230
both the subconscious
and the conscious aspects

2468
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,170
of this chemical and mechanical signaling

2469
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,440
that's happening all the time.

2470
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,635
And it can have real and
out-sized positive effects

2471
01:49:40,635 --> 01:49:42,640
on your ability to engage

2472
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:45,900
with other people and your
ability to focus at work

2473
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:48,300
and your ability to notice, ah,

2474
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:52,340
I'm finding myself kind of
feeling like I'm losing focus,

2475
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:54,250
but really it was my heart
rate was just increasing.

2476
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:55,720
Maybe I just exhale a little bit

2477
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,903
and bring my heart rate down.

2478
01:49:59,185 --> 01:50:00,090
So whatever effectually tried to do today

2479
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:03,900
is to give you a window into
this incredible relationship

2480
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:06,197
between your viscera and
your brain and your brain

2481
01:50:06,197 --> 01:50:08,190
and your viscera, all
these organs of your body,

2482
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:11,360
and what I hope is that you'll appreciate

2483
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,690
that it's a system, that you
aren't just a system of tubes.

2484
01:50:14,690 --> 01:50:16,300
I said that in a sort of in jest, I mean,

2485
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,410
you have a lot of tubes and
you are a system of tubes,

2486
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:21,590
but that system of tubes is
linked through the nervous

2487
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:25,050
system, and those links
work in very specific ways.

2488
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:27,940
So whether or not you remember
about pesos and all the GLPRs

2489
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:30,280
and all that stuff, it
doesn't really matter.

2490
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:33,550
What I encourage you to do
is start sort of pushing and

2491
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:36,300
pulling on the various leavers
within this beautiful system

2492
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:40,380
that we call the interoceptive
system, this sense of self.

01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,520
During the course of today's episode,

2509
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,030
and on previous episodes,
I mentioned supplements.

2510
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:19,840
I realized supplements
aren't for everybody,

2511
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,120
but for those of you that are
interested in supplements,

2512
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:24,890
it is important that the
supplements that you take have a

2513
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:28,030
high level of stringency
with respect to the amounts

2514
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:30,110
of the contents that are
listed on the bottle matching

2515
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:33,040
what's actually in the bottle,
in the capsules and tablets,

2516
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,850
and that the quality of those
ingredients be extremely high.

2517
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:39,720
For that reason we partnered
with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E

2518
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,750
because Thorne supplements
have the highest levels

2519
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:45,030
of stringency for both
the content and the amount

2520
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:47,230
of content in those
bottles and supplements.

2521
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:49,660
If you want to try Thorne supplements,

2522
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,170
and you want to see the
supplements that I take,

2523
01:51:51,170 --> 01:51:55,670
you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman.

2524
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:57,290
And you can see all the
supplements that I take.

2525
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:59,710
You can get 20% off any of those.

2526
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:02,270
And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,

2527
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:04,390
you can get 20% off any of the supplements

2528
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:05,650
that Thorne makes.

2529
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:07,563
In addition we have a Patreon account,

2530
01:52:08,422 --> 01:52:10,510
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2532
