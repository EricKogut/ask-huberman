00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,350
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,670
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,859
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:08,442
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,780
My name is Andrew Huberman

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,550
and I'm a professor of Neurobiology

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,890
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford school of medicine.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,170
This podcast is separate

9
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,500
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,250
It is however, part of my desire

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,910
and effort to bring zero
cost to consumer information

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,970
about science and science related tools

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,810
to the general public.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,420
In keeping with that theme.

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,450
I want to thank the first
sponsor of today's podcast.

16
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,980
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,890
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,820
that analyzes blood factors
and DNA related factors

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,250
that helps you develop a
personalized health plan.

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,430
Many important factors
related to our health

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,710
and wellbeing can only be measured

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,780
by a blood sample and by a DNA sample.

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,640
I've been getting my blood
work done for many years now.

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,090
And I use InsideTracker

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,800
because InsideTracker makes it very easy

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,900
to not only get the blood work done,

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,180
someone can come to your house

28
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,450
or you can go to a clinic for instance

29
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,150
but also to interpret
the data that you get.

30
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,300
Oftentimes when we get blood work done

31
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,020
there are all these numbers
and all these levels

32
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,570
of different hormones and
metabolic factors and so forth.

33
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,504
But one doesn't know what
to do with that information

34
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,320
InsideTracker has a
terrific dashboard platform

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,780
where you go online and it
makes analyzing all that easy.

36
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,910
And it also provides some very simple

37
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,490
and straightforward directives

38
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,300
in terms of exercise, nutrition

39
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,080
and other lifestyle factors
that can help guide your health

40
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720
and improve your health.

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,510
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

42
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,910
you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

43
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,840
and use the code "Huberman" at checkout

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,750
to get 25% off your order.

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,680
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,210
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditating easy.

47
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,510
I've been meditating on and off
for about three decades now.

48
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,150
And typically it's been more off than on.

49
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,260
I think like a lot of people

50
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,300
I find it hard to stick
with a meditation practice.

51
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,080
A few years ago, I started
using the Headspace app.

52
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,040
And when I did that,

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,550
I found that I was meditating
really consistently.

54
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,180
First of all, the meditations
in Headspace are backed

55
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,870
by quality scientific
peer reviewed studies.

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,130
Second of all the meditations
allow the meditation

57
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,120
to be kind of easy and fun to access.

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,380
I started first using
them when I would travel

59
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,760
because on JetBlue flights,

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,560
which was the airline I was using

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,680
the meditations are
offered as an alternative

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,740
to watching a TV or a movie.

63
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,930
And I found that I would arrive
feeling much more refreshed

64
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,420
than had I just sort of zoned
out on the TV the whole time,

65
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,410
or even if I had slept.

66
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,960
And I'll continue to
use Headspace regularly

67
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,280
pretty much every day
for a short meditation.

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,330
And I personally derive
tremendous benefits from it.

69
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,160
If you'd like to try Headspace

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,630
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer

71
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,560
and they'll give you one
month of all the meditations

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,420
that they have available completely free.

73
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,160
That's the best offer available
right now from Headspace.

74
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,040
So you can go to
headspace.com/specialoffer

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,140
and you'll get one month completely free

76
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,290
all the meditations they have.

77
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,056
The third sponsor of
today's podcast is Madefor.

78
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:09,300
Madefor as a behavioral science company

79
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,100
that is a subscription model

80
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,810
in which you engage in
specific activities each month

81
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,760
for 10 months in order to bring about

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,880
positive behavioral
change and growth mindset.

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,060
The company was founded by
former Navy seal Patrick Dossett

84
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,640
as well as Toms founder Blake Mycoskie.

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,920
I'm the lead advisor of the
scientific advisory board

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,630
at Madefor and some of the other members

87
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,940
of the advisory board include

88
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,440
the head of the chronobiology unit

89
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,250
at the national institute of health

90
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,740
as well as psychiatrists
from Harvard, UC Irvine

91
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,700
and many other individuals
who are serious about science

92
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,400
and helped develop the Madefor program.

93
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,210
If you want to try Madefor,
you can go to getmadefor.com

94
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,290
and if you enter "Huberman" at checkout

95
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,393
you'll get 15% off the program.

96
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,860
Today we're talking about neuroplasticity

97
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,220
which is this incredible
feature of our nervous systems

98
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,910
that allows it to change
in response to experience.

99
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,840
neuroplasticity is arguably

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,150
one of the most important
aspects of our biology.

101
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,710
It holds the promise
for each and all of us

102
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,330
to think differently, to learn new things,

103
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,840
to forget painful experiences

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,529
and to essentially adapt to
anything that life brings us

105
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,722
by becoming better.

106
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,570
Neuroplasticity has a
long and important history

107
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,150
and we're not going to
review all of it in detail.

108
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,150
But today what we are
going to do is discuss

109
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,380
what is neuroplasticity?

110
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,530
As well as the different
forms of neuroplasticity.

111
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,110
We're going to talk about
how to access neuroplasticity

112
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,610
depending on how old you are

113
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,540
and depending on the
specific types of changes

114
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,600
that you're trying to create.

115
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,880
This is a topic for which
there are lots of tools,

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,320
as well as lots of biological principles

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
that we can discuss.

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,690
So let's get started.

119
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,880
Most people are familiar with
the word neuroplasticity.

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,030
It's sometimes also
called neural plasticity.

121
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,590
Those are the same thing.

122
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,350
So, if I say neuroplasticity
or neural plasticity,

123
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm referring to the same process,

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,970
which is the brain and
nervous system's ability

125
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,500
to change itself.

126
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,740
There are a lot of reasons

127
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,750
why the nervous system would do this.

128
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,900
It could do it in response
to some traumatic event.

129
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,710
It could, for instance,
create a sense of fear

130
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,080
around a particular place

131
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,640
or a fear of automobiles or planes.

132
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,680
It could also occur when
something positive happens,

133
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,830
like the birth of our first child

134
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,660
or when our puppy does something amusing

135
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,453
or we see an incredible feat
of performance in athleticism.

136
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,490
The word neuroplasticity

137
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,373
means so many things to
so many different people

138
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,750
that I thought it would be important

139
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,870
to just first put a little
bit of organizational logic

140
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,340
around what it is and how it happens,

141
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,460
because nowadays if you were to go online

142
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,850
and Google the word neuroplasticity,

143
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,470
you would find hundreds of
thousands of references,

144
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,940
scientific references

145
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,740
as well as a lot of falsehoods
about what neuroplasticity is

146
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,460
and how to access it.

147
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,330
As I mentioned before,

148
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,860
we're going to talk
about the science of it

149
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,080
and we're going to talk about the tools

150
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,500
that allow you to engage

151
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,930
this incredible feature
of your nervous system.

152
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,080
And that's the first point,

153
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,280
which is that all of us were
born with a nervous system

154
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,460
that isn't just capable of change,

155
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,490
but was designed to change.

156
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,053
When we enter the world,

157
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,660
our nervous system is primed for learning.

158
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,780
The brain and nervous system of a baby

159
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,160
is wired very crudely.

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
The connections are not precise.

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
And we can see evidence of that

162
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,780
in the fact that babies
are kind of flopping,

163
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,230
they're like a little
potato bug with limbs.

164
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,220
They can't really do much in
terms of coordinated movement.

165
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,260
They certainly can't speak

166
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,530
and they can't really do
anything with precision.

167
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,980
And that's because we come
into this world overconnected.

168
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,420
We have essentially wires,

169
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,840
those wires have names
like axons and dendrites.

170
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,350
Those are the different
parts of the neurons

171
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,840
discussed in episode one,

172
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,550
but those little parts and
those wires and connections

173
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,090
are everywhere.

174
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,070
Imagine a bunch of roads

175
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,140
that are all connected to one
another in kind of a mess,

176
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,900
but there are no highways.

177
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,110
They're all just small roads.

178
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,780
That's essentially what the
young nervous system is like.

179
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,570
And then as we mature, as
we go from day one of life

180
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,920
to 10 years old, 20
years old, 30 years old,

181
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,130
what happens is

182
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,350
particular connections get
reinforced and stronger

183
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,540
and other connections are lost.

184
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,150
So that's the first important principle

185
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,220
that I want everyone to understand,

186
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,990
which is that developmental plasticity,

187
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,800
the neuroplasticity that
occurs from the time we're born

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,030
until about age 25 is mainly a process

189
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,360
of removing connections that
don't serve our goals well.

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,180
Now, of course, certain events happen

191
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,410
during that birth to 25 period

192
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,450
in which positive events
and negative events

193
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,860
are really stamped down
into our nervous system

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,510
in a very dramatic fashion,

195
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,440
by what we call one-trial learning.

196
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,880
We experience something once

197
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,440
and then our nervous
system is forever changed

198
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,500
by that experience.

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,560
Unless of course, we go through some work

200
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,320
to undo that experience.

201
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,550
So, I want you to imagine in your mind

202
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,540
that when you were
brought into this world,

203
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,530
you were essentially a widely
connected web of connections

204
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,390
that was really poor
at doing any one thing.

205
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,049
And that through your experience,

206
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,929
what you were exposed to by your parents

207
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,269
or rather caretakers,

208
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,250
through your social interactions,
through your thoughts,

209
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,970
through the languages that you learn,

210
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,200
through the places you
traveled or didn't travel,

211
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,510
your nervous system became customized

212
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,930
to your unique experience.

213
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,540
Now, that's true for
certain parts of your brain

214
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,790
that are involved in what we call

215
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,330
representations of the outside world.

216
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,360
A lot of your brain

217
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,190
is designed to represent the visual world

218
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,610
or represent the auditory world

219
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,330
or represent the gallery of smells

220
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,020
that are possible in the world.

221
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,480
However, there are aspects
of your nervous system

222
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,610
that were designed not to be plastic.

223
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,570
They were wired so that plasticity

224
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,200
or changes in those
circuits is very unlikely.

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,260
Those circuits include things like,

226
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,170
the ones that control your heartbeat,

227
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,040
the ones that control your breathing,

228
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,790
the ones that control your digestion,

229
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,670
And thank goodness that those
circuits were set up that way

230
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,510
because you want those circuits
to be extremely reliable.

231
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,000
You never want to have to think about

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,340
whether or not your heart will beat

233
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,970
or whether or not you
will continue breathing

234
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,730
or whether or not you'll be
able to digest your food.

235
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,800
So many nervous system
features like digestion

236
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,653
and breathing and heart
rate are hard to change.

237
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,080
Other aspects of our nervous system

238
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,780
are actually quite easy to change.

239
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,760
And one of the great gifts of childhood,

240
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,600
adolescence and young adulthood,

241
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,020
is that we can learn through
almost passive experience.

242
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,770
We don't have to focus that hard

243
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,420
in order to learn new things.

244
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,720
In fact, children go
from being able to speak

245
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,270
no language whatsoever

246
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,420
to being able to speak many many words

247
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,700
and comprise sentences

248
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,750
including words they've never heard before

249
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,750
which is remarkable.

250
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,610
It means that

251
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,210
the portions of the brain
involved in speech and language

252
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,623
are actually primed to learn
and create new combinations.

253
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,860
What this tells us is that the young brain

254
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,040
is a plasticity machine.

255
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,550
But then right about age 25
plus or minus a year or two,

256
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,290
everything changes.

257
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,350
After age 25 or so,

258
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,830
in order to get changes
in our nervous system,

259
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,560
we have to engage in a completely
different set of processes

260
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,460
in order to get those changes to occur

261
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,660
and for them more
importantly to stick around.

262
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,170
And this is something that
I think is vastly overlooked

263
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,580
in the popular culture
discussion about neuroplasticity.

264
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,710
People always talk about
fire together, wire together.

265
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,370
Fire together wire together is true.

266
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,330
It is the statement of
my colleague at Stanford,

267
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,260
Carla Shatz

268
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,830
and it's an absolute truth

269
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,880
about the way that the
nervous system wires up

270
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,550
early in development.

271
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,360
But, fire together wire together

272
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,380
doesn't apply in the
same way after age 25.

273
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,070
And so we have these little
memes and these little quotes

274
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,180
that, you know circulate on the internet

275
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,830
like fire together, wire together

276
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,010
or there's a famous quote

277
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,080
from the greatest neurobiologist
of all time, Ramón y Cajal.

278
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,410
I think it goes something like, you know

279
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,730
should somebody wish to
change their nervous system

280
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,140
they could be the sculptor
of their nervous system

281
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,320
in any way they want, something like that.

282
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,310
And that sounds great.

283
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,270
I mean, who wouldn't want to
change their nervous system

284
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,370
any way they want,

285
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,820
but what's lost in those statements

286
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,960
is how to actually accomplish that.

287
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,700
And we're going to cover that today

288
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,290
but please understand
that early in development

289
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,370
your nervous system is
connected very broadly

290
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,120
in ways that make it very
hard to do anything well.

291
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,960
From birth until about age 25

292
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,910
those connections get refined

293
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,360
mainly through the removal

294
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,030
of connections that don't serve us

295
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,050
and the incredible
strengthening of connections

296
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,060
that relate to either powerful experiences

297
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,240
or that allow us to do
things like walk and talk

298
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,520
and do math, et cetera.

299
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,680
And then after age 25,

300
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,540
if we want to change those connections,

301
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,640
those super highways of connectivity,

302
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,710
we have to engage in some
very specific processes.

303
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,190
And those processes, as
we'll soon learn are gated.

304
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,340
Meaning you can't just
decide to change your brain.

305
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
You actually have to go
through a series of steps

306
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,450
to change your internal state

307
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,300
in ways that will allow
you to change your brain.

308
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,870
I just want to acknowledge that

309
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,500
Costello is snoring
particularly loud today.

310
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,760
Some of you seem very keen
at picking up on his snoring,

311
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,010
others of you can't hear his snoring.

312
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,010
It's very low rumbling sound

313
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,690
and whether or not you can or you can't

314
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,780
probably relates to the
sensitivity of your hearing.

315
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,980
We're actually going to talk
about perfect pitch today

316
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,270
and range of auditory detection.

317
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,390
And so if you can hear
Costello's snoring enjoy,

318
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,223
if you can't, enjoy.

319
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,870
I want to talk about how
the nervous system changes.

320
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,160
What are these changes?

321
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,960
Many of us have been captivated

322
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,880
by the stories in the popular press

323
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,670
about the addition of new neurons.

324
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,050
This idea, oh, if you go
running or you exercise,

325
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,460
your brain actually makes new neurons.

326
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,530
Well, I'm going to give you the
bad news first which is that,

327
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,090
after puberty, so after
about age 14 or 15,

328
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,490
the human brain and nervous
system adds very few

329
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,030
if any new neurons.

330
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,260
The idea that new neurons
could be added to the brain

331
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,520
is one that has a rich history
in experimental science.

332
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,410
It's clear that in rodents
and in some non-human primates

333
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,850
new neurons, a process
called neurogenesis,

334
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,000
can occur in areas of the brain,
such as the olfactory bulb,

335
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,010
which is of course involved in smell

336
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,890
as well as a region of our hippocampus,

337
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,250
a center of the brain involved in memory

338
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,070
called the dentate gyrus
of the hippocampus.

339
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,780
And there is strong evidence

340
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,180
that new neurons can be
added to those structures

341
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,000
throughout the lifespan.

342
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,430
In humans, the evidence is a
little bit more controversial.

343
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,490
It's clear that we can add new neurons

344
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,340
to our olfactory bulb.

345
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,170
In fact, if any of you have ever

346
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,150
had the unfortunate experience

347
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,460
of being hit on the head too hard,

348
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,160
the wires called axons from
those olfactory neurons

349
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,490
that live in your nose

350
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,580
can get sheared off

351
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,220
because they have to
pass through a bony plate

352
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,250
called the cribriform plate.

353
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,620
And the cribriform plate
can shear those axons

354
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,140
and people can become
what's called anosmic,

355
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,950
they won't be able to smell.

356
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,490
But over time, those neurons

357
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,020
unlike most all central
nervous system neurons

358
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,440
can grow those connections back

359
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,350
and even reestablish new neurons

360
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,300
being added to the olfactory bulb.

361
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,000
They come from elsewhere deep in the brain

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
and they migrate through a pathway called

363
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,930
the rostral migratory stream.

364
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,100
You can Google these words

365
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,140
and look up some of the
descriptions of this

366
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,530
if you'd like to learn more.

367
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,670
So indeed there is some evidence

368
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,810
that the neurons responsible for smell

369
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,690
can be replaced throughout the lifespan.

370
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,880
Certainly, in very young individuals

371
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,253
from birth till about age 15 or so.

372
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,180
Whether or not they're new
neurons added to the hippocampus,

373
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,740
the memory center of the
human brain isn't clear.

374
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,010
Many years ago, Rusty Gage's
lab at the Salk Institute

375
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,540
did a really important study

376
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,390
looking at terminally ill cancer patients

377
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,370
and injecting them with a label,

378
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,000
a dye that is incorporated
only into new neurons.

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,510
And after these patients died,
their brains were harvested.

380
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,330
The brains were looked at and
there were new neurons there,

381
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,530
there was evidence for new neurons.

382
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,560
Those results I think stand over time

383
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,520
but what was not really discussed

384
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,250
in the popular press
discussion around those papers

385
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,760
was that it was very few
cells that were being added.

386
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,790
And a number of papers have
come along over the years

387
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,490
mainly from labs at UCSF,
although from others as well,

388
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,580
showing that if there are new neurons

389
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,430
added to the adult brain,

390
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,740
it's an infinitesimally
small number of new neurons.

391
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,880
So that's the depressing part,
we don't get new neurons.

392
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,160
After we're born, we pretty
much have the neurons

393
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
that we're going to use our entire life.

394
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,900
And yes, as we get older

395
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,480
and we start to lose certain
functions in our brain,

396
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,020
we lose neurons.

397
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,410
But all is not lost, so to speak,

398
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,900
because there are other
ways in which neurocircuits

399
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,910
can create new connections
and add new functions

400
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,200
including new memory, new abilities

401
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,363
and new cognitive functions.

402
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,620
And those are mainly through the process

403
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,750
of making certain connections,

404
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,540
which of course are those
things we call synapses,

405
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,320
between neurons making
those connections stronger.

406
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,540
So they're more reliable,

407
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,620
they're more likely to engage

408
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,910
as well as removing connections.

409
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,030
And the removal of connections is vital

410
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,640
to say moving through a grieving process

411
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,220
or removing the emotional load
of a traumatic experience.

412
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,370
So even though we can't add new neurons

413
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,070
throughout our lifespan,

414
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,210
at least not in very great numbers,

415
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,610
it's clear that we can
change our nervous system,

416
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,609
that the nervous system
is available for change,

417
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,319
that if we create the
right set of circumstances

418
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,839
in our brain, chemical circumstances,

419
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,259
and if we create the right

420
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,940
environmental circumstances around us,

421
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,400
our nervous system will
shift into a mode in which

422
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,119
change isn't just possible
but it's probable.

423
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,769
As I mentioned before,

424
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,109
the hallmark of the child
nervous system is change,

425
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,919
it wants to change.

426
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,880
The whole thing,

427
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,210
everything from the chemicals

428
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,670
that are sloshing around in there

429
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,220
to the fact that there's a lot
of space between the neurons.

430
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,860
A lot of people don't know
this, but early in development

431
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,247
there's a lot of space
between the neurons.

432
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,270
And so the neurons can
literally move around

433
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,340
and sample different
connections very easily

434
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,190
removing some and keeping others.

435
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,550
As we get older, the
so-called extracellular space

436
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,330
is actually filled up

437
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,780
by things called extracellular
matrix and glial cells.

438
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,770
Glial means glue.

439
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,040
Those cells are involved in a
bunch of different processes

440
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,190
but they start to fill in all the space

441
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,610
kind of like pouring
concrete between rocks.

442
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,580
And when that happens,
it becomes much harder

443
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,120
to change the connections that are there.

444
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,590
One of the ways in which
we can all get plasticity

445
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,870
at any stage throughout the lifespan

446
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,820
is through deficits and impairments

447
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,070
in what we call our sensory apparati,

448
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,500
our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth,

449
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,170
and there are some very dramatic

450
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,760
and somewhat tragic examples of people,

451
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,600
for instance who have genetic mutations

452
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
where they're born without a nose

453
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,170
and without any olfactory
structures in the brain

454
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,340
so they cannot smell.

455
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,940
In that case areas of the brain

456
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,000
that normally would represent smell

457
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,300
become overtaken by areas of the brain

458
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,250
involved in other things like
touch and hearing and sight.

459
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,650
In individuals that are blind from birth,

460
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,410
the so-called occipital cortex,

461
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,160
the visual cortex in the back,

462
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,000
becomes overtaken by hearing.

463
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,680
The neurons there will
start to respond to sounds

464
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,020
as well as braille touch.

465
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,920
And actually there's a one
particularly tragic incident

466
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,160
where a woman who was blind since birth

467
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,710
and because of neuroimaging studies,

468
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,540
we knew her visual cortex
was no longer visual,

469
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,870
it was responsible for braille
reading and for hearing,

470
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,910
she had a stroke that actually took out

471
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,190
most of the function of her visual cortex.

472
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,220
So then she was blind, she
couldn't braille read or hear.

473
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,650
She did recover some aspect of function.

474
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,210
Now, most people they don't end up in that

475
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,990
highly unfortunate situation.

476
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,280
And what we know is that for instance,

477
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,800
blind people who use their visual cortex

478
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,880
for braille reading and for hearing,

479
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,380
have much better auditory
acuity and touch acuity.

480
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,400
Meaning they can sense
things with their fingers

481
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,180
and they can sense
things with their hearing

482
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,440
that typical sighted
folks wouldn't be able to.

483
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,660
In fact, you will find a much greater

484
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,350
incidence of perfect pitch
in people that are blind.

485
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,400
And that tells us that the brain

486
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,600
and in particular this
area we call the neocortex,

487
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,940
which is the outer part,

488
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,830
is really designed to be a map

489
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,050
of our own individual experience.

490
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,130
So these, what I call
experiments of impairment or loss

491
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,960
where somebody is blind from
birth or deaf from birth

492
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,960
or maybe has a limb development impairment

493
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,475
where they have a stump
instead of an entire limb

494
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,400
with a functioning hand,

495
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,100
their brain will represent
the body plan that they have,

496
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
not some other body plan.

497
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,200
But the beauty of the situation is that

498
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,030
the real estate up in the
skull, that neocortex,

499
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,320
the essence of it is to be a
customized map of experience.

500
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,380
Now, it is true however,

501
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,037
that if let's say I were
to be blind when I'm 50,

502
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:42,363
I'm 45 right now, I've
always been sighted.

503
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,930
If I was blind at 50,

504
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,460
I'll probably have less opportunity

505
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,610
to use my formerly visual cortex

506
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,730
for things like braille
reading and hearing

507
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,160
because my brain has changed,

508
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,840
it's just not the same brain
I had when I was a baby.

509
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,070
So there's actually a
principle of biology,

510
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,180
not many people know this,

511
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,190
it's actually a principle neurology

512
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,180
which is called the Kennard principle,

513
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,020
which says, if you're going
to have a brain injury,

514
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,797
you want to have it early in life.

515
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:12,270
And of course better to not
have a brain injury at all

516
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,360
but if you're going to have it

517
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,860
you want to have it early in life.

518
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,640
And this is based on a
tremendous number of experiments

519
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,420
examining the amount of recovery

520
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,840
and the rate of recovery in humans

521
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,540
that had lesions to their brain

522
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,380
either early in life or later in life.

523
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,570
So the Kennard Principle says

524
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,850
better to have injuries early in life.

525
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,110
Now, that's reassuring
for the young folks,

526
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,440
it's not so reassuring
for the older folks.

527
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,823
But there are aspects of neuroplasticity

528
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,690
that have nothing to do with impairments.

529
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,290
I mean earlier I said

530
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,640
we're all walking around with this map,

531
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,810
this representation of the world around us

532
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,640
so we can see edges, we can see colors,

533
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,730
except for folks that are
color blind of course,

534
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,640
and we also have a map
of emotional experience.

535
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,920
We have a map of whether or not

536
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,600
certain people are trustworthy,

537
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,650
certain people aren't trustworthy.

538
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,890
A few years ago I was at a course

539
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,440
and a woman came up to me and she said,

540
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,150
you know, I wasn't teaching
the course, I was in the course

541
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,490
and she said, "I just have to tell you

542
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,830
that every time you speak,
it really stresses me out."

543
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,030
And I said, "Well I've heard that before

544
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,180
but do you want to be more specific?"

545
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,850
And she said, "Yeah, your tone of voice

546
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,830
reminds me of somebody

547
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,810
that I had a really
terrible experience with."

548
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,490
I said, "Well, okay, well,
I can't change my voice

549
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,830
but I really appreciate
that you acknowledge that

550
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,956
and it also will help explain why

551
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:30,420
you seem to cringe every time I speak",

552
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,640
which I hadn't noticed until then

553
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,420
but after that I did notice.

554
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,570
She had a very immediate

555
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,240
and kind of visceral
response to my speech,

556
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,420
perhaps some of you are
having that right now.

557
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,500
But in any event, over the
period of this two-week course,

558
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,527
she would come back every
once in a while and say,

559
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,700
"You know what I think,
just by telling you

560
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,740
that your voice was really
difficult for me to listen to,

561
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,750
it's actually becoming
more tolerable to me."

562
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,600
And by the end we actually
became pretty good friends

563
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
and we're still in touch.

564
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,150
And so what this says is that
the recognition of something

565
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,760
whether or not that's an emotional thing

566
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,880
or a desire to learn something else

567
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,630
is actually the first
step in neuroplasticity.

568
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,900
And that's because

569
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,030
our nervous system has two
broad sets of functions.

570
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,440
Some of those functions are reflexive.

571
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,880
Things like our breathing, our
heart rate, our obvious ones,

572
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,430
but other aspects are reflexive
like our ability to walk.

573
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,600
If I get up out of this chair
and walk out of the door,

574
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,390
I don't think about each
step that I'm taking

575
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,010
and that's because I learned
how to walk during development.

576
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,160
But when we decide that
we're going to shift

577
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,250
some sort of behavior or some reaction

578
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,670
or some new piece of information
that we want to learn,

579
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,180
it's something that we want to
bring into our consciousness,

580
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,140
that awareness is a remarkable thing

581
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,810
because it cues the brain

582
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,530
and the rest of the nervous system

583
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,990
that when we engage in
those reflexive actions

584
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,130
going forward,

585
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,640
that those reflexive actions

586
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,030
are no longer fated to be reflexive.

587
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,390
Now if this sounds a little bit abstract,

588
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,640
we're going to talk about
protocols for how to do this.

589
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,010
But the first step in neuroplasticity

590
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,610
is recognizing that you
want to change something

591
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,330
and you should immediately say, well,

592
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,190
kids don't go into school and say,

593
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,700
oh, I want to learn language

594
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,370
or I want to learn social interactions,

595
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,880
and that's the beauty of childhood.

596
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,330
The whole brain has this switch flipped

597
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,090
that is making change possible

598
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,650
but after that we have to be deliberate.

599
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,750
We have to know what it is
exactly that we want to change.

600
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,300
Or if we don't know exactly what it is

601
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,480
that we want to change,

602
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,810
we at least have to know that
we want to change something

603
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,570
about some specific experience.

604
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,120
In this case, I believe
that she came and told me

605
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,690
that my voice was really
awful for her to listen to

606
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,770
not to make me feel bad
or for any other reason

607
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,070
except that she wanted
it to not be the case.

608
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,010
And she knew I wasn't
going to stop talking.

609
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,580
So she decided to call
it to her consciousness

610
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,980
and mine as well.

611
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,430
So that's important.

612
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,680
If you want to learn something

613
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,410
or you want to change your
nervous system in any way,

614
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,500
whether or not it's
because of some impairment

615
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,510
or because of something
that you want to acquire,

616
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,510
a cognitive skill, a motor
skill, an emotional skill,

617
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,800
the first thing is recognizing
what that thing is.

618
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,510
And that often can be the
hardest thing to identify

619
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,470
but the brain has the self
recognition mechanisms

620
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,690
and those self recognition mechanisms

621
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,350
are not vague, spiritual or mystical

622
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,570
or even psychological concepts.

623
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,840
They are neurochemicals.

624
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,360
We're going to talk next
about the neurochemicals

625
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,410
that stamp down particular behaviors

626
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,450
and thoughts and emotional patterns

627
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,540
and tell the rest of the nervous system,

628
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,790
this is something to pay attention to

629
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,780
because this is in the
direction of the change

630
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,910
that I want to make.

631
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,610
So I'll repeat that, there
are specific chemicals

632
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,550
that when we are consciously aware

633
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,030
of a change we want to make

634
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,930
or even just that we
want to make some change,

635
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,130
chemicals are released in the brain

636
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,520
that allow us the opportunity
to make those changes.

637
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,850
Now, there are specific protocols

638
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,630
that science tells us We have to follow

639
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,830
if we want those changes to occur.

640
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,830
But that self-recognition is
not a kind of murky concept.

641
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,460
What it is is it's our fore brain,

642
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,380
in particular our prefrontal cortex,

643
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,540
signaling the rest of our nervous system

644
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,290
that something that we're about to do,

645
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,360
hear, feel or experience is
worth paying attention to.

646
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,580
So we'll pause there and then
I'm going to move forward.

647
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
One of the biggest lies in the universe

648
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,290
that seems quite prominent right now

649
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,170
is that every experience
you have changes your brain.

650
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,350
People love to say this.

651
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,550
They love to say, your brain
is going to be different

652
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,430
after this lecture

653
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,890
or that your brain is going to
be different after today's class

654
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,880
than it was two days ago.

655
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,240
And that's absolutely not true.

656
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,490
The nervous system doesn't just change

657
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,660
because you experienced something

658
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,203
unless you're a very young child.

659
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,920
The nervous system changes

660
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,880
when certain neurochemicals are released

661
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,890
and allow whatever neurons
are active in the period

662
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,900
in which those chemicals
are swimming around,

663
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,210
to strengthen or weaken the
connections of those neurons.

664
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,970
Now, this is best illustrated

665
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,760
through a little bit
of scientific history.

666
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,280
The whole basis of neuroplasticity

667
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,760
is essentially ascribed
to two individuals,

668
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,960
although there were a lot more people

669
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,030
that were involved in this work.

670
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,340
Those two individuals

671
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,970
go by the name David
Hubel and Torsten Wiesel.

672
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,830
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel
started off at Johns Hopkins,

673
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,710
moved to Harvard medical school.

674
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,340
And in the seventies and eighties,

675
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,190
they did a series of experiments,

676
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,843
recording electrical
activity in the brain.

677
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,890
They were in the visual cortex,

678
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,930
meaning they put the electrodes
in the visual cortex,

679
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,920
and they were exploring how vision works

680
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,570
and how the visual brain
organizes all the features

681
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,010
of the visual world to give us these

682
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,560
incredible things We
call visual perceptions.

683
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,620
But Hubel was a physician.

684
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,070
And he was very interested in what happens

685
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,160
when for instance, a
child comes into the world

686
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,690
and they have a cataract,

687
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,020
the lens of their eye,
isn't clear but it's opaque.

688
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,450
Or when a kid has a lazy eye

689
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,300
or the eyes have what's called strabismus,

690
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,283
which is when the eyes either
deviate outward or inward.

691
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,250
These are very common things of childhood,

692
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,240
especially in particular
areas of the world.

693
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,260
And what David and Torsten
did is they figured out

694
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,070
that there was a critical period

695
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,110
in which if clear vision did not occur,

696
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,560
the visual brain would
completely rewire itself,

697
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,860
basically to represent

698
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,870
whatever bit of visual
information was coming in.

699
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,950
So they did these experiments

700
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,410
to kind of simulate a droopy
eye or a deviating eye

701
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,740
where they would close one eyelid

702
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
and then what they found
is that the visual brain

703
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,800
would respond entirely to the open eye.

704
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,130
There was sort of a
takeover of the visual brain

705
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,203
representing the open eye.

706
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,300
Many experiments in many
different sensory systems

707
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,200
followed up on this.

708
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,640
There are beautiful
experiments for instance,

709
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,570
from Gregg Recanzone's lab up at UC Davis

710
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,060
and Mike Merzenich's lab at UCSF

711
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,460
showing that for instance

712
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,890
if two fingers were taped
together early in development,

713
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,610
so they weren't moving independently,

714
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,220
the representation of those two fingers

715
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,730
would become fused in the brain

716
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,700
so that the person couldn't
actually distinguish

717
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,050
the movements and the sensations

718
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,230
of the two fingers
separately, pretty remarkable.

719
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,580
All of this is to say that
David and Torsten's work,

720
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,470
for which they won a noble prize,

721
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,120
they shared it with Rogers Barry,

722
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,460
their work showed that

723
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,480
the brain is in fact a customized
map of the outside world,

724
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,810
we said that already.

725
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,270
But that what it's doing is it's measuring

726
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,840
the amount of activity for
a given part of our body,

727
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,090
one eye or the other, or our fingers,

728
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,260
this finger or that finger

729
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,840
and all of those inputs are competing

730
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,900
for space in the brain.

731
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,830
Now this is fundamentally important

732
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,700
because what it means is that

733
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,060
if we are to change our
nervous system in adulthood,

734
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,810
we need to think about not
just what we're trying to get,

735
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,100
but what we're trying to give up.

736
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,330
We can't actually add new connections

737
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,610
without removing something else.

738
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,140
And that might seem like kind of a stinger

739
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,640
but it actually turns out
to be a great advantage.

740
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,030
One of the key experiments
that David and Torsten did

741
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,760
was an experiment where
they closed both eyes,

742
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,870
where they essentially
removed all visual input

743
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,120
early in development.

744
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,700
Now this is slightly
different than blindness

745
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,720
because it was transient,

746
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,620
it was only for a short period of time.

747
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,530
But what they found is when they did that

748
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,790
there was no change.

749
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,270
However, if they would close just one eye

750
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,060
there was a huge change.

751
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,470
So when people tell you,

752
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,250
oh at the end of today's lecture,

753
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,630
or at the end of something

754
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,720
your brain is going to
be completely different,

755
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,810
that's simply not true.

756
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,150
If you're older than 25

757
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,030
your brain will not change

758
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,620
unless there's a selective
shift in your attention

759
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,370
or a selective shift in your experience

760
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,130
that tells the brain it's time to change.

761
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,860
And those changes occur

762
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,190
through the ways I talked about before

763
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,520
strengthening and weakening
of particular connections,

764
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,220
they have names like
long-term potentiation,

765
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,810
long-term depression,
which has nothing to do

766
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,370
with emotional depression by the way,

767
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,940
spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

768
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,410
I threw out those names
not to confuse you,

769
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,070
but for those of you that would like

770
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,340
more in-depth exploration of those,

771
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,690
please you can go google
those and look them up,

772
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,210
there are great Wikipedia pages for them

773
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,560
and you can go down the paper trail.

774
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,230
I might even touch on them
on some subsequent episodes.

775
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,610
But the important thing
to understand is that

776
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,640
if we want something to change,

777
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,950
we really need to bring an
immense amount of attention

778
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,130
to whatever it is that we want to change.

779
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,610
This is very much linked to
the statement I made earlier

780
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,640
about, it all starts with an awareness.

781
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,150
Now, why is that attention important?

782
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,360
Well, David and Torsten
won their Nobel prize

783
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,250
and they certainly deserved it.

784
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,110
They probably deserved two

785
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,740
because they also figured
out how vision works.

786
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,910
And I might be biased

787
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,440
'cause they're my scientific
great-grandparents

788
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,420
but I think everybody in the
field of Neuroscience agrees

789
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,995
that Hubel and Wiesel, as they're called

790
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:51,690
H&W for those in the game,

791
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,190
absolutely deserved a
Nobel prize for their work

792
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,420
because they really unveiled
the mechanisms of brain change

793
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,090
of plasticity.

794
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,410
David passed away a few years
ago, Torsten is still alive,

795
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,590
he's in his late 90s,

796
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,200
he's still at the Rockefeller university.

797
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,320
He's sharp as a tack.

798
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,460
He still jogs several miles a day.

799
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,890
He's really into art and
a number of other things.

800
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,120
He's also a super nice guy.

801
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,660
Hubel was a really nice guy as well,

802
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,780
also he was a great
Frisbee player I discovered

803
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,790
'cause he beat me in a game of
ultimate when he was like 80,

804
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,120
which still, it has me a little bit irked.

805
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,950
But anyway, Hubel and Wiesel

806
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,040
did an amazing thing for science

807
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,440
that will forever change

808
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,340
the way that we think about the brain.

809
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,710
However, they were quite wrong

810
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,760
about this critical period thing.

811
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,730
The critical period was this idea that

812
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,440
if you were to deprive the
nervous system of an input,

813
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,360
say closing one eye early in development

814
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,510
and the rest of the visual cortex is taken

815
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,800
over by the representation
of the open eye,

816
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,960
that you could never change that

817
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,920
unless you intervened early.

818
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,340
And this actually formed the basis

819
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:55,190
for why a kid that has
a lazy eye or a cataract

820
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,890
why, even though there's some issues

821
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,120
with anesthesia in young children,

822
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,728
why now we know that you
want to get in there early

823
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:05,430
and fix the cataract or fix the strabismus

824
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,660
it's what ophthalmologists do.

825
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,030
However, their idea that
you had to do it early

826
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,150
or else there was no opportunity to rescue

827
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,640
the nervous system deficit later on

828
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,183
turned out wasn't entirely true.

829
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,740
In the early 90s, a graduate student

830
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,150
by the name of Gregg Recanzone
was in the laboratory

831
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,980
of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.

832
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,580
And they set out to test this idea

833
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,180
that if one wants to change their brain,

834
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,730
they need to do it early in life

835
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,140
because the adult brain
simply isn't plastic

836
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,610
it's not available for these changes.

837
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:43,313
And they did a series of
absolutely beautiful experiments,

838
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,810
by now I think we can say proving

839
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,310
that the adult brain can change

840
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,860
provided certain conditions are met.

841
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,240
Now, the experiments they did are tough.

842
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,500
They were tough on the experimenter

843
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,970
and they were tough on the subject.

844
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,253
I'll just describe one.

845
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,970
Let's say you were a subject
in one of their experiments.

846
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,110
You would come into the lab
and you'd sit down at a table

847
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,489
and they would record
from or image your brain

848
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,639
and look at the
representation of your fingers

849
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,769
the digits as we call them.

850
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,449
And there would be a spinning drum,

851
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:20,179
literally a like a stone drum
in front of your metal drum

852
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,519
that had little bumps.

853
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,530
Some of the bumps were
spaced close together,

854
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,400
some of them were spaced far apart.

855
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,130
And they would do these experiments

856
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,530
where they would expect their
subjects to press a lever

857
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,000
whenever for instance, the
bumps got closer together

858
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,929
or further apart and these
were very subtle differences.

859
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,779
So in order to do this you
really have to pay attention

860
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,719
to the distance between the bumps

861
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,309
and these were not braille readers

862
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,163
or anyone skilled in doing
these kinds of experiments.

863
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,219
What they found was that as people paid

864
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,859
more and more attention to the
distance between these bumps

865
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,370
and they would signal
when there was a change

866
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,270
by pressing a lever,

867
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,960
as they did that there
was very rapid changes

868
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,240
plasticity in the
representation of the fingers.

869
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,830
And it could go in either direction.

870
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,430
You could get people very
good at detecting the distance

871
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,390
between bumps, that the
distance was getting smaller

872
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,730
or that the distance was getting greater.

873
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,600
So people could get
very good at these tasks

874
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,950
that you're kind of hard to
imagine how they would translate

875
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,900
to the real world for
a non braille reader.

876
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,250
But what it told us is
that these maps of touch

877
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,710
were very much available for plasticity.

878
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,150
And these were fully adult subjects.

879
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,150
They're not taking any specific drugs.

880
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,720
They don't have any impairments
that we're aware of.

881
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,770
And what it showed, what it proved

882
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,860
is that the adult brain is very plastic.

883
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,020
And they did some beautiful
control experiments

884
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,090
that are important for
everyone to understand

885
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,730
which is that sometimes
they would bring people in

886
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,520
and they would have them touch these bumps

887
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,230
on this spinning drum but
they would have the person

888
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,030
pay attention to an auditory cue.

889
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,480
Every time a tone would go off,

890
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,990
or there was a shift in
the pitch of that tone,

891
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,280
they would have to signal that.

892
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,650
So the subject thought
they were doing something

893
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,520
related to touch and hearing
and all that showed was that

894
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,440
it wasn't just the mere action
of touching these bumps.

895
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,720
They had to pay attention
to the bumps themselves.

896
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,860
If they were placing their attention

897
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,920
on the auditory cue on the tone,

898
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,840
well then there was plasticity
in the auditory portion

899
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,230
of the brain but not on the
touch portion of the brain.

900
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,900
And this really spits in
the face of this thing

901
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,680
that you hear so often
which is every experience

902
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,970
that you have is going to
change the way your brain works.

903
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,090
Absolutely not.

904
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,690
The experiences that you pay
super careful attention to

905
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,680
are what open up plasticity

906
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,100
and it opens up plasticity
to that specific experience.

907
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,660
So the question then is why?

908
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,240
And Merzenich and his
graduate students and postdocs

909
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,600
went on to address this question of why.

910
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,480
And it turns out the answer

911
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,550
is a very straightforward
neurochemical answer.

912
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,140
And inside of that
answer is the opportunity

913
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,030
for any of us to change
our brain at any point

914
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,220
throughout our lifespan,

915
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,560
essentially for anything
that we want to learn,

916
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,390
that could be subtracting an emotion

917
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,110
from an experience we've had,

918
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,160
it could be building a
greater range of emotion,

919
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,450
it could be learning new information

920
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,030
like learning a new language.

921
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:14,030
It could be learning new motor
skill, like dance or sport

922
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,820
or it could be some
combination of cognitive motor.

923
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,470
So for instance, an air traffic
controller has to do a lot

924
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,850
with their mind in addition
to a lot with their hands.

925
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,420
So it's not just cognitive,

926
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,430
it's not just motor but combined.

927
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,730
So we're going to talk
about what that chemical is

928
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,010
but to just give you an important hint,

929
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,720
that chemical is the
same chemical of stress.

930
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,960
This is not a discussion
about stress per se.

931
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,680
In a future podcast episode,
we'll talk all about stress

932
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,000
and tools to deal with stress,

933
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,650
something my lab works
on quite extensively.

934
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,350
And it's a topic that I enjoy discussing.

935
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,800
But this is a topic about brain change.

936
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,730
And what I just told you

937
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,310
is that in order to change the brain

938
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,190
you have to pay careful attention.

939
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,100
And the immediate question
should be well, why?

940
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,670
Well, the answer is that
when we pay careful attention

941
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,392
there are two neurochemicals,

942
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,750
neuromodulators as they're called,

943
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,040
that are released from
multiple sites in our brain

944
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,310
that highlight the neural circuits

945
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,460
that stand a chance of changing.

946
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,800
Now it's not necessarily the case
that they're going to change,

947
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,860
but it's the first gate that has to open

948
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,350
in order for change to occur.

949
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,773
And the first neurochemical is
epinephrin, also adrenaline.

950
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,580
We call it adrenaline

951
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,560
when it's released from the adrenal glands

952
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,540
above our kidneys, that's in the body,

953
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,050
we call it epinephrin in the brain,

954
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,803
but they are chemically
identical substances.

955
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,110
Epinephrin is released from
a region in the brainstem

956
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,000
called locus coeruleus.

957
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,500
Fancy name, you don't need to
know it unless you want to.

958
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,810
Locus coeruleus sends
out these little wires

959
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,120
we call axons such that
it hoses the entire brain

960
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,400
essentially in this
neurochemical, epinephrin.

961
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,820
Now it's not always hosing
the brain with epinephrin.

962
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,500
It's only when we are in
high states of alertness

963
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,460
that this epinephrin is released.

964
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,260
But the way this circuit is
designed, it's very nonspecific.

965
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,370
It's essentially waking
up the entire brain

966
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,440
and that's because the
way that epinephrin works

967
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,020
by binding particular receptors

968
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,250
is to increase the likelihood
that neurons will be active.

969
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,190
So no alertness, no neuroplasticity.

970
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,610
However, alertness
alone is not sufficient.

971
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,070
As we would say, it's necessary

972
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,533
but not sufficient for neuroplasticity.

973
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,220
We know this is true also from
the work of Hubel and Wiesel

974
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,920
where they looked at brain plasticity

975
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,120
in response to certain experiences

976
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,910
in subjects that were
either awake or asleep.

977
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,650
And I hate to break it to you

978
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,780
but you cannot just simply
listen to things in your sleep

979
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,250
and learn those materials.

980
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,080
Later I'll talk about how
you can do certain things

981
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,300
in your sleep that you're unaware of

982
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,540
that can enhance learning of
things that you were aware of

983
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,830
while you were awake.

984
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,480
But that is not the same as
just listening to some music

985
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,030
or listening to a tape while you sleep

986
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,593
and expecting it to sink in, so to speak.

987
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,180
Epinephrin is released
when we pay attention

988
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,090
and when we are alert.

989
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,580
But the most important
thing for getting plasticity

990
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,940
is that there'll be epinephrin
which equates to alertness,

991
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,760
plus the release of this
neuromodulator, acetylcholine.

992
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,880
Now acetylcholine is released
from two sites in the brain.

993
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,560
One is also in the brainstem
and it's named different things

994
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,410
in different animals, but in humans

995
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,520
the most rich site of
acetylcholine neurons

996
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,310
or neurons that make acetylcholine

997
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,310
is the parabigeminal nucleus
or the parabrachial region.

998
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,370
There are a number of different names

999
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,720
of these aggregates of neurons.

1000
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,930
You don't need to know the names,

1001
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,180
all you need to know is
that you have an area

1002
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,110
in your brainstem and
that area sends wires,

1003
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,910
these axons up into the area of the brain

1004
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,220
that filters sensory input.

1005
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,290
So we have this area of the
brain called the thalamus

1006
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,440
and it is getting bombarded with all sorts

1007
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,100
of sensory input all the time.

1008
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,390
Costello snoring off to my right,

1009
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,490
the lights that are in the room,

1010
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,810
the presence of my computer to my left,

1011
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,380
all of that is coming in.

1012
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,270
But when I pay attention to something

1013
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,150
like if I really hone
in on Costello snoring,

1014
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,740
I create a cone of attention

1015
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,680
and what that cone of attention reflects

1016
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,680
is that acetylcholine is now
amplifying the signal of sounds

1017
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,630
that Costello is making with his snoring

1018
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,160
and essentially making that signal greater

1019
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,650
than all the signal around it,

1020
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,840
what we call signal-to-noise goes up.

1021
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,460
So those of you with an
engineering background

1022
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,100
will be familiar with signal-to-noise.

1023
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,830
Those of you who do not have
an engineering background,

1024
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,663
don't worry about it.

1025
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,050
All it means is that one
particular shout in the crowd

1026
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,140
comes through, Costello's
snoring becomes more salient,

1027
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,370
more apparent relative to
everything else going on.

1028
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,920
Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight

1029
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,980
but epinephrin for alertness.

1030
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,440
acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs.

1031
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,680
Those two things alone are
not enough to get plasticity.

1032
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,280
There needs to be this third component.

1033
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,760
And the third component
is acetylcholine released

1034
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,210
from an area of the forebrain
called nucleus basalis.

1035
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,360
If you really want to get technical,

1036
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,290
it's called nucleus basalis of Meynert.

1037
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,770
For any of you that
are buddying physicians

1038
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,050
or going to medical school,
you should know that.

1039
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,040
If you have acetylcholine
released from the brainstem,

1040
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,330
acetylcholine released from
nucleus basalis and epinephrin,

1041
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,580
you can change your brain.

1042
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
And I can say that with confidence

1043
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,760
because Merzenich and Recanzone

1044
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,460
as well as other members
of the Merzenich lab,

1045
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,950
Michael Kilgard and others

1046
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,540
did these incredible experiments
where they stimulated

1047
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,490
the release of acetylcholine
from nucleus basalis

1048
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,680
either with an electrode
or with some other methods

1049
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,060
that we'll talk about.

1050
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,170
And what they found was when you stimulate

1051
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,230
these three brain
regions, locus coeruleus,

1052
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,690
the brainstem source of acetylcholine

1053
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,400
and then the basal forebrain
source of acetylcholine.

1054
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,200
When you have those three things

1055
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,730
whatever you happen to
be listening to, doing

1056
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:08,200
or paying attention to
immediately in one trial

1057
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,240
takes over the representation

1058
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,110
of a particular area of the brain.

1059
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,200
You essentially get rapid
massive learning in one shop.

1060
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,560
And this has been shown
again and again and again

1061
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,820
in a variety of papers

1062
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,630
also by a guy named Norman
Weinberger from UC Irvine.

1063
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,560
And it is now considered
a fundamental principle

1064
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,780
of how the nervous system works.

1065
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,060
So while Hubel and Wiesel
talked about critical periods

1066
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,970
in developmental plasticity,

1067
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,760
it's very clear from the work of Merzenich

1068
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,300
and Weinberg and others, that
if you get these three things,

1069
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,200
if you can access these three things

1070
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,070
of epinephrin, acetylcholine
from these two sources,

1071
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,740
not only will the nervous
system change, it has to change.

1072
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,180
It absolutely will change.

1073
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,900
And that is the most important thing

1074
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,790
for people to understand if
they want to change their brain.

1075
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,560
You cannot just passively
experience things

1076
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,440
and repetition can be important,

1077
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,960
but the way to use repetition
to change your brain

1078
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,570
is fundamentally different.

1079
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,980
So now let's talk about
how we would translate

1080
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,500
all the scientific information and history

1081
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,900
into some protocols that
you can actually apply,

1082
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,740
because I think that's what
many of you're interested in.

1083
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,400
And I'm willing to bet that
most of you are not interested

1084
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,760
in lowering electrodes
into your nucleus basalis

1085
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,340
and frankly, neither am I.

1086
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,060
In episode one of the
Huberman Lab Podcast,

1087
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,530
I described the various
ways that people can monitor

1088
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,310
and change their nervous system.

1089
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,600
Those ways include brain
machine interface, pharmacology,

1090
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,500
behavioral practices,

1091
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,490
and those behavioral practices of course

1092
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,330
can include some dos, do this

1093
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,480
and some don'ts, don't do that, et cetera

1094
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,690
In thinking about neuroplasticity,

1095
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,270
I want to have a very frank conversation

1096
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,800
about what one can do

1097
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,930
but also acknowledge
this untapped capacity

1098
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,930
that I'm just not hearing about out there,

1099
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,380
which is one can also
combine behavioral practices

1100
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,580
with pharmacology.

1101
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,490
One can combine behavioral practices

1102
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,190
with brain machine interface,
and you don't have to do that.

1103
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,820
In fact, I'm not recommending
you do anything in particular.

1104
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,900
As always, I'll say it again,

1105
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,300
I'm not a physician, so I
don't prescribe anything.

1106
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,280
I'm a professor, so I
profess a lot of things.

1107
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,330
What you do with your health

1108
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,800
and your medical care is up to you.

1109
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,710
You're responsible for
your health and wellbeing.

1110
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,530
So I'm not going to tell you
what to do or what to take.

1111
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,350
I'm going to describe what
the literature tells us

1112
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,060
and suggests about ways
to access plasticity.

1113
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,680
We know we need epinephrin,
that means alertness.

1114
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,030
Most people accomplish this
through a cup of coffee

1115
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,180
and a good night's sleep.

1116
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,900
So I will say you should
master your sleep schedule

1117
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,270
and you should figure out
how much sleep you need

1118
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,143
in order to achieve alertness
when you sit down to learn.

1119
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,730
All the tools and more
science than probably

1120
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,580
you ever wanted to hear about sleep

1121
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,820
and how to get better at
sleeping and timing your sleep

1122
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,810
et cetera and naps and all of that

1123
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,840
is in episodes two, three, four, and five

1124
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,040
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1125
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,760
So I encourage you to refer to those

1126
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,310
if your sleep is not where
you would like it to be.

1127
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,510
Your ability to engage in
deliberate focused alertness

1128
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,290
is in direct proportion to
how well you are sleeping

1129
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,390
on a regular basis.

1130
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,270
I think that's kind of an obvious one.

1131
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,200
So get your sleep handled.

1132
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,610
But once that's in place,

1133
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,000
the question then is how
do I access this alertness?

1134
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,430
Well, there are a number of ways.

1135
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,970
Some people use some pretty elaborate

1136
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,490
psychological gymnastics.

1137
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,460
They will tell people that
they're going to do something

1138
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,150
and create some accountability.

1139
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,370
That could be really good.

1140
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,500
Or they'll post a picture
of themselves online

1141
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,540
and they'll commit to
learning a certain amount

1142
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,130
losing, excuse me, a
certain amount of weight

1143
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,300
or something like this.

1144
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,760
So they can use either
shame-based practices

1145
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,310
to potentially embarrass themselves

1146
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,340
if they don't follow through.

1147
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,430
They'll write cheques to
organizations that they hate

1148
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,800
and insist that they'll cash them

1149
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,650
if they don't actually follow through

1150
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,100
or they'll do it out of love,

1151
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,510
you know, they'll decide
that they're going

1152
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:54,110
to run a marathon or learn
a language or something

1153
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,410
because of somebody they love

1154
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,580
or they want to devote it to somebody.

1155
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,090
The truth is that from the
standpoint of epinephrin

1156
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,920
and getting alert and activated,
it doesn't really matter.

1157
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,610
Epinephrin is a chemical and
your brain does not distinguish

1158
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,710
between doing things out of
love or hate, anger or fear.

1159
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,530
It really doesn't, all of
those promote autonomic arousal

1160
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,760
and the release of epinephrin.

1161
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,350
So I think for most people

1162
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:20,750
if you're feeling not
motivated to make these changes

1163
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,130
the key thing is to identify not just one

1164
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,680
but probably at kit of reasons,
several reasons as to why

1165
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,830
you would want to make
this particular change

1166
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,680
and being drawn toward a particular goal

1167
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,220
that you're excited about can be one,

1168
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,060
also being motivated to not
be completely afraid, ashamed,

1169
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,500
or humiliated for not following through

1170
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,420
on a goal is another.

1171
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,960
I just want to briefly
mention one little aside there

1172
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,840
because I've got a
friend who's a physician,

1173
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,430
he's a cardiologist who has
a really interesting theory.

1174
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,120
This is just theory, but
I think it will resonate

1175
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,400
with a lot of people, which is that,

1176
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,150
you've all heard of this molecule dopamine

1177
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,750
that gives us the sense of reward

1178
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,140
when we accomplish something.

1179
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,850
Well, we also want to be
able to access dopamine

1180
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:01,050
while we're working towards things,

1181
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,770
enjoy the process as they say,

1182
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,810
'cause it has all sorts
of positive effects

1183
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:06,340
gives us energy, et cetera.

1184
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,460
With my friend, what he says is, you know,

1185
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,739
there's many many instances
where someone will come to him

1186
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:13,830
and say, "You know what,
I'm going to write a book."

1187
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,360
And he says, "Oh, that's great.

1188
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,630
I'm sure the book's going to be terrific

1189
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,920
and you really should write a book."

1190
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,940
And then they never go do it.

1191
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,220
And his theory is, if
you get so much dopamine

1192
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,990
from the reward of people saying,

1193
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,940
Oh yeah, you're absolutely
going to be able to do that,

1194
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,430
you might not actually go after the reward

1195
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,050
of the accomplishment itself.

1196
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,160
So be aware these positive
reinforcements also.

1197
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,250
I'm not saying people
should flagellate themselves

1198
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,880
to the point of victory in
whatever they're pursuing,

1199
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,380
but motivation is a tricky one.

1200
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,520
So I suggest that everyone asks themselves

1201
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,530
what is it that I want to accomplish?

1202
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,660
And what is it that's
driving me to accomplish this

1203
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,660
and come up with two or three things.

1204
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,440
Fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps

1205
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,460
or perhaps several of
those in order to ensure

1206
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,860
alertness, energy and
attention for the task.

1207
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,060
And that brings us to the attention part.

1208
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,780
Now it's one thing to
have an electrode embedded

1209
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,800
into your brain and increase
the amount of acetylcholine.

1210
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,630
It's another to exist in the real world

1211
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,840
outside the laboratory
and have trouble focusing.

1212
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,010
Having trouble bringing your attention

1213
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,580
to a particular location in
space for a particular event.

1214
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,510
And there's a lot of discussion
nowadays about smartphones

1215
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,253
and devices creating a
sort of attention deficit,

1216
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,210
almost at a clinical
level for many people,

1217
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,760
including adults.

1218
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,550
I think that's largely true.

1219
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,620
And what it means, however,
is that we all are responsible

1220
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,903
for learning how to create depth of focus.

1221
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,870
There are some important
Neuroscience principles

1222
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,810
to get depth of focus.

1223
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,040
I want to briefly talk
about the pharmacology first

1224
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,390
because I always get asked about this.

1225
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,620
People say, "What can I
take to increase my levels

1226
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,800
of acetylcholine?"

1227
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,560
Well, there are things you can take.

1228
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,210
Nicotine is called nicotine

1229
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,700
because acetylcholine binds
to the nicotinic receptor.

1230
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,460
There are two kinds of
acetylcholine receptors,

1231
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,520
muscarinic and nicotinic,

1232
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,960
but the nicotinic ones are involved

1233
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,693
in attention and alertness.

1234
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,210
I have colleagues, these
are not my, you know

1235
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,200
kind of like bro, science
buddies, I have those friends too,

1236
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,060
this is a Nobel prize winning colleague

1237
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,400
who chews Nicorette while he works.

1238
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,390
He used to be a smoker.

1239
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,800
He quit smoking because
of fear of lung cancer,

1240
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,260
seemed like a smart choice,

1241
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,910
but he missed the level of focus

1242
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,150
that he could bring to his work.

1243
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,110
This is somebody who has
had very long career.

1244
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,880
And if you ever meet with him,

1245
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,080
unfortunately I can't name him.

1246
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,740
If you ever meet with him
what you realize is he chews

1247
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,540
about five pieces of Nicorette an hour,

1248
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,830
which I am not suggesting people do.

1249
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,150
But when I asked him,
"Why are you doing this?"

1250
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:42,250
He said, "Well, increases
my alertness and focus."

1251
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,100
And also his theory and I
want to really underscore

1252
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,610
that it's theory not
scientifically supported yet,

1253
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,910
is that it offsets
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

1254
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,010
It is true that nucleus basalis

1255
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,910
is the primary site of
degeneration in the brain,

1256
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,370
in people that have
dementia and Parkinson's

1257
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,740
and it's what leads to
a lot of their inability

1258
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,640
to focus their attention, not
just deficits and plasticity.

1259
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,440
So he might be onto something.

1260
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,260
Now I've tried chewing Nicorette,
it makes me super jittery.

1261
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,620
I don't like it because
I can't focus very well.

1262
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,980
It kind of takes me too far up

1263
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,780
the level of autonomic arousal.

1264
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,060
I've got friends that
dip Nicorette all day,

1265
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,520
some of whom are scientists,
writers and artists

1266
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,360
and musicians are familiar
with the effects of nicotine

1267
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,220
from the era where a lot of people smoked

1268
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,680
and fortunately fewer people smoke now.

1269
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,690
So if you're interested
in the pharmacology,

1270
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,010
there are supplements and things

1271
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:34,810
that can increase cholinergic
transmission in the brain.

1272
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,970
I'm not suggesting you do this

1273
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,530
but if you're going to go down that route,

1274
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,780
you want to be very
careful how much you rely

1275
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,490
on those all the time.

1276
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:47,240
Because the essence of
plasticity is to create a window

1277
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,410
of attention and focus that's distinct

1278
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:50,550
from the rest of your day.

1279
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,740
That's what's going to
create a mark in your brain

1280
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,970
and the potential for plasticity.

1281
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,710
Things that increase acetylcholine,

1282
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,130
besides nicotine or Nicorette,

1283
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,930
the nicotine could come
from a variety of sources

1284
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,420
or things like alpha-GPC or choline.

1285
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,470
There are a number of these things.

1286
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,730
I would encourage you to go
to examine.com, the website

1287
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,100
and just put in acetylcholine

1288
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,050
and it will give you a list of supplements

1289
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,100
as well as some of the
dangers of these supplements

1290
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,310
that are associated with
cholinergic transmission.

1291
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,030
But I would be remiss and I would be lying

1292
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,610
if I didn't say that there
are a lot of people out there

1293
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:28,210
who are using cholinergic drugs

1294
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,200
in order to increase their level of focus.

1295
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,230
And since we're coming up on the Olympics,

1296
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,320
I don't want to get anyone in trouble

1297
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,920
but I'm well aware that
the fact that the sprinters

1298
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,980
are really into cholinergic drugs

1299
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,940
because not only is acetylcholine
important for the focus

1300
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,250
that allows them to hear the gun

1301
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,390
and be first out the
blocks on the sprints.

1302
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:49,100
That's a lot of where the race is won,

1303
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,700
hearing that gun and being
the quickest on reaction time.

1304
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,840
So they take cholinergic agents for that

1305
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,030
as well as acetylcholine is the molecule

1306
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,530
that controls nerve to muscle contraction.

1307
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,790
So your speed of reflexes
is actually controlled

1308
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,290
by this nicotinic transmission as well.

1309
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,800
So lots to think about
in terms of acetylcholine

1310
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,010
in sport and mental acuity,
not just plasticity.

1311
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,490
Now for most of you,

1312
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,230
you probably don't want to chew Nicorette,

1313
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,470
definitely don't want to smoke cigarettes

1314
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,400
or take supplements for
increasing acetylcholine.

1315
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,630
So what are some ways that you
can increase acetylcholine?

1316
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,490
And there, it's going to sound

1317
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,870
like a bit of a circular argument
but you to increase focus.

1318
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,730
How do you increase focus?

1319
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,840
You know, people are so
familiar with sitting down,

1320
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,130
reading a couple pages of a book

1321
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:33,640
and realizing that none of it sunk in

1322
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,620
or talking to someone and
seeing their mouth move,

1323
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,770
maybe even nodding your
head subconsciously

1324
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,380
and none of it sinks in.

1325
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,060
This can be very damaging
for school, work performance

1326
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,293
and relationships as many of you know.

1327
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,980
Costello incidentally never
seems to pay attention

1328
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,450
to anything I say while
looking directly at me,

1329
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,150
which contradicts what I'm about to say,

1330
00:53:55,150 --> 00:54:00,000
which is that the best way
to get better at focusing

1331
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,460
is to use the mechanisms of
focus that you were born with.

1332
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,360
And the key principle
here is that mental focus

1333
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,313
follows visual focus.

1334
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,760
We are all familiar with the
fact that our visual system

1335
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,460
can be unfocused, blurry or jumping around

1336
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,440
or we can be very laser focused
on one location in space.

1337
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,870
What's interesting and vitally important

1338
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,620
to understanding how to
access neuroplasticity

1339
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,430
is that you can use your visual focus

1340
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,630
and you can increase your
visual focus as a way

1341
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:37,050
of increasing your mental
focus abilities more broadly.

1342
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,800
So I'm going to explain how to do that.

1343
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,730
Plasticity starts with alertness.

1344
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,090
And as I mentioned before,

1345
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,260
that alertness can come
from a sense of love,

1346
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,433
a sense of joy, a sense
of fear, doesn't matter.

1347
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,720
There are pharmacologic ways
to access alertness too.

1348
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,530
The most common one is of course caffeine

1349
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,380
which if you watch the sleep episodes,

1350
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,140
you know reduces this molecule

1351
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,510
that makes us sleepy called adenosine.

1352
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,670
I drink plenty of caffeine.

1353
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,200
I'm a heavy user of caffeine.

1354
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,060
I don't think abuser of caffeine.

1355
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,170
I think in reasonable amounts

1356
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,200
provided we can still
fall asleep at night,

1357
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,250
caffeine can be a relatively safe way

1358
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,663
to increase epinephrin.

1359
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,980
Now, many people are
now also using Adderall.

1360
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,470
Adderall chemically looks
a lot like amphetamine

1361
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,930
and basically it is amphetamine.

1362
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:30,350
It will increase epinephrin
release from locus coeruleus,

1363
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,890
it will wake up the brain

1364
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,660
and that's why a lot of people rely on it.

1365
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,470
It does have a heavy basis for use

1366
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,810
in certain clinical syndromes prescribed

1367
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,110
such as attention deficit.

1368
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:47,530
However, it also has a
high probability of abuse

1369
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,060
especially in those who
are not prescribed it.

1370
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,660
Adderall will not increase
focus, it increases alertness.

1371
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,360
It does not touch the
acetylcholine system.

1372
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,807
And if those of you that
are taking Adderall say,

1373
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:01,540
"Well, it really increases
my focus overall",

1374
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,930
that's probably because your
autonomic nervous system

1375
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:06,840
is just veering towards what
we call parasympathetic.

1376
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,370
You're really just very sleepy

1377
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,150
and so it's bringing your
levels of alertness up.

1378
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,630
As I mentioned, Adderall
is very problematic

1379
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,700
for a number of people as
it can be habit forming.

1380
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,610
Learning on Adderall
does not always translate

1381
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,570
to high-performance off or
on Adderall at later times.

1382
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,200
And the Adderall
discussion is a broader one

1383
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,790
that perhaps we should have
with a psychiatrist in the room

1384
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:32,270
at some point because it is
a very widely abused drug

1385
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,513
at this point in time.

1386
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,310
The acetylcholine system

1387
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,830
and the focus that it brings is available

1388
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,410
as I mentioned through pharmacology,

1389
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,690
but also through these
behavioral practices.

1390
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,740
And the behavioral practices

1391
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,700
that are anchored in visual
focus are going to be the ones

1392
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,850
that are going to allow
you to develop great depth

1393
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,800
and duration of focus.

1394
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,570
So let's think about
visual focus for a second.

1395
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:01,230
When we focus on something
visually, we have two options.

1396
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:04,820
We can either look at a
very small region of space

1397
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,660
with a lot of detail
and a lot of precision

1398
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,360
or we can dilate our gaze
and we can see big pieces

1399
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,300
of visual space with very little detail.

1400
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,133
It's a trade-off.

1401
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:15,270
We can't look at everything
at high resolution.

1402
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,510
This is why we have these,

1403
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,940
the pupil more or less relates
to the fovea of the eye

1404
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,100
which is the area in which
we have the most receptors,

1405
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,070
the highest density of
receptors that perceive light.

1406
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,710
And so our acuity is much better

1407
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,880
in the center of our visual
field than our periphery.

1408
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,330
It's a simple experiment
you can do right now.

1409
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,020
If you're listening to
this, you can still do it.

1410
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,910
You can hold your feet or your
hands out in front of you.

1411
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,610
Provided that you're sighted
you should be able to see

1412
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,600
how many fingers you have in front of you.

1413
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,433
For me, it's five.

1414
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:42,033
I still got all five
fingers, amazingly enough.

1415
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,900
If I move my hand off to the side,

1416
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,720
I can't see them with precision,

1417
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,040
but as I moved them back into
the center of my visual field

1418
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,510
I can see them with precision.

1419
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,150
And that's because the density,

1420
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,080
the number of pixels in the
center of my visual field

1421
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,370
is much higher than it
is in the periphery.

1422
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,290
When we focus our eyes,
we do a couple of things.

1423
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,290
First of all, we tend to do that

1424
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,540
in the center of our visual field

1425
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,010
and our two eyes tend to align

1426
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,390
in what's called a vergence eye movement

1427
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,520
towards a common point.

1428
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,840
The other thing that happens
is the lens of our eye moves

1429
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,660
so that our brain now no longer
sees the entire visual world

1430
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:18,031
but is seeing a small
cone of visual imagery.

1431
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:19,609
[door banging]
If it...

1432
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:22,610
That was the dog bumping
into the wall, forgive me.

1433
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:24,820
That small cone of visual imagery

1434
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,720
or soda straw view of the
world has much higher acuity,

1435
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,663
higher resolution than if I
were to look at everything.

1436
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,900
Now you see, of course,
this makes perfect sense

1437
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,410
but that's about visual
attention, not mental attention.

1438
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:41,390
Well, it turns out that focus in the brain

1439
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,880
is anchored to our visual system.

1440
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,420
I'll talk about blind people in a moment

1441
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,070
but assuming that somebody is sighted,

1442
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,330
the key is to learn how
to focus better visually,

1443
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:55,000
if you want to bring about
higher levels of cognitive

1444
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,550
or mental focus, even if you're
engaged in a physical task.

1445
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:02,500
Now there's a remarkable
phenomenon in animals

1446
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,780
where animals that have their
eyes on the side of their head

1447
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,250
are scanning the entire visual
environment all the time.

1448
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,340
They're not focused on anything.

1449
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,640
Think you're grazing animals,
your cows, your sheep

1450
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,120
your birds, et cetera.

1451
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,390
But think about a bird
picking up seeds on the beach

1452
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,130
or on concrete.

1453
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,430
That bird's head is up here.

1454
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,010
It's up about a foot off the ground,

1455
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,700
or if it's a small bird about
six inches off the ground

1456
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,440
and its eyes are on the side of its head

1457
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,870
and yet it has this tiny beak

1458
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,280
that can quickly pick up these
little seeds off the ground

1459
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,470
with immense precision.

1460
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,310
Now, if you try to do that by staring off

1461
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,380
to the sides of the room
and picking up items

1462
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,260
in front of you with high
precision at that tiny scale,

1463
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,300
little tiny objects, you
will miss almost every time.

1464
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,580
They do it perfectly and
they don't smash their beak

1465
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,580
into the ground and damage it,

1466
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,490
they do it with beautiful
movement acuity also.

1467
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,910
So how do they do it?

1468
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:55,340
How do they create this
focus or this awareness

1469
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,180
of what's in front of them?

1470
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,800
It turns out as they lower their head,

1471
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,220
their eyes, very briefly move inward,

1472
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,310
in what's called a vergence eye movement.

1473
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,960
Now their eyes can't actually
translocate in their head,

1474
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,550
they're fixed in the skull,
just like yours and mine are.

1475
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,970
But when we move our eyes slightly inward,

1476
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,180
maybe you can tell and do it's like so

1477
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:21,160
basically shortening or making
the inter pupillary distance

1478
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,170
as it's called smaller.

1479
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,070
Two things happen.

1480
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:27,300
Not only do we develop
a smaller visual window

1481
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:31,150
into the world, but we
activate a set of neurons

1482
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,000
in our brainstem that trigger the release

1483
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,130
of both norepinephrine,
epinephrin and acetylcholine.

1484
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,300
Norepinephrine is kind
of similar to epinephrin.

1485
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,610
So in other words, when our
eyes are relaxed in our head

1486
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:44,470
when we're just kind of looking

1487
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:46,610
at our entire visual environment,
moving our head around,

1488
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,630
moving through space we're in optic flow,

1489
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,240
things moving past us
or we're sitting still,

1490
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,820
we're looking broadly at
our space, we're relaxed.

1491
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,240
When our eyes move slightly inward

1492
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,150
toward a particular visual target

1493
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:03,000
our visual world shrinks, our
level of visual focus goes up

1494
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,110
and we know that this relates

1495
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:07,780
to the release of
acetylcholine and epinephrin

1496
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,870
at the relevant sites in
the brain for plasticity.

1497
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,170
Now, what this means is that

1498
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,600
if you have a hard time focusing your mind

1499
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,430
for sake of reading or for
listening, you need to practice

1500
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,860
and you can practice
focusing your visual system.

1501
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,420
Now this works best if you practice

1502
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,500
focusing your visual system
at the precise distance,

1503
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,680
from the work that you intend
to do for sake of plasticity.

1504
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,920
So how would this look in the real world?

1505
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,260
Let's say, I am trying to
concentrate on something

1506
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,240
related to, I don't know, science,

1507
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,060
I'm reading a science paper
and I'm having a hard time,

1508
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,880
it's not absorbing.

1509
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,190
I might think that I'm
only looking at the paper

1510
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,023
that I'm reading.

1511
01:01:46,023 --> 01:01:47,020
I'm only looking at my screen,

1512
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,470
but actually my eyes are
probably darting around a bit.

1513
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,060
Experiments have been done on this.

1514
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,028
Or I'm gathering information
from too many sources

1515
01:01:54,028 --> 01:01:55,890
in the visual environment.

1516
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,820
Now, presumably because it's me,

1517
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,900
I've already had my coffee, I'm hydrated.

1518
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,980
I'm well rested, I slept well.

1519
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,160
And I still experienced
these challenges in focusing

1520
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,160
spending just 60 to 120 seconds
focusing my visual attention

1521
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,960
on a small window of my screen,

1522
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,760
meaning just on my screen
with nothing on it,

1523
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,130
but bringing my eyes to
that particular location

1524
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:22,360
increases not just my visual
acuity for that location

1525
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,530
but it brings about an
increase in activity

1526
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,870
in a bunch of other brain
areas that are associated

1527
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:33,400
with gathering information
from this location.

1528
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,080
So put simply, if you want to
improve your ability to focus

1529
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,120
practice visual focus.

1530
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,430
Now, if you wear contacts

1531
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:45,080
or you wear corrective
lenses, that's fine.

1532
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,540
You of course would want to use those.

1533
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,040
You don't want to take those
off and use a blurry image.

1534
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,260
The finer the visual image
and the more that you can hold

1535
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,070
your gaze to the visual image,

1536
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:58,360
the higher your levels
of attention will be.

1537
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,710
Many times on Instagram
and here I've been teased

1538
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,120
for not blinking very often.

1539
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,010
That's actually a practiced thing.

1540
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:07,160
We blink more as we get
tired, which as you hear it

1541
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,640
you'll probably just say, duh.

1542
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,230
As we get tired, the
neurons in the brainstem

1543
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,810
that are responsible for alertness

1544
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,600
and that hold the eyelids open

1545
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,880
start to falter and our
eyelids start to close.

1546
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,457
This is why it's hard, the words,

1547
01:03:18,457 --> 01:03:20,320
"I could barely keep my eyes open"

1548
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,050
which may be how you feel right now.

1549
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:25,000
But assuming that you're paying
attention and you're alert,

1550
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,020
when you're very alert,
your eyes are wide,

1551
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,510
your eyes are open.

1552
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,260
And as you get tired, your
eyelids start to close.

1553
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:36,570
Blinks, actually reset our
perception of time and space.

1554
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,720
This was shown in a beautiful
paper in Current Biology.

1555
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,640
I'll be sure to post the
reference in the notes.

1556
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,250
And blinking of course is
necessary to lubricate the eyes.

1557
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,470
People blink because
their eyes might get dry.

1558
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:51,270
But if you can keep
focused by blinking less

1559
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,440
and by focusing your eyes
to a particular location

1560
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,340
that's probably pretty
creepy for you to experience

1561
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,430
as I'm doing this.

1562
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,970
But the more that you can do this

1563
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:00,760
the more that you can
maintain a kind of a cone

1564
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,980
or a tunnel of mental focus.

1565
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,910
And so I'm sort of revealing my practice

1566
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:09,320
which is that I've worked very
hard through blinking contest

1567
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,990
with my 14-year-old niece
who still beats me every time

1568
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,940
and it really bothers me,

1569
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,780
but also just through my own self practice

1570
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,600
of learning to blink less
and focus my visual attention

1571
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,060
on a smaller region of space.

1572
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,810
Now for me, that's important

1573
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:26,980
because I'm mainly learning
things on a computer screen.

1574
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,510
If you're going to be doing
sport, it's quite a bit different

1575
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,660
and we can discuss how you might
translate to that to sport.

1576
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,500
In fact, in the next episode,
I'm going to talk all about

1577
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,610
how plasticity and the
focus mechanisms relate

1578
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:40,920
to learning of movement practices
and coordinated movements.

1579
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,920
It's an entire discussion unto itself

1580
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,070
but the same principle holds.

1581
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,970
So we need alertness.

1582
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:50,280
You can get that through
mental tricks of motivation,

1583
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,580
fear or love, whatever it is,

1584
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,470
pharmacology, please do it healthfully.

1585
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:57,760
You know, caffeine if
that's in your practice,

1586
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,420
certainly want to be well hydrated

1587
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:02,360
that increases actually
will increase alertness.

1588
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,190
Well, having a very full
bladder will increase alertness

1589
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,890
although you don't want
your alertness to be so high

1590
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:08,170
that all you can think about

1591
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,200
is the fact that you have to go urinate

1592
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,610
'cause that's very distracting.

1593
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,083
You don't want your alertness
to go through the roof.

1594
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,190
You need focus and visual
focus is the primary way

1595
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,330
in which we start to deploy
these neurochemicals.

1596
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:24,870
Now you may ask, well,
what about the experiment

1597
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,190
where people were feeling
this rotating drum

1598
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,470
or listening to the auditory cue

1599
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:30,800
that doesn't involve vision at all?

1600
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,050
If you look at people
who are learning things

1601
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:35,280
with their auditory system,

1602
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,860
they will often close their eyes.

1603
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,410
And that's not a coincidence.

1604
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:41,820
If somebody is listening very
hard, please don't ask them

1605
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,100
to look you directly in the eye

1606
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,030
while also asking that they listen to you.

1607
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:46,440
That's actually one of the worst ways

1608
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,273
to get somebody to listen to you.

1609
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:49,600
If you say, now listen to
me and look me in the eye.

1610
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,800
The visual system will take over

1611
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,950
and they'll see your mouth move,

1612
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:53,090
but they're going to hear their thoughts

1613
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,740
more than they're going to
hear what you're saying.

1614
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,040
Closing the eyes is one of the best ways

1615
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,660
to create a cone of auditory attention.

1616
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,260
And this is what low vision
or no vision folks do.

1617
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,110
They have tremendous capacity
to focus their attention

1618
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:08,160
in particular locations.

1619
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,410
Incidentally does anyone
know the two animals

1620
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:12,940
that have the best hearing in the world?

1621
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,760
The absolute best hearing
is many orders of magnitude

1622
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,140
better than humans.

1623
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,530
It turns out it's the elephant.

1624
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:21,010
That might not surprise
you, they have huge ears

1625
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,020
and the moth which
probably will surprise you.

1626
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,300
I didn't even know that moths could hear.

1627
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,773
but now it explains why
they're so hard to catch.

1628
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,900
If you are not sighted,
you learn how to do this

1629
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,970
with your hearing.

1630
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,230
If you're somebody who braille reads,

1631
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,890
you learn how to do
this with your fingers.

1632
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:42,890
If you look at great piano
players like Glenn Gould,

1633
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,730
they often times will turn
their head to the side.

1634
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:50,430
You think about some
of the great musicians

1635
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:53,550
like Stevie Wonder that were blind, right?

1636
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,370
He would look away
because he had no reason

1637
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,790
to look at the keys, but
oftentimes they'll orient an ear

1638
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,270
or one side of their head
to the keys on the piano.

1639
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:03,050
As I mentioned before,
people who are non-sighted

1640
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:03,883
have better pitch.

1641
01:07:03,883 --> 01:07:06,710
So we have these cones of
attention that we can devote.

1642
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,370
And for most people,
vision is the primary way

1643
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,040
to train up this focus of
building these cones of attention.

1644
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,640
So you absolutely have to focus

1645
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,220
on the thing that you're trying to learn.

1646
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,500
And you will feel some agitation

1647
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,160
because of the epinephrin in your system.

1648
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,027
If you're feeling agitation
and it's challenging to focus

1649
01:07:23,027 --> 01:07:24,760
and you're feeling like
you're not doing it right

1650
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,860
chances are you're doing it right.

1651
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,730
And you can practice this ability to stare

1652
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,890
for long periods of time without blinking.

1653
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:34,080
I know it's a little
eerie for people to watch,

1654
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,100
but if your goal is to
learn how to control

1655
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,170
that visual window for sake
of controlling your focus,

1656
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:41,390
it can be an immensely powerful portal

1657
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,490
into these mechanisms of plasticity,

1658
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,587
because we know it engages
things like nucleus basalis

1659
01:07:46,587 --> 01:07:49,120
and these other brainstem mechanisms.

1660
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,420
I get a lot of questions
about attention deficit

1661
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,760
hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,

1662
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,070
and attention deficit disorder.

1663
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:59,580
Some people actually have
clinically diagnosed ADD and ADHD.

1664
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,930
And if you do, you should certainly work

1665
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:04,150
with a good psychiatrist
to try and figure out

1666
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:08,190
the right pharmacology and/or
behavioral practices for you.

1667
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:12,730
Many people, however, have given
themselves a low grade ADHD

1668
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,150
or ADD because of the way that they move

1669
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,890
through their world.

1670
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,450
They are looking at their
phone a lot of the time.

1671
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,260
It's actually very easy
to anchor your attention

1672
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,830
to your phone for the following reason.

1673
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:25,560
First of all, it's very
restricted in size.

1674
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,029
So it's very easy to limit
your visual attention

1675
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:30,319
to something about this big.

1676
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,869
It's one of the design
features of the phone.

1677
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,830
The other, is that just
as you've probably heard

1678
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:39,040
a picture is worth a thousand words,

1679
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,790
well, a movie is worth 10,000 pictures.

1680
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,510
Anytime we're looking at
things that have motion,

1681
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:48,000
visual motion, our attentional system

1682
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,020
will naturally gravitate towards
them, towards those movies.

1683
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:55,120
It's actually much harder
to read words on a page

1684
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,430
than it used to be for many people,

1685
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:00,529
because we're used to seeing
things spelled out for us

1686
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:01,833
in YouTube videos or videos

1687
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:05,950
where things move in a very dramatic.

1688
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,689
It is true that the more that we look

1689
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:10,059
at those motion stimulate,

1690
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,529
the more that we're
seeing movies of things

1691
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:14,699
and things that are very
dramatic and very intense,

1692
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,120
the worst we're getting
at attending to things

1693
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,319
like text on a page or
to listening to something

1694
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:23,659
like a podcast and
extracting the information

1695
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,577
so much so that I think
many people have asked me,

1696
01:09:26,577 --> 01:09:29,470
"Hey you know what, why aren't
you providing intense visuals

1697
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,303
for us to look at?"

1698
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:31,580
Well, frankly, it's
because a lot of people

1699
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,200
are consuming this content
through pure auditory,

1700
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,529
through, it's by listening.

1701
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:38,439
And I want them to be able
to digest all the material.

1702
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:39,969
But in addition to that,

1703
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,620
if you think about the areas of life

1704
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:45,010
that dictate whether or
not we become successful,

1705
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,453
independent, healthy individuals,

1706
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,729
most of those involve the
kind of boring practices

1707
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:55,350
of digesting information on a page.

1708
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:58,530
Boring because it's not as
exciting in the moment perhaps

1709
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:02,730
as watching a movie or
something being spoonfed to us.

1710
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:04,790
But the more attention that
we can put to something,

1711
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,530
even if it's fleeting and we feel like

1712
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:08,360
we're only getting little bits and pieces,

1713
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,680
shards of the information as
opposed to the entire thing,

1714
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,400
that has a much more powerful effect

1715
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,460
in engaging this cholinergic
system for plasticity

1716
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,350
than does, for instance, watching a movie.

1717
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,500
And that's because when we watch a movie,

1718
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,560
the entire thing can be
great, it can be awesome.

1719
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,280
It can be this overriding experience

1720
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,220
but I think for all those experiences,

1721
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,750
if you're somebody who's
interested in building your brain

1722
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,620
and expanding your brain

1723
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,540
and getting better at various things,

1724
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,370
in feeling better,
doing better, et cetera,

1725
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,900
one has to ask how much of
my neurochemical resources

1726
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,150
am I devoting to the passive experience

1727
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,330
of letting something,
just kind of overwhelm me

1728
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:46,710
and excite me,

1729
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,480
versus something that I'm
really trying to learn

1730
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,560
and take away.

1731
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,393
And now there's another

1732
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:53,530
I enjoy movie content and
TV content all the time.

1733
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:55,770
I scroll Instagram often.

1734
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,410
But we are limited in the extent
to which we can grab a hold

1735
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,780
of these acetylcholine release
mechanisms or epinephrin.

1736
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,350
And I think that we need to be careful

1737
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:10,420
that we don't devote all our
acetylcholine and epinephrin,

1738
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,240
all our dopamine for that matter

1739
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,260
to these passive experiences of things

1740
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:17,120
that are not going to
enrich us and better us.

1741
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,110
So that's a little bit of
an editorial on my part

1742
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,850
but the phone is rich with movies,

1743
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,150
it's rich with information.

1744
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:26,610
The real question is

1745
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:31,610
is the information rich
for us in ways that grow us

1746
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:36,680
and cultivate smarter,
more emotionally, you know

1747
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,500
emotionally evolved
people, or is it creating

1748
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,480
what's it doing for our physical
wellbeing for that matter?

1749
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,960
So I don't want to tell
people what to do or not to do

1750
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,990
but think carefully about
how often you're focusing

1751
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:53,710
on something and how good
you are or poor you are

1752
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,790
at focusing on something
that's challenging.

1753
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,850
So once you get this
epinephrin, this alertness,

1754
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,940
you get the acetylcholine released

1755
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,090
and you can focus your attention.

1756
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,690
Then the question is for how long?

1757
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:06,180
And in an earlier podcast,

1758
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,910
I talked about these ultradian cycles

1759
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:09,670
that lasts about 90 minutes.

1760
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:12,700
The typical learning about
should be about 90 minutes.

1761
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,180
I think that learning about will no doubt

1762
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:18,610
include five to 10
minutes of warmup period.

1763
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,850
I think everyone should
give themselves permission

1764
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:24,400
to not be fully focused in
the early part of that about.

1765
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,280
But that in the middle of that about

1766
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,260
for the middle hour or so

1767
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,880
you should be able to maintain focus

1768
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,270
for about an hour or so.

1769
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,920
So that for me means
eliminating distractions.

1770
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,770
That means turning off the wifi.

1771
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,390
I put my phone in the other room.

1772
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,580
If I find myself reflexively
getting up to get the phone

1773
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,730
I will take the phone and
lock it in the car outside.

1774
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,890
If I find myself going to get it anyway,

1775
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:48,550
I am guilty of giving away
the phone for a period of time

1776
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:50,860
or even things more dramatic,

1777
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,740
I've thrown it up on my roof before

1778
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,770
so I can't get to it
till the end of the day.

1779
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,260
That thing is pretty compelling

1780
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,630
and we come up with all sorts of reasons

1781
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,550
why we need it, to be in contact with it

1782
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,280
but I encourage you to try experiencing

1783
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,420
what it is to be completely
immersed in an activity

1784
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,960
where you feel the agitation
that your attention is drifting

1785
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,530
but you continually bring it back.

1786
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,720
And that's an important point

1787
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,830
which is that attention drifts,
but we have to re-anchor it.

1788
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:15,310
We have to keep grabbing it back.

1789
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:18,210
And the way to do that, if
you're sighted is with your eyes.

1790
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,010
That as your attention
drifts, and you look away

1791
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,250
you want to try and literally
maintain visual focus

1792
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,630
on the thing that you're trying to learn.

1793
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,220
Feel free to blink, of course,

1794
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,770
but you can greatly increase
your powers of focus

1795
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:31,310
and the rates of learning
which is anchored

1796
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,570
in all the work of Merzenich,
Hubel and Wiesel and others.

1797
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,120
Now that's the trigger for plasticity,

1798
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,760
but the real secret is
that neuroplasticity

1799
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,460
doesn't occur during wakefulness.

1800
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,560
It occurs during sleep.

1801
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,560
We now know that if you
focus very hard on something

1802
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,060
for about 90 minutes or so,

1803
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,150
maybe you even do several
bouts of that per day.

1804
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:58,630
If you can do that, some people can,

1805
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,970
some people can only do one
focus about of learning,

1806
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,810
that night and the following
nights, while you're asleep

1807
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,760
the neural circuits that
were highlighted if you will

1808
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,640
with acetylcholine
transmission will strengthen

1809
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,760
and other will be lost,

1810
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,800
which is wonderful because
that's the essence of plasticity.

1811
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,540
And what it means is that
when you eventually wake up

1812
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:19,750
a couple of days or a week later,

1813
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:22,550
you will will have acquired
the knowledge forever

1814
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,827
unless you go through some
process to actively unlearn it.

1815
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:27,733
And we will talk about
unlearning in a later episode.

1816
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:30,870
So mastering sleep is key

1817
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,930
in order to reinforce
the learning that occurs.

1818
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,240
But let's say you get a
really poor night of sleep

1819
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,010
after a about of learning.

1820
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,450
Chances are, if you sleep the next night

1821
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,630
or the following night
that learning will occur.

1822
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,010
There's a stamp in the brain

1823
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,620
where this acetylcholine was released.

1824
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,580
It actually marks those
synapses neurochemically

1825
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,290
and metabolically, so
that those are synopses

1826
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:52,920
are more biased to change.

1827
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,160
Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep

1828
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,453
then you probably won't get those changes.

1829
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,610
There's also a way in which
you can bypass the need

1830
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,310
for deep sleep at least
partially by engaging

1831
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,470
in what I call Non Sleep Deep
Rest, these NSDR protocols.

1832
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,910
But I just want to
discuss the signs of this.

1833
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:13,040
There was a paper that was
published in Cell Reports

1834
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,150
last year that shows that if people did,

1835
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,700
it was a spatial memory task,
actually quite difficult one

1836
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,380
where they had to remember
the sequence of lights

1837
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,437
lighting up and if they're
just two or three lights

1838
01:15:21,437 --> 01:15:24,170
in a particular sequence it's easy

1839
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:26,900
but as you get up to 15 or 16 lights

1840
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,880
and numbers in the sequence

1841
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,930
it actually gets quite challenging.

1842
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,150
If immediately after,

1843
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,090
and it was immediately after the learning

1844
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,080
the actual performance of this task,

1845
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:42,080
people took a 20 minute Non
Sleep Deep Rest protocol

1846
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,940
or took a shallow nap, so lying down,

1847
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,630
feet slightly elevated perhaps,

1848
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,410
just closing their eyes, no sensory input,

1849
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,890
the rates of learning
were significantly higher

1850
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:56,440
for that information than
where the two just had

1851
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,260
a good night's sleep the following night.

1852
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,890
So you can actually accelerate learning

1853
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,480
with these NSDR protocols
or with brief naps,

1854
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,250
90 minutes or less.

1855
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:09,050
So the key to plasticity in
childhood is to be a child.

1856
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:13,320
The key to plasticity in
adulthood is to engage alertness,

1857
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:18,190
engage focus and then to
engage Non Sleep Deep Rest

1858
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:22,800
and deep sleep while you're in
your typical about of sleep.

1859
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,907
I always get asked,

1860
01:16:23,907 --> 01:16:26,410
"How many bouts of
learning can I perform?"

1861
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,980
Well, I know people that train up

1862
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,520
these visual focus mechanisms
to the point where they can do

1863
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,360
several 90 minute bouts
throughout the day,

1864
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,800
as many as three or four.

1865
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,130
And some of them are also inserting

1866
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,200
Non Sleep Deep Rest as well.

1867
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,560
Now that can get pretty tricky.

1868
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,080
A lot of people find that
they can recover best

1869
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,890
from these intense bouts
of focused learning

1870
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:51,590
by doing some motor activity

1871
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,950
where you get into
self-generated optic flow.

1872
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,170
And that should make sense

1873
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,870
if you've ever heard
me lecture about stress

1874
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,090
which I've done a little
bit in various podcasts.

1875
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:01,400
When we are in a mode of
self-generated optic flow

1876
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,920
like walking or running or cycling

1877
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,730
and things are just floating
past us on our retina,

1878
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,300
we're not really looking
anywhere in particular,

1879
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,030
so this is the opposite of
a tight window of focus.

1880
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,700
When we do that,

1881
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,740
there are areas of the
brain like the amygdala

1882
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:17,650
which are involved in releasing epinephrin

1883
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:18,840
and create alertness.

1884
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,650
At the extremes, it creates
fear but certainly alertness,

1885
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,880
those are all shut down.

1886
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,960
So it's its own form
of non sleep deep rest.

1887
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,640
So some people find it much
more pleasurable and practical

1888
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,360
to engage in a focused about of learning

1889
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,910
and then go do some activity that involves

1890
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,510
what we would essentially
call worldlessness

1891
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:40,220
where you're not really
thinking about much of anything.

1892
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,290
And so for those of you that listen

1893
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,500
to audio books or podcasts while you run

1894
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,760
you may want to consider whether or not

1895
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,400
that's how you want to
spend your time right now.

1896
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,060
I'd love it if you were
listening to this podcast

1897
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:52,380
while you run or cycle, but
I'm much more interested

1898
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,300
in you actually getting the
benefits of neuroplasticity

1899
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,140
than just listening to me for
the sake of listening to me.

1900
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:02,580
So for many people letting the mind drift

1901
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:04,760
where it's not organized in thought

1902
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,420
after a period of very
deliberate focused effort

1903
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,250
is the best way to accelerate learning

1904
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,110
and depth of learning.

1905
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:11,320
And there are good scientific data

1906
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,540
to support these sorts of things,

1907
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:14,180
including the Cell Reports paper

1908
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,340
that I mentioned a few moments ago.

1909
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,230
I want to synthesize
some of the information

1910
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:20,500
that we've covered up until now.

1911
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,230
This entire month is
about neuroplasticity.

1912
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,600
Today's episode has covered a lot,

1913
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,280
but by no means has it
covered all of the potential

1914
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,500
for neuroplasticity and
protocols for plasticity.

1915
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,270
We will get into all of it.

1916
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:37,560
But today I want to make
sure that these key elements

1917
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,060
that form the backbone of neuroplasticity

1918
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,580
are really embedded in people's minds.

1919
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:45,533
First of all, plasticity
occurs throughout the lifespan.

1920
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:49,630
Early, from birth until 25,

1921
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:54,330
mere exposure to a sensory
event can create plasticity.

1922
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,600
That could be a good thing or a bad thing.

1923
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,720
We're going to talk about
unlearning the bad stuff,

1924
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,333
traumas, et cetera in a
subsequent episode this month.

1925
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:08,920
If you want to learn as an
adult, you have to be alert.

1926
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,160
It might seem so obvious

1927
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,690
but I think a lot of
people don't think about

1928
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:15,913
when in their 24 hour
cycle, they're most alert.

1929
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:21,330
There are four episodes
devoted to that 24-hour cycle

1930
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:23,000
and the cycles of alertness and sleep.

1931
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,140
I encourage you to listen to those

1932
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,070
if you haven't had the opportunity to yet

1933
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:30,020
or just ask yourself when
during the day do you typically

1934
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,230
tend to be most alert?

1935
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,970
That will afford you an advantage

1936
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,950
in learning specific things
during that period of time.

1937
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,720
So don't give up that period of time

1938
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,280
for things that are meaningless, useless,

1939
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,040
or not aligned with your goals.

1940
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,260
That'd be a terrible time to
get into passive observance

1941
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,260
or just letting your time
get soaked away by something.

1942
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:54,600
That is a valuable asset, that epinephrin,

1943
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:58,840
released from your brainstem
is going to occur more readily

1944
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,580
at particular phases of your
24-hour cycle than others,

1945
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,370
during the waking phase of course.

1946
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,650
You should know when those are.

1947
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:10,220
And then you could start to think about

1948
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,190
the behavioral practices, maybe
the pharmacologic practices

1949
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:15,030
like caffeine, hydration, et cetera

1950
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:19,180
that will support heightened
levels of alertness.

1951
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,930
Attention is something that can be learned

1952
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:25,300
and attention is critical
for creating that condition

1953
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,250
where whatever it is
that you are engaging in

1954
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,450
will modify your brain in a way

1955
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,330
that you won't have to spend
so much attention on it

1956
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,163
going forward.

1957
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,290
That's the essence of plasticity,

1958
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:38,100
that things will eventually
become reflexive.

1959
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,640
The language that you're learning,

1960
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,480
the motor movement, the cognitive skill,

1961
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:44,530
the ability to suppress
an emotional response

1962
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:46,240
or to engage in emotional response

1963
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,417
depending on what your goals are

1964
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:49,003
and what's appropriate for you.

1965
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,710
Increasing acetylcholine
can be accomplished

1966
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,760
pharmacologically through nicotine.

1967
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,050
However, there are certain dangers

1968
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:00,830
for many people to do
that as well as the cost,

1969
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:01,893
financial cost,

1970
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,620
learning how to engage
the cholinergic system

1971
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,100
through the use of the visual system,

1972
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:10,030
practicing how long can you maintain focus

1973
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:12,133
with blinks as you need them,

1974
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,980
but how long can you maintain
visual focus on a target,

1975
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:20,290
just on a piece of paper set
a few feet away in the room

1976
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:22,020
or at the level of your computer screen.

1977
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,490
These are actually things
that people do in communities

1978
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:27,600
where high levels of
visual focus are necessary.

1979
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,570
Now, the other way to get
high levels of visual focus

1980
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,260
and alertness is to have a panic

1981
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,930
or to have a situation
that's very, very bad.

1982
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,020
You will be immediately
focused on everything

1983
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,650
related to that situation,
but that's unfortunate.

1984
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,720
What we're really talking
about here is trying to

1985
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,540
harness the mechanisms of attention

1986
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,580
and get better at paying attention.

1987
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,250
You may want to do that
with your auditory system,

1988
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,930
not with your visual system,

1989
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:51,310
either because you're
low vision or no vision,

1990
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:52,680
or because you're trying
to learn something

1991
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,650
that relates more to sounds
than to what you see.

1992
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:57,250
But for most people they're
trying to learn information,

1993
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,400
cognitive information, or
they're trying to learn how to

1994
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,970
hear the nuance in their
partner's explanations

1995
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:05,830
of their emotionally
challenging events, et cetera.

1996
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:08,080
And just remember, by the
way, what I said earlier,

1997
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,220
which is that if you really
want somebody to listen to you

1998
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:14,510
and really hear what you're
saying and what's underlying it,

1999
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:16,770
you should not, and cannot expect them

2000
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,360
to look directly at you while you do that.

2001
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,650
That's actually going to
limit their ability to focus.

2002
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:22,210
I'm trying to rescue a few folks out there

2003
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:24,360
who might be in this struggle.

2004
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,563
I of course have never
been in this struggle.

2005
01:22:28,231 --> 01:22:30,450
And that was supposed to be a joke.

2006
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,970
I'm very familiar with that struggle

2007
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:35,470
but I know that one can
get better at listening,

2008
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:37,210
one can get better at learning,

2009
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:39,014
one can get better at all sorts

2010
01:22:39,014 --> 01:22:42,110
of things by anchoring
in these mechanisms.

2011
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:44,640
Now, of course you can
also combine protocols.

2012
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:48,430
You can decide to combine pharmacology

2013
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,710
with these learning practices.

2014
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,360
Many people in communities do that.

2015
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,080
Many people are doing that naturally

2016
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,110
by drinking their coffee

2017
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:58,280
right before they do their learning.

2018
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,670
But I would also encourage
you to think about

2019
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,210
how long those learning bouts are.

2020
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:06,810
If you think you have ADD or ADHD,

2021
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:09,280
see a clinician but you
should also ask yourself

2022
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,240
are you giving up the best period of focus

2023
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,090
that you have each day naturally

2024
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,430
to some other thing like social media

2025
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:19,100
or some other activity
that doesn't serve you well

2026
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:22,913
or are you devoting that period
to the opportunity to learn?

2027
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,720
You should also ask
yourself whether or not

2028
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,393
you're trying to focus too much
for too long during the day.

2029
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,360
I know some very high
performing individuals,

2030
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,090
very high-performing in
a variety of contexts

2031
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,980
and none of them are focused all day long.

2032
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,180
Many of them take walks down the hallway,

2033
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,200
sometimes mumbling to themselves,

2034
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,960
they're not paying
attention to anything else.

2035
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,120
They go for bike rides, they take walks.

2036
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,410
They are not trying to engage their mind

2037
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,880
at maximum focus all the time.

2038
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,340
Very few people do that
because we learn best

2039
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,630
in these 90 minute bouts

2040
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,680
inside of one of these ultradian cycles.

2041
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,800
And I should repeat again, that
within that 90-minute cycle,

2042
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,360
you should not expect yourself to focus

2043
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,069
for the entire period
of one 90-minute cycle.

2044
01:24:03,069 --> 01:24:05,270
The beginning and end are
going to be a little bit

2045
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:06,850
flickering in and out of focus.

2046
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,060
How do you know when one
of these 90-minute cycles

2047
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:11,410
is starting, or typically when you wake up

2048
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,130
os the beginning of the
first 90-minute cycle,

2049
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,820
but it's not down to the minute.

2050
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,140
You'll be able to tap into your sense

2051
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,240
of these 90-minute cycles

2052
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,890
as you start to engage in
these learning practices

2053
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,440
should you choose.

2054
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,850
And then of course getting
some non sleep deep rest

2055
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,060
or just deliberate disengagement,

2056
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:30,070
such as walking or running,

2057
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:33,360
or just sitting, eyes closed or eyes open

2058
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,550
you kind of mindlessly
it might seem in a chair,

2059
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:36,910
just letting your thoughts move around

2060
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:39,580
after a learning about will accelerate

2061
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,760
the rate of plasticity

2062
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,513
that's been shown in quality
peer reviewed studies.

2063
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,750
And then of course, deep sleep.

2064
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,920
And so what we can start to see is that

2065
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,920
plasticity is your natural
right early in life.

2066
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:57,860
But after about age 25

2067
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,470
you have to do some work
in order to access it.

2068
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,300
But fortunately, these
beautiful experiments

2069
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,380
of Hubel and Wiesel and Merzenich
and Weinberger and others

2070
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:09,020
point in the direction of what allows us

2071
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,230
to achieve plasticity,

2072
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,660
it points to the neurochemicals
and the circuits.

2073
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,840
And we now have behavioral protocols

2074
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,090
that allow us to do that.

2075
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,740
I also really want to emphasize

2076
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:23,770
that there's an entire other
aspect of behavioral practices

2077
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:26,270
that will allow us to engage in plasticity

2078
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:29,930
that don't involve intense
focus on emotionality

2079
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,650
but involve a lot of repetition.

2080
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:35,950
So there's another entire
category of plasticity

2081
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:40,150
that involves doing what seemed
like almost mundane things

2082
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,170
but doing them over and
over again repeatedly

2083
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:47,180
and incorporating the reward
system that involves dopamine.

2084
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,180
So today I talked about
the kind of plasticity

2085
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,770
that comes from extreme focus.

2086
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,004
You would get that extreme
focus and alertness naturally

2087
01:25:53,004 --> 01:25:56,320
through a harder, difficult
event that you didn't want.

2088
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,530
That's the kind of stinger

2089
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:59,150
but your brain is
designed to keep you safe

2090
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,220
so it wants to get one trial learning

2091
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:03,020
from things like touching a hot stove

2092
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,413
or engaging with a really horrible person.

2093
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:12,430
You can get incredible plasticity
of positive experiences

2094
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:16,020
of things that you want by
engaging this high focus regime

2095
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,453
and then rest, non sleep
deep rest, and sleep.

2096
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,403
And there's another aspect of plasticity

2097
01:26:21,403 --> 01:26:24,430
which we will explore next episode

2098
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:28,010
as well as when we explore
movement-based practices

2099
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:32,520
for enhancing plasticity and
plasticity of movement itself.

2100
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,890
And those are not of the high attention

2101
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:37,580
kind of high emotionality

2102
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:41,170
or in the intensity of the experiences

2103
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,390
that I described today.

2104
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:45,980
Those are more about repetition
and reward and repeat,

2105
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:47,650
repetition, reward, repeat,

2106
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:51,420
and they are used for a
distinctly different category

2107
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:54,690
of behavioral change more
of which relate to habits

2108
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:58,750
as opposed to learning of
particular types of information

2109
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:03,330
that allow us to perform physically,

2110
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:06,620
cognitively or adjust
our emotional system.

2111
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,460
So I'm going to stop there.

2112
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,740
I'm sure there are a lot of questions.

2113
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,960
Please put your questions
in the comment section below

2114
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,950
and please remember that this entire month

2115
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:16,120
we're going to be
exploring neuroplasticity.

2116
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,490
So this discussion/lecture,

2117
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:21,950
I wish it was more of a back and forth,

2118
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,670
but this is what the format offers us.

2119
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:27,400
So please do put your questions
in the comment section

2120
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,500
and I will address them in
the other episodes coming soon

2121
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,460
on neuroplasticity.

2122
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,260
As I say that I'm reminded

2123
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:38,700
that many of you are listening
to this on Apple or Spotify

2124
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,370
and therefore there isn't an opportunity

2125
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:44,810
to leave comments aside from
the rating section on Apple.

2126
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:48,360
So if you have specific topics
related to neuroplasticity

2127
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,700
that you would like me to cover

2128
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,840
in the subsequent episodes this month

2129
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,710
please go to the YouTube, subscribe,

2130
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:58,070
but as well please put your
question in the comment section

2131
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:01,720
for this episode and I'll be
sure to read them and respond.

2132
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,570
Many of you have very graciously asked

2133
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:06,040
how you can help support
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2134
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:10,340
Best way to do that is
to subscribe on YouTube.

2135
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:12,500
You might want to also hit
the notification button

2136
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,460
so that you don't miss
any upcoming episodes.

2137
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:16,690
Leave a comment,

2138
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:20,180
as well if you go to Apple,
you can give us a 5-star rating

2139
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:21,890
and there's a place there where also

2140
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,230
you can leave a comment.

2141
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:24,950
And if you prefer to listen on Spotify

2142
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:27,450
subscribe and download on Spotify.

2143
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:29,080
In addition, it's always helpful

2144
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,690
if you recommend the podcast
to your friends and family

2145
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:35,000
and others who you think might
benefit from the information

2146
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,030
and as well, please
check out our sponsors.

2147
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,060
That's a great way to help us.

2148
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,170
Today and in previous episodes,

2149
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:44,710
I've talked a number of
times about supplements.

2150
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:47,210
I'm very pleased that we're
partnering with Thorne,

2151
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:49,860
T-h-o-r-n-e supplements

2152
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,170
because Thorne has the very
high levels of stringency

2153
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,210
in terms of product quality and precision

2154
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:59,930
about how much of given
supplements are in the bottle

2155
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,670
which is vital and not
all supplement companies

2156
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,360
have stood up to the test on that one.

2157
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,440
If you want to check out Thorne

2158
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:12,440
and go to Thorne that's
thorne.com/u/huberman.

2159
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:16,520
And if you do that, you'll get 20% off

2160
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,480
any supplements that you purchase.

2161
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,650
I've also listed there
a gallery of supplements

2162
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,330
that I take, including
magnesium glycinate.

2163
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:24,870
I know in previous episodes,

2164
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:27,020
I talked about magnesium threonate

2165
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,850
as a sleep aid that I take.

2166
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:31,580
magnesium glycinate
and magnesium threonate

2167
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,880
are essentially interchangeable.

2168
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,330
Thanks so much for your
time and attention,

2169
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:37,840
and as always thank you for
your interest in science.

2170
