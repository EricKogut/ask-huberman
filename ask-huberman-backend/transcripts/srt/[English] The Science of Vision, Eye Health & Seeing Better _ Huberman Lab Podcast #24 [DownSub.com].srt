00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,950
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,011
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:09,330
[gentle music]

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,250
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,380
of neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,250
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,970
This podcast is separate from my teaching

9
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,710
and research roles at Stanford.

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,910
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,200
to bring zero cost to consumer information

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,280
about science and science-related tools

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,970
to the general public.

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,370
In keeping with that theme,

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,410
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,270
Our first sponsor is Roka.

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,560
Founded by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,430
Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
have really been designed

19
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,610
with the utmost care
and the utmost attention

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,710
to the science of optics
and the visual system.

21
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,320
So one of the things I like so much

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,460
about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

23
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,640
is that they're extremely lightweight.

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,290
If you get sweaty, so for instance,

25
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,470
if you wear them while
running, or walking, or hiking,

26
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,030
they don't slip off.

27
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,510
And with the sunglasses,
when you're outdoors,

28
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,010
if there's cloud cover,
or if there's shadows,

29
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,700
or if the day gets brighter or dimmer,

30
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,230
you can still see your
surroundings perfectly well.

31
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,010
And that's because the designers at Roka

32
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,610
really understand the way
the visual system works

33
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,790
how it habituates, how it adapts.

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,980
You don't need to understand the science

35
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,440
behind all that, but they do,

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,520
and as a consequence the
eyeglasses perform extremely well

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
under all conditions,

38
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,510
whether or not that's indoors or outdoors.

39
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,910
So they put a ton of science
and purpose into the design.

40
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,400
They also happen to look really good.

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,060
They have a really nice aesthetic.

42
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,760
A lot of, as you know,
performance active wear eyeglasses

43
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,060
look rather ridiculous, but
the Roka glasses, I think,

44
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,740
have a very nice aesthetic to them

45
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,050
that you can wear anywhere.

46
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,650
If you'd like to check out Roka glasses,

47
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,740

53
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,660
Today's podcast is also brought
to us by Inside Tracker.

54
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,110
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

55
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,830
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

56
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,350
to help you better understand your body

57
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,230
and reach your health goals.

58
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,900
I'm a big believer in getting
regular blood work done

59
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,610
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

60
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,660
that impact our immediate
and longterm health

61
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,290
can only be analyzed from a blood test.

62
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,690
And now, with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

63
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,000
we can also get insight
into our specific DNA makeup

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,730
and how that influences
our lifestyle choices

65
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,990
and our health status.

66
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,740
The problem with a lot of blood tests

67
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,640
is that you get a lot of information back,

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,570
but you don't always know what
to do with that information.

69
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,870
With Inside Tracker, they
have a very easy to use,

70
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,260
personalized dashboard platform

71
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,040
that informs you what sorts of lifestyle,

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,900
nutrition, exercise, changes
you might want to make,

73
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,640
according to the levels of
particular metabolic factors,

74
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,580
hormone factors, et cetera,
in your blood and DNA.

75
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,130
So it makes everything very simple,

76
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,600
both in terms of where
you're at health-wise

77
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,030
and what you should or could do,

78
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,340
in order to improve your health,

79
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,590
something I do believe most
everybody would like to do.

80
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,730
With Inside Tracker, it
makes all that very easy.

81
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,980
They also have something
called the inner age test.

82
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,090
This is a test that shows
you what your biological age

83
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,720
and compares to that, of course,
to your chronological age.

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,130
And, of course, your biological age

85
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,300
is really what you want to know,

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,960
because it's a predictor of
how long you're going to live

87
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,720
and the quality of your life.

88
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,250
If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

89
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,440
you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman.

90
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,640
And if you do that, you'll get 25% off

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,410

just use the code Huberman at checkout.

93
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,030
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

94
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,140
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

95
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,080
that are ideally suited
to your sleep needs.

96
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,030
Everybody needs something different

97
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,420
in terms of what to sleep on.

98
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,970
Some people like a hard mattress.

99
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,240
Some people like a soft mattress.

100
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,580
Some people tend to run warm.

101
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,460
Some people tend to run cold.

102
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,500
With Helix Sleep, you go to their website,

103
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,890
you take a very brief two-minute quiz,

104
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,550
and you answer some questions such as,

105
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,840
do you tend to sleep on your stomach,

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,750
or your side, or your back?

107
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,583
Maybe you don't know.

108
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,780
Do you tend to run hot or cold, et cetera.

109
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,570
At the end of that quiz, you
match to a specific mattress.

110
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,220
I took that quiz about six months ago,

111
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,470
and I matched to the Dusk Mattress,

112
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,760
and I've been sleeping on
a Dusk mattress from Helix

113
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,720
for the last six months,

114
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,250
and I've been sleeping better
than I ever have before.

115
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Basically, everyone's unique,
and Helix understands that,

116
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,490
and that's built into the
design of their mattresses

117
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,459
and this two-minute quiz that
you take to match you to one.

118
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,530
If you'd like to try a
Helix Sleep mattress,

119
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,720
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,270
take their two-minute quiz,

121
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,540
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

122
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,450
You'll also get up to $200
off any mattress order

123
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,420
and two free pillows.

124
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,340
They make terrific pillows.

125
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,610
You'll get a 10-year
warranty on that mattress,

126
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,910
and you get to try it out
for 100 nights risk-free.

127
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,810
If you don't like it,

128
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,190
they'll come pick it up and take it away.

129
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,023
You won't get charged,

130
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,770
you'll get your money back, et cetera.

131
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,550
So that's helixsleep.com/huberman

132
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,320
for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

133
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,240
We are now beginning a new topic

134
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,410
for the next four to five episodes

135
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,630
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

136
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,120
Before we move into that,

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,370
I want to just briefly
touch on a couple questions

138
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,290
that I got from the last episode,

139
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,430
which was related to the
science of endurance training.

140
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,580
I described the four kinds
of endurance training.

141
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,660
We posted protocols of
the specific four kinds

142
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,370
of endurance training at hubermanlab.com.

143
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,410
Just go to that episode,
you can see the download,

144
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,280
it's a zero-cost PDF.

145
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,950
I got a lot of questions

146
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,070
about what's called concurrent training,

147
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,900
which is how to program endurance training

148
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,560
if you are also interested

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,610
in strength and hypertrophy training.

150
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,310
Or how to incorporate strength
and hypertrophy training,

151
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,810
which was in the previous
episode, with endurance training.

152
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,230
This can all be made very simple.

153
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,410
Ask yourself, what are
you trying to emphasize,

154
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,500
and then emphasize that
for a 10 to 12 week cycle.

155
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,400
So if you're mostly
interested in endurance,

156
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
I would say use a three to two ratio,

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,030
maybe get three endurance
training workouts per week,

158
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,470
maybe four, and two strength
and hypertrophy workouts.

159
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,320
If you're mainly focusing
on strength and hypertrophy,

160
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,240
get three or four workouts
for strength and hypertrophy

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,260
and do two endurance workouts.

162
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,400
Start with the minimum number
of sets that's required

163
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,790
to get the result that you want.

164
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,190
So if you're not accustomed
to doing endurance work,

165
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,670
you would start with the minimum number

166
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,230
that's listed on that protocol.

167
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,570
So if it says three to five sets,

168
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,120
you would start with
three, maybe even just two,

169
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,070
and then work your way up
by adding sets each week.

170
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,520
I do suggest that people get

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
at least one complete rest day per week.

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,190
And although I know a lot
of people don't like that,

173
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,023
I benefit from that.

174
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,100
I actually benefit from having

175
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,730
two complete rest days each week.

176
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,510
I just continue to make progress that way,

177
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,510
whether or not it's for
strength and hypertrophy

178
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,200
or for endurance.

179
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,780
I am a big believer in rest
days, other people are not.

180
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,970
And those could be active rest days,

181
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,493
hiking, relaxing, et cetera.

182
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,000
After a 10 to 12 week cycle,

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
then I also suggest taking anywhere

184
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,540
from five to seven days completely off.

185
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,200
You can still enjoy life and do things,

186
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,560
I know for you addicted exercisers

187
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,060
that you're going to loathe to do that,

188
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,700
but that's one way to stay injury free,

189
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
keep your joints and
tissues healthy over time,

190
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,300
and continue to make progress.

191
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
If you don't want to do
that week off, don't do it.

192
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,250
None of this is holy.

193
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,930
None of it is a strict prescriptive.

194
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,960
Just ask yourself, what
are you going to emphasize

195
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,050
and emphasize that, in
terms of the total volume

196
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,920
of workouts that you do,
and work up incrementally,

197
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,360
and then move into another cycle.

198
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,630
That's what I suggest.

199
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,990
So go to hubermanlab.com,

200
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,780
you can get the protocol there.

201
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,970
We are now going to move into a new topic

202
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,840
unrelated to physical performance.

203
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,550
Starting with this episode

204
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,500
and for the next four to five episodes,

205
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,283
we are going to talk all about the senses.

206
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,360
That's sight, eyesight,
hearing, touch, taste, smell,

207
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,560
and we're also going to talk
about this critical sense

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,170
that we call interoception,

209
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,040
or our sense of our internal real estate.

210
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,750
Now, the reason that we are
talking about the senses

211
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,720
is because if you understand
how the senses are perceived,

212
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,840
what they're about, what
the underlying cells

213
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,950
and connections are about,

214
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,980
you will be in a terrific position

215
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,220
to understand the month's
topic that follows,

216
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,590
which is all about mental health.

217
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,810
Now, I want to emphasize
that if you're somebody

218
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,730
who doesn't have any trouble

219
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,770
seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling

220
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,263
and has an excellent
sense of interoception,

221
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,910
I do believe that these episodes

222
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,990
will still be very relevant to you,

223
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,820
because they have everything to do with

224
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,470
how you move through the world,

225
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,830
how you make sense of information,

226
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,350
and how you organize your
thoughts and your emotions.

227
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,320
I also want to emphasize
that we're going to cover

228
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,059
a lot of practical tools.

229
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,649
So today's episode is going to be

230
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,900
all about vision and eyesight,

231
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,809
a topic that's very near
and dear to my heart,

232
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,010
because it's the one that
I've been focusing on

233
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,080
for well over 25 years of my career.

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,780
But we're not just going to get
into the mechanistic details

235
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,580
about how light is converted

236
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,070
into electrical potentials
and things like that.

237
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,950
We are going to talk about practical tools

238
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,490
that you can and should use
to help maintain the health

239
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,540
of your visual system and your eyesight.

240
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,740
Very often, young people
will say, what should I do?

241
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,260
You know, you're always talking about,

242
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,350
you know, neuroplasticity and
how it tapers off over time,

243
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,400
but I'm a young person, what should I do?

244
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,480
You should absolutely train
and support your eyesight.

245
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,520
In fact, if you're a young
person and you see perfectly,

246
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,140
or you feel as if you
see the world perfectly,

247
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,080
you are in the best position to bolster,

248
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,180
to reinforce that visual system,

249
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,000
so that you don't lose
your vision as you age.

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
In addition, you can
leverage your visual system

251
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,120
for better mental and
physical performance,

252
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,660
and we're going to talk about that.

253
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,860
If you're somebody who suffers

254
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,140
from a clinical disorder of vision,

255
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,260
you have trouble seeing,

256
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,650
or if you need corrective
lenses in order to see,

257
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,390
this episode is definitely for you.

258
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,701
And while of course I can't
make clinical diagnoses,

259
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,160
I can't have a one-to-one conversation

260
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,350
with any of you in this
format, nor am I a clinician,

261
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,270
I'm a scientist, not a physician.

262
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,780
I did consult with our
chair of ophthalmology,

263
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,840
Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg

264
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,130
at Stanford University School of Medicine,

265
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,630
as well as several other people

266
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,910
to really vet the information

267
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,390
and make sure that the protocols

268
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,930
that I'm describing are consistent

269
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,600
with the clinical literature.

270
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
If you have a severe eye problem,

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,460
you should be working with

272
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,030
a really good ophthalmologist
and/or optometrist,

273
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,420
but certainly an an ophthalmologist
who's a medical doctor.

274
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,330
But I do believe that the information

275
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,650
that we're going to discuss today

276
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,300
is going to be relevant to everybody

277
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,070
and will set the stage for the month

278
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,510
on mental health and mental performance.

279
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,120
So, let's get started.

280
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,790
When we hear the word vision,

281
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,090
we most often think about eyesight,

282
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,230
or our ability to perceive
shapes, and objects,

283
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,050
and faces, and colors.

284
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,150
And indeed, vision involves eyesight,

285
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,800
our ability to see shapes,
and objects, and faces,

286
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,480
and colors, and so forth.

287
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,480
However, our eyes are responsible
for much more than that,

288
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,320
including our mood,
our level of alertness,

289
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,330
and all of that is included
in what we call vision.

290
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,910
So I just want to take about
three, maybe four minutes,

291
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,790
and talk about how the visual
system works, how it's built,

292
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,560
and how you are able to
so-called see things around you.

293
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,670
I also want to describe the ways

294
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,140
in which your eyes and your visual system

295
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,930
impact your mood and
your level of alertness.

296
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,770
And then, we are going to get
right into some protocols,

297
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,800
some specific things that
each and all of you should do

298
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,670
if you want to enhance your vision

299
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,520
and maintain your vision as you get older.

300
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,400
And again, if you're a
15-year-old or a 12-year-old,

301
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,970
this episode is especially for you,

302
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,000
because your nervous system

303
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,250
is far more plastic than mine is.

304
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,950
It's much more amenable to change,

305
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,850
so you can really build a
very strong visual system.

306
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,390
And in doing that,

307
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,170
and if you adopt specific behaviors

308
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,690
at any age of light viewing

309
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,350
at particular times and particular ways,

310
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,470
then you can build an emotional system

311
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,960
that's also reinforced
by your visual system.

312
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,040
So, let's talk about vision.

313
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,873
What is vision?

314
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:10,193
Well, vision starts with the eyes.

315
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,400
We have no what's called
extraocular light perception.

316
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,900
While it feels good to
have light on our skin,

317
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,580
while it feels good to be outside

318
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,980
in the sunlight for most people,

319
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,750
the only way that light information

320
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,860
can get to the cells of your body

321
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,420
is through these two little goodies

322
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,253
on the front of your face.

323
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,220
And for those of you listening,

324
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm just pointing to my eyes.

325
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,420
As many of you have heard me say before,

326
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,860
on this and other podcasts,

327
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,180
your eyes, in particular,
your neural retinas

328
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,980
are part of your central nervous system.

329
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,310
They are part of your brain.

330
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,560
They're the only part of your brain

331
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,970
that sits outside the cranial vault.

332
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,260
In other words, you have
two pieces of your brain

333
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,120
that deliberately got squeezed

334
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
out of the skull during development

335
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
and placed in these things
we call eye sockets.

336
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,300
There's a genetic program
for the specific purpose

337
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,340
of making sure that three
little layers of neurons,

338
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,720
nerve cells, got squeezed out

339
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,250
and form what are called
your neural retinas.

340
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,190
Now, the eyes have a lot
of other goodies in them

341
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,350
that are very important,

342
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,183
and those are the goodies

343
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:11,370
that we're going to focus on a lot today.

344
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,660
There's a lens to focus light,
precisely to the retina.

345
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,483
If you're somebody who requires
eyeglasses or contacts,

346
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,350
chances are, you don't do that correctly,

347
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,520
and so, that's why you use other lenses,

348
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,600
like eyeglasses or contacts.

349
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
There are also other pieces of the eye

350
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,550
that are designed to
keep the eye lubricated.

351
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,840
You also have these things
that we call eyelashes.

352
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,090
Most people don't know this,

353
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,990
but eyelashes are there to
trigger the blink reflex

354
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,220
if a piece of dust or something
gets in front of your eye.

355
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,333
It's a beautiful adaptation of nature.

356
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,910
They aren't just aesthetically nice.

357
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,950
Costello happens to have
very long eyelashes.

358
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,320
He gets compliments
about this all the time.

359
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,770
Maybe you have long eyelashes.

360
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,600
I don't have particularly long eyelashes.

361
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
But the eyelashes are there,

362
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,250
so that if a piece of dust or something

363
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,880
starts to head towards the cornea,

364
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,690
the eye blinks very, very fast.

365
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,840
It's the fastest reflex you
own is your eye blink reflex.

366
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,160
We also have these things called eyelids.

367
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,700
Now, eyelids might seem like
the most boring topic of all,

368
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
but they are incredibly fascinating.

369
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,220
Today, we're going to talk
about how you can actually

370
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,410
use your visual system to
increase your levels of alertness

371
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,430
based on the neural circuits

372
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,690
that link your brainstem
with your eyelids.

373
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,840
And no, we are not going
to have a blinking contest,

374
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,020
because I would win and you would lose,

375
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,900
and that wouldn't be fun for you.

376
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,900
So, let's talk about what
the eyes do for vision.

377
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,300
Basically, the entire job of the eyes

378
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,670
is to collect light information

379
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,310
and send it off to the rest of the brain,

380
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,170
in a form that the brain can understand.

381
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,610
Remember, no light actually gets in

382
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,050
past those neural retinas.

383
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,090
It gets to the neural retina,

384
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,870
and we have specific cells in
the eye called photoreceptors.

385
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,130
They come in two different
types, rods and cones.

386
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,960
Cones are mainly responsible
for daytime vision,

387
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,590
and the rods are mainly
responsible for vision at night

388
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,223
or under low light conditions,
generally speaking.

389
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,270
So basically what happens
is if your eyelids are open,

390
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,270
light comes into the eye,
the lens focuses that light,

391
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,620
light is also just called
photons, light energy,

392
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,713
onto the retina.

393
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,820
These photoreceptors, the rods and cones,

394
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,670
have chemical reactions inside them

395
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,690
that involve things like vitamin A

396
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,890
and that chemical reaction

397
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,520
converts the light into electricity.

398
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,880
Now, that might seem incredibly abstract,

399
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,290
but the way to think about
this is very similar to,

400
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,650
for instance, you have
touch receptors on your skin

401
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,620
and when you press on
those touch receptors,

402
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,250
they convert pressure, physical pressure,

403
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,260
into electrical information

404
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,093
and those neurons send it up
to your spinal cord and brain,

405
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,170
and you can register that somebody or you

406
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,620
are touching the top of
your hand, as I'm doing now.

407
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,613
With the eyes and the retina,

408
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,320
it's just that light gets converted

409
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,490
into electrical information.

410
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,090
Within the eye, within the retina,

411
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,853
there are then a series
of stages of processing,

412
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,870
and that information eventually
gets sent into the brain

413
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,440
by a very specific class of neurons.

414
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,860
I would like you to know
the names of these neurons.

415
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,730
They're called retinal ganglion cells.

416
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,980
So the only thing you need to know

417
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,270
about the neuroscience
of the eye at this point

418
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,950
are that there are rods and cones.

419
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,930
The cones are involved
in bright daytime vision

420
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,993
and rods are involved in more
dusk or nighttime vision.

421
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,710
And you've got these cells
called retinal ganglion cells

422
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,750
that send the information
off to the rest of the brain.

423
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,550
Now, here's what's incredible.

424
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,040
I just want you to
ponder this for a second.

425
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,493
This still blows my mind.

426
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,923
Everything you see around you,

427
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,670
you're not actually seeing
those objects directly.

428
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,060
What you're doing is
you're making a best guess

429
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,950
about what's there based on
the pattern of electricity

430
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,940
that arrives in your brain.

431
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,910
Now, that might just seem totally wild

432
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,380
and hard to wrap your head around,

433
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,240
but think about it this way,

434
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,670
because this is the way it actually works.

435
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,480
Let's take an example of a
color, like green or blue.

436
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,470
You have cones in your eye

437
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,460
that respond best to
the wavelength of light

438
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,550
that is reflected off, say, a green apple.

439
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,230
So, you don't actually
see the green apple.

440
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,490
What you see is the light
bouncing off that green apple,

441
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,170
and it goes into your eye,

442
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,980
and you see it and perceive
it as round and green,

443
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,680
but not because you see anything green.

444
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,430
No green light arrives in your brain.

445
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,610
What happens is your
brain actually compares

446
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,620
the amount of green reflection
coming off that apple

447
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,910
to the amount of red and blue around it.

448
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,030
Well, you might say, well, the green apple

449
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,110
is sitting on a brown
table or a white surface.

450
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,080
Well, then, it will appear very green.

451
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,850
Because the amount of wavelength of light

452
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,500
for green is very high,

453
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,020
and the amount for red is very low,

454
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,760
and so, it looks very green, okay?

455
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,000
So, we don't actually
see anything directly.

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,330
What the brain is receiving
is a series of signals,

457
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,990
electrical signals, and it's
comparing electrical signals,

458
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,150
in order to come up with what
we call these perceptions.

459
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,890
Like I see something green,
a green apple, or I see red.

460
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,780
Let me give you a slightly
different example.

461
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,660
If you were to play a key on the piano,

462
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,540
let's say you play, I'm not a musician,

463
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,910
but I'm going to, so hopefully
I won't get this too incorrectly

464
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,300
but let's say you have like E sharp,

465
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,540
and maybe it's like ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

466
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,170
If the brain gets that signal,

467
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,970
it doesn't actually know E that's what,

468
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,660
it doesn't recognize it

469
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,570
until you were to play
another key next to it,

470
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,910
dun, dun, dun, dun,

471
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,470
and what it does, it does the math,

472
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,070
it does the subtraction,
and it compares those two.

473
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,740
So when we see something green,

474
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,280
or we see something red,
or we see something blue,

475
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,750
we're not actually seeing it directly.

476
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,500
The brain is making a guess about

477
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,900
how green or red or blue that thing is

478
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,070
by comparing what's around it, okay?

479
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,820
And if that seems hard
to wrap your head around,

480
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,460
don't worry, because we will explain it

481
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,690
in more depth going forward.

482
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,770
But I really want people
to understand this,

483
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,770
that vision, eyesight, is not
looking at things directly,

484
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,440
and that information getting
directly into your brain,

485
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
it is translated.

486
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,380
Light information is transformed
into electrical signals

487
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,840
that your visual system
exquisitely understands.

488
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,220
Now, what does this mean?

489
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,560
Why should you care about this?

490
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,290
Well, if you have a dog
like I do, or a cat,

491
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,090
they are not colorblind,

492
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,090
but they lack the cones
that respond to red,

493
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,190
meaning long wavelength light.

494
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,770
So what does that mean?

495
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,900
That means that when they see green,

496
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,933
it's different than the green you see.

497
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,470
Not because that apple
is invisible to them,

498
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,580
but because they aren't
able to compare it to red,

499
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,350
and you are.

500
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,220
As a consequence, when
they look at a green lawn,

501
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,170
it looks more brownish or orange to them.

502
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,640
When you wear a red shirt
in front of your dog or cat,

503
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,280
if you see a stop sign
and they see a stop sign,

504
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,610
they see orangish-brown, and you see red.

505
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,430
presuming that you are a trichromat,

506
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,730
meaning you have three-color vision.

507
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,030
So, this is all to say that every animal

508
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,700
sees the world differently,

509
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,390
depending on whether or not they have

510
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,560
one or two or three of
these different cones,

511
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,680
the red, blue, or green cones.

512
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,700
If you are a mantis shrimp of all things,

513
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,070
you see hundreds of colors

514
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,500
that human beings can't see, okay?

515
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,020
Many things animals see into visual ranges

516
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,610
that you and I can't see in.

517
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,090
So for instance, a pit
viper senses heat emissions,

518
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,210
it literally sees the
heat coming off of you

519
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,780
or of an animal that they want to eat.

520
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,780
If you are a ground squirrel,

521
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,810
you can see ultraviolet light.

522
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,870
This is going to sound kind of weird,

523
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,760
but ground squirrels
actually signal one another

524
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,790
by standing up outside
and shining sunlight

525
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,930
off each other's stomachs to each other,

526
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,790
signaling at a distance,
just like, you know,

527
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,310
you could signal somebody with a mirror

528
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,990
in sunlight at distance.

529
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,290
There are species of primates,

530
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,680
this isn't very pleasant to think about,

531
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,190
that urinate on their hands,

532
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,660
and then wipe it all over their stomach.

533
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,310
and then use that sunlight

534
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,290
to reflect different
signals to each other.

535
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,130
I don't know what they're saying.

536
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,720
We always assume it's
something cute and nice,

537
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,630
but maybe they're insulting each other.

538
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,630
So this actually gets right down

539
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,280
to the heart of these bigger questions,

540
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,110
like consciousness, what do we see?

541
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,950
What's out there?

542
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,220
How much of life is
really accessible to us?

543
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,590
And I could go on and on, you know,

544
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,200
this used to be kind
of an obsession of mine

545
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,270
when I was coming up in the
field of visual neuroscience

546
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,810
to understand how different
animals see the world

547
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,360
compared to us.

548
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,710
You know, I'll give one
more example, a diving bird,

549
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,840
you know, a bird that
flies over the ocean.

550
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,800
It has an incredible task.

551
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,950
It has to both view the horizon,

552
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,620
and it has to view schools of fish,

553
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,940
and then, it has to make a trajectory

554
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,560
down into the water and grab
one of those fish to eat.

555
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,890
And the water has what's
called a refractory index.

556
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,620
It actually shifts like a prism,

557
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,330
the impression or the perception

558
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,760
of where that fish is, right?

559
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,140
If the bird sees the fish
right below it, it has to know,

560
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,060
it has to adjust its diving
trajectory just right,

561
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,510
because it knows that that fish

562
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,540
actually isn't where it sees it.

563
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,300
It's probably a few inches
ahead or to the side of that,

564
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,200
because of the way that
water diverts the image.

565
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,620
If you've ever dropped a
coin to the bottom of a pool,

566
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,980
if you go straight down
looking at that location.

567
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,410
If you were to look from
the top of the pool,

568
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,170
and you dive straight down
with your eyes closed,

569
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,150
you will miss, because the water refracts,

570
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,370
it shifts the visual image.

571
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,430
Well, diving birds have an arrangement

572
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,610
of these retinal cells that
communicate to the brain

573
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,790
that's both a streak to view the horizon,

574
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,850
'cause they need to know where they are

575
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,890
relative to the horizon,

576
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,550
and they have a pupil like we
do on the bottom of their eye,

577
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,060
so that they can make very
accurate dive and attacks

578
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,160
on these schools of fish,

579
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,470
and catch fish, and eat those fish.

580
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,950
We just have pupils in
the middle of our eyes.

581
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,167
So there's a ton about
the optics of the eye,

582
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,530
and the way that it
communicates with the brain

583
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,080
that allows us to see.

584
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,540
We could spend hours talking about this,

585
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,970
but what I'd like to embed in your mind

586
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,320
is that what you experience
in the outside world

587
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,330
is bottlenecked, it's
limited by which wavelengths,

588
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,930
which colors if you will,
of light that you can see.

589
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,910
That your brain is coming up

590
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,850
with a best guess about what's there.

591
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,860
It doesn't actually know what's there.

592
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,110
And that your vision
is distinctly different

593
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,140
from say, the vision of a dog

594
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,190
or from the vision of
somebody who's a dichromat,

595
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,560
meaning they don't have a red cone.

596
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,920
A lot of people, in particular
about 1 in 80 males,

597
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,150
lacks a red cone and
therefore, sees the world

598
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,910
much the same way that Costello does.

599
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,910
Although, he sees it from just
much lower toward the ground.

600
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,180
So, that's what I'd like you to understand

601
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,010
about the way the eye
communicates with the brain.

602
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,280
I would also like you to understand

603
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,890
that the brain itself
is making these guesses

604
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,160
and that those guesses are largely right.

605
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,720
How do I know that?

606
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,260
Well, they're right
because when you reach out

607
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,390
to grab a glass, most of
the time you grab the glass,

608
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,370
and you don't miss, right?

609
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,250
Most of the time, when you make judgments

610
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,600
about the world around you,

611
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,620
based on your visual impression of them,

612
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,283
it allows you to move
functionally through the world.

613
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,670
But let me give you some examples

614
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,840
of where this guessing
is happening right now.

615
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,780
And it's so incredible that, to this day,

616
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,000
this still blows my mind.

617
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,320
Cover one eye with one hand.

618
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,570
If you're driving, maybe don't do this.

619
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,340
If you're viewing the world around you,

620
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,980
presumably you can see
everything that's out there.

621
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,160
I could do this with one
eye or the other eye.

622
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,810
You probably see better
out of one or the other,

623
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,110
and we'll talk about that.

624
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,870
You have a giant blind spot

625
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,370
in the middle of your visual field.

626
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,650
It's called your blind spot.

627
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,260
It is the spot in which
the connections, the wires,

628
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,900
from all those retinal ganglion cells

629
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,650
exit the back of the eye and
head off toward the brain.

630
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,010
In other words, you are
blind for a huge spot

631
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,060
of your central vision.

632
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,893
The part of your vision

633
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:13,080
that's highest acuity, highest detail,

634
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,610
and yet, you don't see that ever.

635
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,910
You cover one eye, and
you see perfectly fine.

636
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,150
And it's not just because your eye

637
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,680
is moving around really quickly.

638
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,940
Your brain is guessing
what's in that spot,

639
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,540
which is absolutely incredible,

640
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,160
and so, you don't see that blind spot.

641
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,330
This is happening all the time.

642
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,360
Now, when you have two eyes open,

643
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,180
the way that your eyes are
positioned in your head

644
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,490
and the way they view the world is such

645
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,680
that they fill in each
other's blind spots,

646
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,460
so it's pretty convenient.

647
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,540
But if you cover one
eye, that's impossible,

648
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,590
and yet, you still see
the world as complete.

649
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,400
So the brain is doing
these incredible things.

650
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,940
It's also creating
depth, a sense of depth.

651
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,430
Even though what arrives from the retina

652
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,550
is essentially a readout of a
two-dimensional, flat image,

653
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,810
so it can sense depth.

654
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,840
How do you know depth?

655
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,140
Well, this is very simple.

656
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,580
Things that are closer
to you tend to be larger

657
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,320
than things that are far away.

658
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,450
Things that are closer to you

659
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,500
tend to look like they're moving faster.

660
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,700
If you've ever been in a train
and you look to your side,

661
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,140
the rungs on a fence, or the
train tracks going by you,

662
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,310
look like they're going very fast.

663
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,190
If you look off in the distance,

664
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,230
they look like they're moving very slowly.

665
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,200
And there are differences

666
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
between what's close to you
and what's further away.

667
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,920
So, a little house on the horizon,

668
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,830
you don't look at it and say,

669
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,740
oh, that must be a tiny, little house.

670
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,270
You have some prior knowledge

671
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,700
that things further away are smaller.

672
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,150
So that's the main way that you do that.

673
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,630
And you compare the location,

674
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,440
at which information about
light lands on the two eyes.

675
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,550
So your eyes are slightly
offset from one another.

676
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,200
So that, for instance, if I look at you,

677
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,527
if you were standing right
in front of me right now,

678
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,040
and I were to look at you,

679
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,680
the image of your face,

680
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,480
the light bouncing off your
face to be more precise,

681
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,600
lands on one eye in a
slightly different location

682
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,910
than it does in the other eye,
and then the brain does math.

683
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,480
It basically does the equivalent

684
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,400
of geometry and trigonometry,

685
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,270
and essentially figures out
how far away you are from me,

686
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,540
which is just incredible.

687
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,080
So the brain does all
this very, very fast,

688
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,210
and the brain uses about 40 to 50%

689
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,350
of its total real estate for vision.

690
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,980
That's how important vision is.

691
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,740
Now, for those of you that are blind,

692
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,330
or low vision, or no vision,
that real estate in the brain

693
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,200
will be taken over by neurons
that control sense of touch

694
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,160
and a sense of hearing,

695
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,840
and your, indeed, hearing
and touch are much better,

696
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,400
higher acuity, and faster in blind people.

697
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,450
But for most of you, who
I presume are sighted,

698
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,180
this is how it works.

699
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,290
So, that's kind of vision from
eye to brain in a nutshell.

700
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,410
There are a bunch of different stations

701
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,760
in the brain that do different things.

702
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,510
That's eyesight.

703
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,510
Now, I want to talk about
the other aspect of vision,

704
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,780
which is the stuff that
you don't perceive,

705
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,750
the subconscious stuff.

706
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,780
And then, we'll transition directly

707
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,440
into how you can use light and eyesight

708
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,537
to control this other stuff
because it's very important

709
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:13,537
and that other stuff is
mood, sleep, and appetite.

710
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,320
And there are ways in which
you can use the same protocols

711
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,800
that I will describe,

712
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,560
in order to preserve and
even enhance your vision,

713
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,470
your ability to see things
and consciously perceive them.

714
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,050
So the protocols we will describe

715
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,300
have a lot of carry over
to both conscious eyesight

716
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,460
and to these subconscious
aspects of vision.

717
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,390
And I just want you to
understand a little bit more

718
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,460
about the science of seeing,
of eyesight and vision,

719
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,570
and then all the protocols
will make perfect sense.

720
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,740
So as amazing as eyesight is,

721
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,710
it actually did not evolve for us

722
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,930
to see shapes and colors
and motion and form.

723
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,070
The most ancient cells in our eyes,

724
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,700
and the reason we have eyes,
is to communicate information

725
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,790
about time of day to the
rest of the brain and body.

726
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,070
Remember, there's no
extraocular photo reception.

727
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,870
There's no way for light information

728
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,420
to get to all the cells of your body,

729
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,430
but every cell in your body needs to know

730
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,737
if it's night or day.

731
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:15,360
And I talked a little bit about this

732
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,970
on the, in the episodes on sleep,

733
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,630
and this episode is not about sleep.

734
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,490
But I want to emphasize that
there is a particular category

735
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,700
of retinal ganglion cell,

736
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,913
remember the neurons that
connect the retina to the brain,

737
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,020
that is involved in a
special kind of vision

738
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,040
that has nothing to do
with conscious perception

739
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,270
of what's around you,

740
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,600
and it's happening right now,
it's happening all the time.

741
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,160
These are so-called melanopsin
retinal ganglion cells,

742
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,250
named after the opsin that
they contain within them.

743
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,150
They are essentially photoreceptors,

744
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,810
remember before I said
there are photoreceptors

745
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,770
and then these ganglion cells?

746
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,050
Well, these melanopsin
cells, as the name suggests,

747
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,093
melanopsin, have their own
photoreceptor built inside them.

748
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,480
The opsin that they contain

749
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,070
is actually very similar to the melanopsin

750
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,980
that is present in the
skin of some amphibians

751
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,450
and that causes those amphibians
to change their skin color

752
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,770
in different light conditions.

753
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,860
So you have, believe it or not,

754
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,860
a little bit of frog skin
in your eye, so to speak.

755
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,700
Okay, not exactly, but you
essentially have the equivalent

756
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,793
of what frogs have on
their skin in your eye.

757
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,023
If you are low vision or no vision,

758
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,830
as long as you have retinas,

759
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,070
it's very likely you
still have these cells,

760
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,420
even though you can't see
or you don't see well.

761
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,490
These cells, retinal ganglion cells,

762
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,190
communicate to areas of the brain

763
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,680
when particular qualities of light

764
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,990
are present in your environment
and signal to the brain,

765
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,523
therefore, that it's early
day or late in the day.

766
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,130
These melanopsin ganglion cells

767
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,880
are sometimes also called
intrinsically photosensitive cells

768
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,540
because they behave like photoreceptors.

769
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,130
What do these cells respond to,

770
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,510
and why should you care about them?

771
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,750
Well, you should care about them,

772
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,730
because they regulate
when you'll get sleepy,

773
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,640
when you'll feel awake, how
fast your metabolism is,

774
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,490
excuse me, your blood sugar levels,

775
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,513
your dopamine levels,
and your pain threshold.

776
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,330
There are other factors
that impact those things,

777
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,070
but they are one of the,

778
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,450
if not the most powerful determinant,

779
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,190
of those other things like
mood and pain threshold,

780
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,483
sleepiness, wakefulness, et cetera.

781
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,870
These melanopsin ganglion cells

782
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,870
have been shown by the
Nitz Group, N-I-T-Z,

783
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,380
up at University of Washington,

784
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,780
and by Samer Hattar's lab
and David Burson's lab,

785
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,420
and a number of other people's labs,

786
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,410
Satchin Panda, Prevencio, et cetera,

787
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,660
a number of excellent labs in neuroscience

788
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,060
to set the circadian clock

789
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,630
and to respond best to the contrast

790
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,850
between blue and yellow light

791
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,850
of the sort that lands on the
cells when you view the sun,

792
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,090
when it's a so-called low solar angle,

793
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,330
when it's low in the sky,

794
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,210
either in the morning or in the evening,

795
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,380
what does all this mean?

796
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,550
It means, and here's the first protocol,

797
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,940
and you've probably
heard me say this before,

798
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,490
but is appropriate to this
episode to say it again.

799
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,330
If you are not viewing the sun, sunlight,

800
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,030
even through cloud cover,

801
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,400
for two to 10 minutes in
the early part of the day,

802
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,640
when the sun is still low in the sky

803
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,240
and doing the same thing
again in the evening,

804
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,870
you are severely disrupting
your sleep rhythms,

805
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,180
your mood, your hormones, your metabolism,

806
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,630
your pain threshold,
and many other factors,

807
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,800
including your ability to
learn and remember information.

808
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,510
The most central and important
aspect of our biology,

809
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,470
and perhaps our psychology as well,

810
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,470
is to anchor ourselves in
time, to know when we exist.

811
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,750
Okay, it sounds a little bit
abstract and philosophical,

812
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,583
but it's not.

813
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:15,550
And we don't know time as a real thing

814
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,770
because of watches and clocks.

815
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,400
We know time at a biological level,

816
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,350
based on where the sun is and where,

817
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,270
which of course is where
we are relative to the sun,

818
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,840
because the earth is spinning around.

819
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,330
Now, what does this mean for a protocol?

820
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,660
It means, see, get that light
in your eyes early in the day,

821
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,190
and anytime you want to be awake.

822
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,470
So try and get as much sunlight

823
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,200
in your eyes during the
day as you safely can.

824
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,300
We'll talk about eye safety
this episode in depth.

825
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,850
And the blue light and the
contrast of that blue yellow,

826
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,950
remember we don't see blue,
this is all subconscious.

827
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,130
This is blue reflections
coming off of sunlight.

828
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,170
Blue light, we've been
told is so terrible for us,

829
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,840
it is absolutely essential and wonderful

830
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,330
for waking up the brain,

831
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,340
for triggering all sorts of
positive biological reactions,

832
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,650
but it needs to be
viewed early in the day.

833
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,840
If you can't see sunlight,

834
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,400
because it's the thick
cloud cover of say a,

835
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,429
you know, you're in
the UK and it's winter,

836
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,639
then artificial lights,
especially blue lights,

837
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,697
would be very beneficial to you.

838
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:16,939
We need a lot of this light
and its contrast with yellow,

839
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,199
in order to trigger
these melanopsin cells,

840
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,599
which will then trigger
your circadian clock,

841
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,739
which sits above the roof of your mouth,

842
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,809
which will signal every cell in your body,

843
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,100
including temperature, rhythms, et cetera.

844
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,560
So first things first, your visual system

845
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,960
was not for seeing
faces, motion, et cetera.

846
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,113
The most ancient cells in your eye,

847
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,960
which are there right now as we speak,

848
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,960
are there to inform your body
and brain about time of day,

849
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,560
so you want to get that
bright light early in the day.

850
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,139
Absolutely essential, two to 10 minutes,

851
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,129
you can download the light meter app

852
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,710
if you want to measure lux.

853
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,270
When we, when I explained how
to do that in earlier episodes

854
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,080
it got a little convoluted,

855
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,100
get that two to 10 minutes,
ideally without sunglasses.

856
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,490
Now, here's another reason to do this,

857
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,720
and I've never spoken about
this before on any podcast,

858
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,510
which is that there have
been several studies now

859
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,150
in thousands of subjects,

860
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,010
exploring what can be done

861
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,410
to prevent myopia, nearsightedness,

862
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,123
and other visual defects.

863
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,520
And it turns out, in a series
of large clinical trials,

864
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,040
the conclusion has emerged
that getting two hours a day

865
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,700
of outdoor time without sunglasses,

866
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,940
blue light, this blue light
that everyone has demonized,

867
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,380
getting that sunlight during
the day for two hours,

868
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,010
even if you're reading other things,

869
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,970
and doing other things outside,

870
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,610
has a significant effect
on reducing the probability

871
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,493
that you will get myopia, nearsightedness.

872
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,190
Now, whether or not that's also due

873
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,020
to the fact that myopia can be caused

874
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,640
by viewing things up close to too much.

875
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,540
So if you're indoors,

876
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,340
we tend to be looking at
things more closely, right?

877
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,750
Unless you have a very large house

878
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,900
with walls that are
very far away from you,

879
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,810
but the effect does seem
to be directly related

880
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,170
to getting sunlight,

881
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,760
and not just to the distance
that you're viewing.

882
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,730
I'm going to describe
this study just briefly,

883
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,020
but this is a second protocol.

884
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,700
So we have one protocol
about getting sunlight

885
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,710
to set your circadian
clocks, meaning wake you up,

886
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,560
establish your sleep, will occur
about 12 to 16 hours later,

887
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,700
that's all in the sleep episode.

888
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,840
But also to enhance your mood,
to enhance your metabolism,

889
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,950
to optimize your hormone levels,

890
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,990
and to optimize learning
and dopamine levels,

891
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,700
this feel good neuromodulator

892
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,823
that's essential to not
getting depressed, et cetera.

893
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,330
But now's the second protocol,

894
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,900
which is ideally, and
this includes children,

895
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,590
as long as they're not very small infants,

896
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,930
ideally, we're all getting
two hours of outdoor time,

897
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,690
even if there's cloud cover.

898
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,020
Remember, we evolved mostly
under outdoor conditions,

899
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,320
not indoor conditions,

900
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,260
and no artificial blue light

901
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,620
will not replace this
aspect of your visual system

902
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,510
and offsetting myopia.

903
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,280
So I just want to briefly
describe this study,

904
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,470
because it's a very important one,

905
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,070
and I don't think it's
discussed often enough.

906
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,560
There are many studies exploring this,

907
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,100
but one of the ones I liked the most,

908
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,750
looked at 693 students,

909
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,850
and a subset of them were encouraged

910
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,830
to spend 11 hours a week outdoors.

911
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,530
Okay, so most kids are in
school five days a week or so,

912
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,100
so they're spending 11
hours a week outdoors.

913
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,500
They are sometimes reading outdoors.

914
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,850
They're not always just playing outdoors,

915
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,063
they might be reading books, et cetera.

916
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,350
They used eight different schools.

917
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,650
And the reason they did the study,

918
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,570
I probably should have mentioned,

919
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,560
is that myopia, nearsightedness,
is a global epidemic.

920
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,850
At least, that's how it was
referred to in the study.

921
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,060
I don't know who decides
what's an epidemic or not.

922
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,960
I think there are thresholds for that.

923
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,970
This paper published in the
journal Ophthalmology in 2018

924
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,700
described the fact that being
outdoors for two hours a day

925
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,380
could significantly reduce the probability

926
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,600
that these children would
develop nearsightedness.

927
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,040
And it turns out based on other studies,

928
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,530
that adults who spend
two hours a day outside,

929
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,420
that would be reading
outside, talking outside.

930
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,960
No, it does not include light

931
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,680
coming through the windshield of your car,

932
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,380
I'll explain why in a few moments,

933
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,570
offset the formation of myopia.

934
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,210
Now, myopia, or nearsightedness,

935
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,480
has to do with the way that the lens

936
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,350
focuses light onto the retina.

937
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,570
I don't want to get into a
long description of this now,

938
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,130
but basically the lens has
bring light to the retina,

939
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,530
not in front of it, not behind it.

940
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,270
If it brings light to a
position in front of the retina,

941
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,050
then you won't see clearly, you
will need corrective lenses.

942
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,920
If it brings light directly to the retina,

943
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,230
then you will see clearly,

944
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,230
that should be intuitive why
that makes, why it makes sense.

945
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,340
So you might say, well,
why would being outside,

946
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,440
getting this blue light

947
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,270
or this blue-yellow contrast from sunlight

948
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,600
actually offset myopia?

949
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,740
Well, it probably, and I
want to emphasize probably

950
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,720
has to do with the fact

951
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
that these melanopsin ganglion cells,

952
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,150
these intrinsically
photosensitive ganglion cells,

953
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,120
are not just responsible for sleep,

954
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,750
and talking to your circadian
clock, and that sort of thing,

955
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,380
they also make connections
within the retina.

956
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,150
They connect to things like,

957
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,440
this is for the aficionados,

958
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,150
the ciliary body, the iris,

959
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,790
the muscles and the
structures within the eye

960
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,040
that actually move the lens

961
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,950
and allow you to adjust your vision

962
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,240
to things up close or far away.

963
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,020
And in doing so, they
increase or improve the health

964
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,860
of the little tiny muscles within the eye

965
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,880
that move the lens.

966
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,660
And they probably, again, this
needs a little bit more work,

967
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,760
in order to really tamp
down the mechanism.

968
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000
They're probably also involved

969
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,140
in bringing growth
factors and blood supply

970
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,990
to the muscles and to the
neurons that are responsible

971
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,810
for this focusing
mechanism within the eye.

972
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,640
So remember, your eye
is an optical device.

973
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,820
You were born with lenses,
you don't have to use glasses,

974
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,340
or maybe you do because you
have lenses in your eyes

975
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,840
and those lenses need to move.

976
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,233
It's not a rigid lens, like a glass lens.

977
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:15,417
It's a dynamic lens,

978
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:17,760
and it has little muscles that pull on it,

979
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,440
and squeeze it, and make
it thicker or thinner,

980
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,290
as you look at things close and far away,

981
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,270
and I'll describe how
that works in a moment.

982
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:30,170
These melanopsin cells and
their activation by sunlight,

983
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,543
completely subconsciously,
unaware, you're unaware of this,

984
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,210
promote the health of
this system within the eye

985
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:43,030
and allow you to offset the
myopia, nearsightedness.

986
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,240
In other words, getting
outside for two hours a day,

987
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,590
each day, on average, even
if there's cloud cover,

988
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,600
without sunglasses on,

989
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,600
will allow you to offset
the formation of myopia.

990
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,520
Now, you might still form myopia

991
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,220
if you have certain structural features

992
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,370
or a genetic basis for that,

993
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,590
we will talk about things
that you can do as well.

994
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,840
But for everybody, we
should be doing this.

995
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,270
And that might seem like a lot,

996
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,670
but this is the way that
your visual system works.

997
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,130
Staying indoors, just
getting artificial light,

998
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,520
and looking at things up
close leads to visual defects.

999
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,870
Okay, it's a form of kind of
like visual obesity, right?

1000
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,620
The posture of your visual
system, if you will,

1001
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,120
is going to be unhealthy
if you're just indoors

1002
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,270
and you're not getting
sunlight early in the day

1003
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,790
and for at least two hours per day.

1004
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,870
I want to talk a little bit
more about how our eyes adjust

1005
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,223
to things that are
close to us or far away.

1006
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,260
This is an absolutely
brilliant consequence

1007
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,690
of our nature and our design.

1008
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,670
And whenever I say nature and design,

1009
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,290
people always ask me, you know,

1010
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,470
what are you really trying to say?

1011
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,950
Are you trying to talk about creators?

1012
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,440
Are you talking about intelligent design?

1013
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,710
Look, I want to be very frank with you.

1014
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,890
I wasn't consulted at the design phase,

1015
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,000
and neither were you.

1016
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,160
And so, that is all very interesting,

1017
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,260
but it's not the topic of this discussion.

1018
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,630
What is clear and what is
the topic of this discussion

1019
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,070
is that the eye can dynamically adjust

1020
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,760
where light lands by moving the lens

1021
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,110
and changing the shape
of the lens in your eye,

1022
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,770
through a process called accommodation.

1023
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,810
And if you understand this
process of accommodation,

1024
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,920
you not only can enhance
the health of your eyes

1025
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,810
in the immediate and long-term,

1026
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,830
but you also can work better.

1027
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,930
You'll be able to focus better
on physical and mental work.

1028
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,840
You will be able to
concentrate for longer.

1029
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,030
And I want to emphasize that
so much of our mental focus,

1030
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,840
whether or not it's
for cognitive endeavors

1031
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,193
or physical endeavors,

1032
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,210
is grounded in where we
place our visual focus, okay?

1033
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,010
What we look at and our ability

1034
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,930
to hold our concentration there

1035
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,810
is critically determining how we think.

1036
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,950
So, in other words, if
you can hold visual focus,

1037
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,550
you can hold mental
focus, cognitive focus,

1038
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:02,880
but holding visual focus is
challenging, it's tiring,

1039
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,280
because it requires movement of the lens.

1040
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,380
And that movement of the lens

1041
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,210
requires activation of muscles.

1042
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,420
And the activation of muscles,

1043
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,960
as you know from the physical
performance episodes,

1044
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,490
if you saw them and even if you don't,

1045
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,560
is dictated by neurons.

1046
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,200
So, what is accommodation?

1047
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,190
Well, it's actually very
simple and very elegant.

1048
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,070
And again, this is another case where

1049
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,560
whenever I look at this stuff,

1050
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,200
even though I've been
looking at for years,

1051
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,710
learning about it for years,
it still boggles my mind

1052
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,740
that we have these apparati
built into our eyes.

1053
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,430
So, we have lenses in our eyes,

1054
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,330
and we have these things
called the irises.

1055
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,020
You know, you're all
familiar with the iris,

1056
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,120
because you'll see people's
pupils get bigger or smaller,

1057
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,990
and we intuitively think of
eyes as having the pupils.

1058
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,110
If you actually draw two
circles on a sheet of paper,

1059
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,960
and you just, they look like two circles.

1060
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,800
But if you put little dots
in the middle of them,

1061
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,990
they look like eyes.

1062
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:58,810
Your brain recognizes those as eyes,

1063
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,120
because one of the first things you see

1064
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,990
when you come into this world are eyes.

1065
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,570
And actually, if you put the
little dots close together,

1066
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,810
it'll look kind of wrong,
like it's cross-eyed.

1067
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,200
And if you put them at different locations

1068
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,080
within those two dots,
of opposing locations,

1069
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,140
it'll look google-eyed.

1070
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,650
And so, your brain is actually filling in

1071
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,070
all the face and other information,

1072
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,850
even emotional information,

1073
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,390
just based on this recognition of eyes.

1074
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,660
And so, there's clearly we know this,

1075
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,517
there's real estate deep up in,

1076
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:24,750
you know, further up in the brain,

1077
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:29,380
that's responsible for
analyzing and recognizing faces

1078
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,750
and the eyes and the position

1079
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,520
of these little things we call irises,

1080
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,310
and pupils, et cetera, is really important

1081
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,520
for how we interpret the status of others.

1082
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,020
And that's why it's such a powerful thing

1083
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,730
just to put two circles and, you know,

1084
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,720
move the pupils around on paper.

1085
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,577
In fact, I want to get into accommodation,

1086
00:44:47,577 --> 00:44:49,260
but if you think about it,

1087
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,707
if one of my pupils was up there

1088
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:51,970
and the other one was down there,

1089
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,650
one was really big, and
one was really small,

1090
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,970
that would actually be a
sign of pretty severe damage.

1091
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,090
If someone gets hit hard
on the side of the head,

1092
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,870
you'll notice that they
shine a light in one eye.

1093
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,780
You know why they're doing that?

1094
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,390
They're actually looking at the other eye.

1095
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,820
When you shine light of the
eye that pupil constricts

1096
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,240
to limit the amount of
light that comes in,

1097
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,393
so it doesn't damage the eye.

1098
00:45:09,393 --> 00:45:11,820
This also happens when you
walk outside, and it's bright,

1099
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,280
it constricts, but we have what's called

1100
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,150
the consensual pupil reflex.

1101
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,110
There's a connection
deep in the brainstem,

1102
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,510
deep back here in the brain near my neck,

1103
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,040
that connects the pupil
mechanism for the two eyes,

1104
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,090
and they're looking at the other eye.

1105
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,920
And if you shine light in one eye,

1106
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,160
and that people constricts
but the other one doesn't,

1107
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,610
there's a good chance
there's brainstem damage.

1108
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,790
This is what they do on the side

1109
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,130
of a, you know, football
field or a boxing match,

1110
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,800
or if someone unfortunately
hits their head.

1111
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,160
So, two pupils and don't
freak out if one pupil

1112
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,480
is a little bit smaller than the other,

1113
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,020
that doesn't necessarily
mean brain damage.

1114
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,910
But if you suddenly have one
pupil bigger than the other,

1115
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,860
you absolutely want to go
see a neurologist right away.

1116
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,640
So, the eyes and the pupils
are indicative of things

1117
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,830
that are happening deep in the brain.

1118
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,570
Now, accommodation is our
ability to accommodate

1119
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:02,100
to things that are up
close here or further away.

1120
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,560
And the way this works is that the iris,

1121
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,550
and the musculature, and a structure

1122
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,660
called the ciliary body move the lens.

1123
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,780
So, when you look far away,

1124
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,320
okay, when you see things far away,

1125
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,950
your lens actually relaxes,
it can flatten out.

1126
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:18,783
So I want you to think about this.

1127
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:20,410
When you look far away,

1128
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,750
when it may be anywhere from
like 20 feet away from you

1129
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,990
out to a horizon that's miles
or kilometers away from you,

1130
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,500
the lens can just relax.

1131
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,000
It can flatten out.

1132
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,310
And you'll notice that
it actually is relaxing

1133
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,100
to look at a horizon.

1134
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,860
It's relaxing to look far away.

1135
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,970
Whereas if I look at
something up close to me

1136
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,710
like this pen, or my phone,
or a computer screen,

1137
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,870
or this microphone, it takes effort.

1138
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:46,470
You'll sense the effort.

1139
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,710
Now, some of that effort
is actually eye movements,

1140
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,380
because you have muscles
that can move your eyes

1141
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,190
within their sockets.

1142
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,480
But a lot of the work, quote unquote,

1143
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,320
is neural work of the muscles
having to move and contract,

1144
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,430
such that the lens actually gets thicker,

1145
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,540
in order to bring the light to the retina

1146
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,260
and not to a location in
front of it or behind it,

1147
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,280
so called accommodation.

1148
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,330
There's also changes in
the size of the pupil,

1149
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,800
as things are closer and
further away from you.

1150
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,360
In fact, there's a simple
way to think about this.

1151
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,960
Healthy pupils are going to dilate

1152
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,560
when you look at something
far away from you.

1153
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,630
Now, when you see
something that excites you

1154
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,240
or stresses you out,
your pupils also get big.

1155
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,323
Your eyes get wide.

1156
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,500
But if you look at something far away,

1157
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,730
your pupils are going to dilate.

1158
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,180
And when you look at things
that are closer to you,

1159
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,120
when you move them up close,

1160
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,660
the pupils are going to shrink.

1161
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,550
That's all part of this
accommodation mechanism.

1162
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:44,990
Now, you might say,

1163
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,600
why are you telling me
about accommodation?

1164
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,433
This is crazy.

1165
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:48,280
Why are you telling me about this?

1166
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,740
Well, these days we're
spending a lot of time

1167
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,010
looking at things, mainly
our phones up close,

1168
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,770
and computers up close,
and we are indoors.

1169
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,830
If you are a young person, and
even if you are 25 or older,

1170
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,530
and you are spending a lot of time

1171
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,320
looking at things up close,

1172
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:08,220
and you are not allowing
your vision to relax.

1173
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,470
In other words, you are
not giving your lens

1174
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,840
the opportunity to flatten out,

1175
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,083
and for these muscles to
relieve themselves of this work,

1176
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,780
you may or may not have
migraine headaches.

1177
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,810
You may or may not have headaches.

1178
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,650
You might, and that could
be the cause of those.

1179
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,120
But you are also training your eyes

1180
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,910
to be good at looking at things
up close and not far away,

1181
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,970
and as a consequence,

1182
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,240
you are reshaping the neural
circuitry in your brain,

1183
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,870
and it is not good.

1184
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:43,660
It is not healthy to only
look at things up close.

1185
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,820
Now, there are a lot of
recommendations out there right now,

1186
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,470
especially with all the lockdowns

1187
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,610
of the last, you know, 12 to 18 months

1188
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,620
that people should look up from
Zoom every once in a while.

1189
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,750
Or maybe now, I'm hearing
that people should take calls

1190
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,060
instead of doing Zoom,

1191
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,630
where you should look up
from your computer screen.

1192
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:59,720
It's actually not going
to solve the problem,

1193
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,640
just to look up from your computer screen.

1194
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,890
You need to go to a window.

1195
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,450
You need to look out at a distance.

1196
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:08,150
Ideally, you would even open the window,

1197
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,520
because those windows actually filter out

1198
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,420
a lot of the blue light that
you want during the daytime.

1199
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,550
A lot of the sunlight,

1200
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,150
it's actually 50 times less gets through.

1201
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,490
You want to get out onto a balcony.

1202
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,570
You want to relax your eyes
and look out at the horizon.

1203
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,480
You want to go into what's
called panoramic vision,

1204
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,030
and let your vision expand.

1205
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,310
You want this lens mechanism
to be very elastic.

1206
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,080
You don't want it to get stuck

1207
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,330
in that configuration of
looking at things up close.

1208
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,300
Accommodation is a wonderful
feature of your visual system,

1209
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,200
but you don't want to push that too hard,

1210
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,673
too often, or for too long.

1211
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,050
You want to view the horizon.

1212
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,360
You want to get outside,

1213
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,770
not just to lighten the load on your mind,

1214
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,020
or to think about other things,

1215
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,300
but to maintain the health
of your visual system.

1216
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,780
In other words, you want
to exercise these muscles

1217
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,170
and that involves both the lens moving

1218
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:05,670
and getting kind of thicker
and relaxing that lens.

1219
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,960
And the relaxation of the lens

1220
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,590
is actually one of the
best things you can do

1221
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,970
for the musculature of the inner eye.

1222
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,960
So what's the protocol, how
often should you do this?

1223
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,840
You might be surprised,

1224
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,090
but for every 30 minutes of focused work,

1225
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,230
you probably want to look
up every once in a while

1226
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,240
and just try and relax
your face and eye muscles,

1227
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,470
including your jaw muscles,

1228
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,780
because all these things are
closely linked in the brainstem

1229
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,610
and allow your eyes to go into
a so-called panoramic vision,

1230
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,360
where you're just not
really focusing on anything

1231
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,840
and then refocus on your work.

1232
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,840
At least every 90 minutes of
looking at things up close,

1233
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,790
or even if you're looking at a screen,

1234
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,890
you know, television screen,

1235
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,090
or you're watching a
movie, or you're indoors,

1236
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:49,180
for every 90 minutes of that,

1237
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,510
you ideally would have at least 20,

1238
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,410
probably more like 30 minutes
of being outside, ideally.

1239
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:02,107
But if you can't be outside,
of non up-close vision.

1240
00:51:02,107 --> 00:51:03,260
And you might say, that's impossible,

1241
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,340
how am I supposed to do that?

1242
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,980
You know, I'm in an office
or I'm in a building.

1243
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,550
Get to a window, get outside
if you can do it safely,

1244
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,940
get onto a balcony, and
just let your eyes relax.

1245
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,143
Many people are experiencing
severe vision problems,

1246
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,190
because they're not getting
enough sunlight during the day.

1247
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,410
They have sleep problems,

1248
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,670
because they're not viewing
sunlight early in the day.

1249
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,870
And as I've mentioned
in previous episodes,

1250
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,170
they're getting a lot of
artificial stimulation,

1251
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,380
artificial light stimulation,

1252
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,780
of the eye in the middle of the night,

1253
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,920
all of this is through the visual system.

1254
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,963
So migraines, fatigue,

1255
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,320
challenges with your eyesight
getting worse as you age,

1256
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,620
or even in young people, there's a,

1257
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,550
you know, at least
according to the articles,

1258
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,520
they describe it as
this epidemic of myopia

1259
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,480
can largely be dealt
with by getting outside,

1260
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,320
going into panoramic vision,

1261
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,850
experiencing some distanced vision,

1262
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,040
look at things off in the horizon.

1263
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,980
If you're walking or hiking or biking,

1264
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,530
not looking at your phone the whole time

1265
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,620
that you're doing that.

1266
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,270
If you're at the bus
stop or you're commuting,

1267
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,970
certainly not looking at your phone

1268
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,240
the entire time you're doing that.

1269
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,530
So this is vital.

1270
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,800
And I want to emphasize another protocol,

1271
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,340
though I don't want to get
into it in too much depth,

1272
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,173
'cause I want to make sure

1273
00:52:16,173 --> 00:52:18,810
that I also talk about a number
of other important aspects

1274
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,370
of the visual system that
are more related to sight,

1275
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:25,960
but getting into optic
flow is very important

1276
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,253
for de-stressing your system.

1277
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,760
When you move through space,

1278
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,610
whether or not it's through
walking, biking, even swimming,

1279
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,520
if it's self-generated optic flow,

1280
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,110
so probably not driving or motorcycling,

1281
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:43,840
but yes, bicycling or I
don't know, unicycling.

1282
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,980
I don't know why I
thought about unicycling.

1283
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,320
There used to be a graduate
student at Stanford

1284
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,670
who was a really impressive unicycler,

1285
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,770
those are pretty rare.

1286
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,960
As long as it's self-generated optic flow,

1287
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,550
meaning you're generating
motion of your body

1288
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,570
and the visual images around you

1289
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,840
are passing by on your eyes,

1290
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,940
that is very good for the visual system.

1291
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,010
And it's very good for the mood systems

1292
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,100
and the neuromodulator
systems of the brain and body

1293
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,310
that regulate mood.

1294
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,240
This is well-established.

1295
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,320
So I'm not telling people to get away

1296
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,440
from their phone and their computers.

1297
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,670
I spend a lot of time staring at a page,

1298
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,570
drawing, writing, texting,
et cetera, just like you do,

1299
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:20,080
but we're really talking about
some very simple protocols

1300
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,240
that aren't just designed
to improve your sleep,

1301
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,335
but are really designed to
bolster and enhance your vision.

1302
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:28,010
And of course, because it's this podcast,

1303
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,270
we will also talk about things

1304
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,050
that you can take to improve your vision.

1305
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,140
But if your visual behavior isn't right,

1306
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,360
and I do believe we should
always start with behaviors,

1307
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,930
and then think about nutrition,
supplementation, et cetera,

1308
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,140
if your behaviors around
vision aren't right,

1309
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,270
you cannot expect to have
good, healthy eyesight

1310
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,600
for a long time, meaning
throughout your lifespan.

1311
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,410
And if your vision is already poor,

1312
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,860
many of these things that
I'm talking about today,

1313
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,693
perhaps all of them,

1314
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:56,510
will improve your vision to some degree.

1315
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,070
And if your vision is starting to go,

1316
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,910
then doing these behaviors

1317
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,940
is likely to really enhance
the quality of the vision

1318
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,660
that you will build
and maintain over time.

1319
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,820
And all of these are
essentially zero cost, okay?

1320
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,770
If you live in a very dark environment,

1321
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,770
like a cave or outer space,

1322
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,560
it's going to be hard to
do some of this stuff.

1323
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,610
But if you're on planet earth,
even if there's cloud cover,

1324
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,000
chances are you can do some, or most,

1325
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,110
or even all of these
some, most, or all days.

1326
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,450
What I'm about to describe next

1327
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,030
is going to seem so
silly on the face of it,

1328
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,083
but has deep mechanism to support it.

1329
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,923
Put simply, when you get
tired, your eyelids close,

1330
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,323
and when you're alert,
your eyelids are open.

1331
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:46,490
That is because you have
neurons in your brain,

1332
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,110
that depending on your level of alertness,

1333
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,193
will make it easy or hard
to keep your eyes open.

1334
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,230
Now, that's a complete duh,

1335
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,350
except that we don't often
think about the relationship

1336
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:01,423
between alertness and where we
are looking and our eyelids.

1337
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,270
Now, I learned this from a
colleague of mine in psychiatry,

1338
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,520
who happens to work on hypnosis.

1339
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,950
I'm not going to hypnotize you right now.

1340
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,350
That's actually for a future episode.

1341
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:14,550
But what happens when we get tired?

1342
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,173
Our eyelids close, and
our chin moves down.

1343
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,100
We tend to nod out this way.

1344
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,920
If you have ever been in a classroom,

1345
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,080
certainly not one of mine,

1346
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,940
but if you've been in a classroom

1347
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,340
and the lecturer is kind of drawing on,

1348
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,720
or it's the afternoon,

1349
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,300
what you'll notice is
that a number of students,

1350
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,360
their heads are jolt, kind
of their eyelids are closing,

1351
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,100
and their chin is dropping, and they,

1352
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,200
you'll see a bunch of heads
bouncing back up, right?

1353
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,590
I was definitely one of
those people in class.

1354
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,930
If it was post-lunch in the afternoon,

1355
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,630
it's warm, the hum of the air conditioner,

1356
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:49,263
or whatever it is, and I'm just out, okay?

1357
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,380
When we're wide awake,
the opposite happens.

1358
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,470
Our eyelids are open all the way,

1359
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,280
and our chin happens to be up.

1360
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,280
And no, this is not me telling
you to have good posture.

1361
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,750
However, what I learned from
my colleague at Stanford

1362
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:08,610
is that these circuits
actually act in loops.

1363
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:13,610
When we look up, maybe it's
because these melanopsin cells

1364
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,690
are in the bottom of our retina, they are,

1365
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,270
and maybe it's because they're there

1366
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:21,750
in order to view sunlight,
which is overhead, which it is,

1367
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,420
but that system of alertness

1368
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,620
is linked to the position of our eyes.

1369
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,550
So when we look up and our eyelids are up,

1370
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,550
it actually has a purpose.

1371
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,680
It actually creates a
wakefulness signal for the brain.

1372
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,330
And so, while this might seem like

1373
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,930
the silliest and simple tool

1374
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,300
that I might ever
describe on this podcast,

1375
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,870
if you are feeling tired, it
actually can be beneficial

1376
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,550
to the wakefulness systems of the brain,

1377
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,940
including the locus coeruleus

1378
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,050
and these areas that
release norepinephrine

1379
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,570
to actually look up,

1380
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,660
to actually look up toward the ceiling.

1381
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,420
You don't want your chin all the way back,

1382
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,530
but to look up and to raise
your eyes toward the ceiling

1383
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:02,970
and to look up and try and
hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.

1384
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,810
So this isn't looking up
and closing your eyes,

1385
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,150
like on a nice sunny day, that's relaxing.

1386
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,160
This is looking up and actually
looking up at the ceiling.

1387
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,720
It actually triggers some
of the areas of the brain

1388
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,430
that are involved in wakefulness.

1389
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:18,260
So if you're somebody who's
falling asleep at your work,

1390
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,260
this can be very beneficial.

1391
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:25,260
Likewise, many people are
looking at their phone all day,

1392
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,410
and their chin is down,

1393
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,900
and then they're sitting at a computer

1394
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,040
that's positioned below them,

1395
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,010
and they're having trouble
staying awake or focusing.

1396
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,180
It can be very, I tell
Costello this all the time,

1397
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,170
'cause he's always falling asleep

1398
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,410
while he's trying to do his work,

1399
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:42,920
positioning your computer
screen up at eye level,

1400
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,410
or sometimes having it
actually above eye level,

1401
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,150
can actually create
wakefulness and alertness

1402
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,440
for the work that you're going to do.

1403
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,270
This is simply because of this connection

1404
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,010
between the brainstem circuits

1405
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,380
and the other neural circuits
that control wakefulness

1406
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,970
and eyelids opening and looking up.

1407
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,520
Okay, so it, again,
it's remarkably simple,

1408
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,610
almost laughably simple, but it's grounded

1409
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:08,630
in some of the most hardwired,

1410
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:09,830
meaning present from birth,

1411
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,200
aspects of our neural circuitry.

1412
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,520
And norepinephrine released
from locus coeruleus

1413
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,990
isn't just a mouthful,

1414
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:21,020
it's a really interesting
and powerful mechanism

1415
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,650
for how the rest of the brain wakes up.

1416
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,290
Locus coeruleus hoses
the rest of your brain

1417
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,020
with norepinephrine, in order
to wake up those circuits

1418
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,240
for work and attention.

1419
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,230
And so, eyes up is actually a way,

1420
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,590
a route into increased alertness.

1421
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,530
Eyes down is a route into sleepiness,

1422
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,550
into reduced alertness.

1423
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,373
And I have only one
friend that texts up here,

1424
00:58:45,373 --> 00:58:47,520
like on the street
holds his phone up here.

1425
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,040
It looks ridiculous.

1426
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,340
And yet, you know, if we were trying

1427
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,140
to create more sense of alertness,

1428
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,340
if that's your goal,

1429
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,560
positioning computer
screens up high, chin up,

1430
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,330
looking up if you need to kind
of create an alertness signal,

1431
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,640
not always being chin down and texting,

1432
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,800
or working into typewriters,
or reading below us.

1433
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,470
is actually going to send a
recurring wakefulness signal.

1434
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,870
When things are up, we tend to be alert.

1435
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,190
When everything's focused
down, including our eyes,

1436
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,720
it tends to have a more suppressive

1437
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,490
or sedative type signaling

1438
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,180
to the deeper centers of the brain.

1439
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,170
Now, before we move on to
the science, and tools,

1440
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,690
and protocols related to pattern vision,

1441
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,850
I want to mention another
study that was done

1442
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,460
by the University of Pennsylvania.

1443
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,730
They have a terrific group
there that works on sleep.

1444
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,410
They made an important discovery

1445
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,810
that I think everybody should know about,

1446
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,950
which is that children that sleep in rooms

1447
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:44,900
that have a nightlight or dim
lights are much more likely

1448
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,563
to develop myopia, nearsightedness.

1449
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,130
Conversely, children that
sleep in very dark rooms,

1450
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:57,653
so either very dim
nightlights or complete black,

1451
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,460
they have a much lower,
statistically speaking,

1452
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,170
a significantly lower probability

1453
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,160
of developing myopia, nearsightedness.

1454
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,000
Now, why is that?

1455
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,440
It's because the wavelengths
of light that matter

1456
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,233
for these melanopsin cells,

1457
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,623
oftentimes can get through the eyelids.

1458
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,880
And that's particularly true for children

1459
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,810
and people that have thin eyelids.

1460
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:26,400
Some people, like me,
have very thin eyelids.

1461
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,983
I've been told this before.

1462
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,180
Not many people touch my eyelids,

1463
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,570
but among those that have,
I have very thin eyelids.

1464
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,830
I notice I have very thin eyelids
compared to say, Costello.

1465
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,240
Now, Costello's eyes droop.

1466
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,660
He can't even close his eyes
all the way they're so droopy.

1467
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,640
But many people have thin eyelids,

1468
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,700
and those people are going
to be even more prone

1469
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,280
to light coming in through the eyelid.

1470
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,580
So for parents, for kids, and for adults,

1471
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,980
you really want to try to get to a place

1472
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,410
where you can sleep in a completely black

1473
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,960
or dark environment.

1474
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,930
One little exposure to light, no big deal.

1475
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:03,650
But this ties back to the other protocol

1476
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:06,460
that I've described before in
the mood and sleep episodes,

1477
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,630
which is that viewing light,

1478
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,290
even a very low intensity

1479
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,450
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM

1480
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,490
is extremely detrimental to the dopamine

1481
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,150
and other mood producing
systems of the brain.

1482
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:19,760
It can negatively impact
learning, and immunity,

1483
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,220
and even blood sugar,

1484
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,400
and make people type two diabetes prone

1485
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,160
by way of communication
from these melanopsin cells

1486
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,700
to a structure in the
brain called the habenula.

1487
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,540
Why am I throwing out all this verbiage?

1488
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,450
Well, because people have
asked for more mechanisms.

1489
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,470
So, if you really want to know,

1490
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,250
when you look at blue light

1491
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:37,010
or if blue light is getting
in through your eyelids

1492
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:38,340
in the middle of the night,

1493
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,970
it is likely distorting

1494
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:43,630
this lens accommodation
mechanism in the eye

1495
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,260
and leading to myopia in some cases.

1496
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,427
So, that's one reason to
avoid blue light exposure

1497
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:51,440
and bright light exposure,
even nightlight exposure,

1498
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,750
in middle of the night.

1499
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,340
Viewing any light of bright intensity

1500
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,030
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM

1501
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,040
on a consistent basis is
going to suppress dopamine,

1502
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,680
because of the way that that light

1503
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,170
activates these melanopsin cells,

1504
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,770
and the habenula, and the dopamine system.

1505
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,680
So it's all very simple,

1506
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,290
get as much bright light
as you can safely, right?

1507
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,800
You never want to look
at any light so bright

1508
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,760
that it's painful look
at, during the daytime.

1509
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,960
Try and go without sunglasses,
unless you need them.

1510
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,110
Now, I wear sunglasses for sake of sport

1511
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,180
and sake when it's really bright out,

1512
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,040
but I try to get two hours a day

1513
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,370
of working outside or being outside,

1514
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:30,730
even if there's cloud cover,
that's going to offset myopia.

1515
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,330
It's going to help you get better sleep.

1516
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,310
It's going to support mood
and metabolism, et cetera.

1517
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:37,500
And at night, if you're sleeping

1518
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,560
with a lot of lights in the room,

1519
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,450
and especially, if there are
kids that need a nightlight,

1520
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,900
you should try and wean
them off that nightlight,

1521
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,240
because it's going to be beneficial

1522
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,310
for their vision to wean
them off that nightlight

1523
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,270
and put them into a darker environment.

1524
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,880
Obviously, you want to get
them emotionally comfortable

1525
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,480
with that first.

1526
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,020
Now, let's talk about pattern
vision, actual seeing things,

1527
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,040
like faces and colors, et cetera.

1528
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,280
I'm presuming that some of
you out there are colorblind.

1529
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,290
We can all help the red-green
colorblind folks out there

1530
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:08,690
by not using red in slides and diagrams,

1531
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,230
and on menus, and things of that sort.

1532
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,030
Try and use magenta instead.

1533
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,560
They can see the contrast
between magenta and green

1534
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,010
better than if there's red and green.

1535
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,160
So, be kind to the
colorblind folks out there.

1536
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,080
It's actually a fair percentage.

1537
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,960
And there are a lot of
different kinds of colorblind.

1538
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,310
I should just mention some
people are true monochromats.

1539
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,700
They see the world in black and white.

1540
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,263
That's exceedingly rare.

1541
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,150
Most colorblind people,
colorblind in quotes,

1542
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,900
are red-green colorblind,

1543
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,680
meaning they lack red cone photo pigment,

1544
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,130
meaning they can't see
long wavelengths of light.

1545
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:45,550
So they see the world much
as a canine or a cat does,

1546
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,270
where they don't get
the green-red contrast.

1547
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,540
That's why we call it
red-green colorblind.

1548
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,000
They have the green cones,

1549
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,030
but they can't do the contrast comparison

1550
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,720
that I described at the
beginning of the episode.

1551
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,450
So use magenta, and they
will be able to see things.

1552
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,440
You wonder why stop signs and stop lights

1553
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,940
and things aren't in magenta.

1554
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,410
Well, because the world is unkind

1555
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,800
to the red-green color blind individuals,

1556
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,860
and they have to learn the
position of those lights

1557
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,400
in the street lights.

1558
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,440
And they have to learn
the shapes of signs,

1559
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,360
which they can do readily,

1560
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,740
and it usually says stop on it as well.

1561
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,660
But if you care about
colorblind folks, which I do,

1562
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,290
then we could all do them a service

1563
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,620
by, I think by law actually in the U.S.,

1564
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,363
menus are required to be
colorblind accessible.

1565
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,500
How can you improve your vision?

1566
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,010
How can you get better at seeing things?

1567
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,980
Well, one way is to make sure

1568
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,390
that you spend at least
10 minutes a day total,

1569
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:42,330
at least, viewing things
off in the distance.

1570
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,420
So that would be well
over half a mile or more,

1571
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,760
try and see a horizon,

1572
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,110
try and get your vision out to a location

1573
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:53,103
that's beyond the four walls
of your house or apartment,

1574
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,700
or the doors of your car, and
the windshield of your car.

1575
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,390
I know that can be hard to
do, but it's very valuable.

1576
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,980
If you live in a city like New York

1577
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,860
and it's skyscrapers everywhere,

1578
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,130
you've probably experienced

1579
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:06,380
the incredible sense of relaxation,

1580
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,110
and it's aesthetically beautiful,

1581
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,270
when you are walking down
one of these long avenues,

1582
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:12,150
and you turn, and I think they have

1583
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,100
a name for this in New York,

1584
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,580
where the sunset is suddenly visible

1585
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,330
along a long avenue
between some skyscrapers.

1586
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,320
And it's just very relaxing to be able,

1587
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,750
suddenly, to see at a distance,

1588
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,870
and that's actually
because this eye mechanism

1589
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:28,180
of relaxing the lens

1590
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,310
and relaxing some of the
musculature around the eyes

1591
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:34,060
sends signals deep into the brainstem

1592
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,450
that release some of the centers

1593
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:39,100
that are involved in
alertness, AKA stress.

1594
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,920
And it's very pleasant for a reason.

1595
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,290
It's not a, it's not a
placebo effect if you will.

1596
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:46,570
There are a bunch of neurochemicals

1597
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,340
and things that are associated with that.

1598
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,860
So try and see at a distance,

1599
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,420
because it's good for your eyesight.

1600
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,060
It'll keep this lens nice and elastic,

1601
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,690
and the muscles nice and
strong that move the lens,

1602
01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:00,510
and it has this relaxing component to it.

1603
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:05,090
Now, our visual system is
exquisitely tuned to motion,

1604
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,130
not just our self-generated motion,

1605
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,920
but the motion of things around us.

1606
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,050
And one of the things that it does

1607
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,780
is something called smooth pursuit.

1608
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:18,780
Smooth pursuit is our ability
to track individual objects

1609
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,560
moving, as the name suggests,
smoothly through space

1610
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,983
in various trajectories.

1611
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,840
You can actually train
or improve your vision

1612
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,747
by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli,

1613
01:06:32,747 --> 01:06:34,030
and that sounds really boring.

1614
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,060
What you can do is, and
I'll provide a link to some

1615
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,110
that I think are pretty good

1616
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,440
that are used in various clinics,

1617
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,400
ophthalmology and optometry clinics.

1618
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,040
You can actually take
a few minutes each day,

1619
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,700
or maybe if you don't do it each day,

1620
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,930
you could every third day or so,

1621
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:50,490
and actually just visually track a ball.

1622
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,630
Sometimes it's moving in and
kind of an infinity symbol.

1623
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:55,070
Sometimes it's more of a sawtooth.

1624
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:56,720
Sometimes it's changing speed.

1625
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,820
Sometimes the cue that you're following,

1626
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:03,380
the little target, is
dilating and contracting.

1627
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,560
This is going to keep the
muscles, I want to be clear,

1628
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,440
this is going to keep
the extraocular muscles

1629
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,240
conditioned and strong

1630
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,500
and allow you to have a
healthy smooth pursuit system.

1631
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,540
Remember, the brain follows the eye.

1632
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,710
It follows the movements of the eye.

1633
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,900
It has to deal with that.

1634
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,620
And the neural circuits within the brain

1635
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,600
have to cope with changes
in smooth pursuit.

1636
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,580
So if you're doing a
lot of reading up close,

1637
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,720
you're not viewing horizons,

1638
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,780
you're not getting a lot of
smooth pursuit type stimulation

1639
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:35,190
from your life, or you're just getting it

1640
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,360
within the confines of a
little box on your phone,

1641
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,590
like your smooth pursuit is
over, you know, millimeters

1642
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,110
or what we always talk
in terms of visual angle,

1643
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:44,920
but the amount of degrees of visual angle.

1644
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,370
But if you're just
looking at smooth pursuit

1645
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,070
in this little tiny box on your phone,

1646
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,400
or on your computer screen,

1647
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,470
and you're not looking at
objects in your environment

1648
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,970
like swooping birds and things like that,

1649
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:53,960
which I'm guessing many of you

1650
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,600
are not spending your time doing,

1651
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,400
well, these mechanisms for smooth pursuit

1652
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,460
will get worse over time.

1653
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,610
Your vision will get worse.

1654
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,610
And so, while I prefer that people

1655
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,110
get out into the real world

1656
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:07,080
and experience smooth pursuit
tracking of visual objects,

1657
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:07,913
I don't know, maybe it's a good reason

1658
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:09,473
to go to a hockey game or, you know,

1659
01:08:09,473 --> 01:08:11,130
and try and keep your eye on the puck,

1660
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,180
which I can never seem to do.

1661
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,920
It moves so fast.

1662
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,569
Or I guess this is a good
reason to watch live sports

1663
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:18,829
if that's your thing, or
to watch a tennis match,

1664
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:19,930
like a cat, like a kitten,

1665
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,970
watching the ball go back and forth,

1666
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:25,080
whatever, watching kids play,
it doesn't really matter.

1667
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:29,990
The idea is that you want to
use the visual system regularly

1668
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,029
for what it was designed for,

1669
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:33,479
and smooth pursuit is a great way

1670
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,459
to keep the visual and
motion tracking systems

1671
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,840
of the brain and the eye
and the extraocular muscles

1672
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,149
working in a really
nice coordinate fashion.

1673
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,779
I would say five to 10 minutes,

1674
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:46,939
three times a week will be great.

1675
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:47,969
If you care about your vision,

1676
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:50,210
you can train your vision in this way.

1677
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:53,580
The other one is to train accommodation.

1678
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,880
There are a lot of videos out
there, I want to be clear,

1679
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:00,029
on the internet, some of
which are from clinicians,

1680
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:01,359
some of which are not.

1681
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,639
Some of which are from scientists,

1682
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,609
some of which are from other sources,

1683
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:07,039
talking about things you can do

1684
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,609
to make your vision better,
to improve your vision.

1685
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:11,809
Most of those are geared

1686
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,317
toward improving the
extraocular eye muscles,

1687
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:18,160
but I did consult with
our chair of ophthalmology

1688
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,020
at Stanford School of
Medicine, Jeff Goldberg,

1689
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,810
who's an MD and a PhD,
a phenomenal scientist,

1690
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,640
and a phenomenal clinician,

1691
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,399
and incidentally, a
phenomenal chairman as well,

1692
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,699
about what sorts of things, tools,

1693
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,229
are actually beneficial for
pattern vision and sight,

1694
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:37,639
because there's just so much
out there on the internet.

1695
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,990
Not all of which is
accurate or good, frankly.

1696
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,970
And he agreed that a
smooth pursuit stimulus,

1697
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,950
that kind of training,
as well as, or exercise,

1698
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,750
as well as near far.

1699
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,210
So spending a few minutes,
you might even just do this

1700
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:54,960
for two minutes of looking
at something up close,

1701
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,200
that's going to activate these
accommodation mechanisms,

1702
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,270
and then moving it at arms length,

1703
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,400
and focusing on it for five, 10 seconds,

1704
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,870
maybe more, maybe 15 or 20 seconds,

1705
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:07,510
then slowly moving it into
a location, and then out.

1706
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,740
This is actually a lot
like the visual training

1707
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:13,770
that's done post-concussion
to try and repair,

1708
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:16,350
actually repair some of
the balance, and motor,

1709
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:20,380
and visual, and cognitive
aspects of the brain.

1710
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:21,850
And we are going to have a guest on

1711
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,570
at a future time that,

1712
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:26,610
to deal with concussion and
some post-concussion training.

1713
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,750
A lot of post concussion
recovery and training

1714
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,420
centers around the visual system.

1715
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,840
Not just because people are
trying to recover their vision

1716
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,580
and their sense of balance,

1717
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,340
but because, as I mentioned earlier,

1718
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:40,520
the brain's ability to make
sense of its environment,

1719
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,880
and the brain's ability to parse time,

1720
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,840
not just on the day-night schedule,

1721
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,230
but also shorter time intervals,
follows the visual system.

1722
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:51,170
Something we'll turn to a
little bit more at the end.

1723
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:52,100
So what does this mean?

1724
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,750
The tool is, spend two to three minutes

1725
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,870
doing smooth pursuit.

1726
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,076
There's some programs on YouTube,

1727
01:10:59,076 --> 01:11:00,890
or you can just look up
smooth pursuit stimulus,

1728
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:04,270
and I'll provide a link to
a couple I like as well.

1729
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,640
You could do this with
a pen if you wanted.

1730
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,990
You could do this.

1731
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,040
Someone else could hold a
wand, and you could do that,

1732
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,580
if you've got someone
that can do that for you.

1733
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,310
Practice accommodation for a few minutes,

1734
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,850
maybe every other day,

1735
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,410
just bringing something in close.

1736
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,183
You'll feel the strain
of your eyes doing that.

1737
01:11:18,183 --> 01:11:21,010
I can feel it right now, move it out.

1738
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,550
You'll feel a relaxation point.

1739
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,240
Move it past that relaxation point,

1740
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,073
where you will have to do

1741
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:26,240
what's called the vergence eye movement

1742
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,670
to maintain focus on that
location as it moves out,

1743
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,100
bring it back in.

1744
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,760
At the point where you
actually have to go cross-eyed,

1745
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,980
this will differ for different people,

1746
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,870
depending on how far apart your eyes are,

1747
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,580
so called interpupillary distance.

1748
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,330
So for me, I have been teased before,

1749
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:41,520
I have a very short
interpupillary distance.

1750
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,340
I'm not a cyclops, but I'm heading there.

1751
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,070
Some people are more
walleyed, like a flounder.

1752
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,860
Well, depending on your
interpupillary distance,

1753
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,890
the point at which things

1754
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,910
get blurry and cross-eyed will vary.

1755
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,640
But for me, you know, as I get about,

1756
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,390
oh gosh, I guess it's about
six inches from my nose.

1757
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,470
It's really hard, I can't
accommodate any longer.

1758
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:04,030
I move it out another inch,
and everything's in nice focus.

1759
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:05,970
Try and see whether or not
you can get things closer.

1760
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,340
Now, you don't want to get cross-eyed.

1761
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,040
Remember what your parents told you,

1762
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,100
or my parents told me,

1763
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,350
that if you cross your
eyes, when you're young,

1764
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:13,550
that they can stay that way.

1765
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,080
Actually, they won't
necessarily stay that way,

1766
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,980
but your brain can
start losing information

1767
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,850
and the ability to see binocular depth,

1768
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:22,990
something we'll talk about in a moment.

1769
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:25,360
But for now, the protocol would be,

1770
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,470
you know, two to three,
maybe five minutes,

1771
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:29,440
just practice that,
practice accommodation,

1772
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,910
and then be sure to give
your eyes some rest,

1773
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,550
get outside, look at a
horizon, or do nothing,

1774
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,300
just kind of let your eyes go soft.

1775
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,140
I guess what the yogis
would call soft gaze.

1776
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,230
Just kind of relax your eyelids,
not this, not eyes closed.

1777
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:43,870
Just relaxed, panoramic vision,

1778
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:46,950
try and see the walls around
you without moving your head.

1779
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,330
Exercise your eye muscles,

1780
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,970
exercise the accommodation
mechanisms of your eyes,

1781
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,190
practice a little bit of smooth pursuit.

1782
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,630
You don't have to be neurotic about this,

1783
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:58,250
but if you do this often
enough, meaning every other day,

1784
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,740
every third day or so, you
can be the strange person

1785
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,770
on the plane or in the
classroom doing this.

1786
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,320
You know, that people might
chuckle or look at you funny,

1787
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,990
or tease you, but that's okay,

1788
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,810
because you'll be able to see

1789
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,100
when they are losing their vision,

1790
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,050
so you'll get the last laugh.

1791
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:15,050
Please don't laugh at them,
but maybe you can help them.

1792
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:17,243
At that point, you can
hold the pen for them.

1793
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,330
It's worth doing.

1794
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,240
It's really worth preserving your vision.

1795
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,630
And again, if you're a
young person, this is great,

1796
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:24,950
because then you can actually build

1797
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:27,290
an extra strong visual system,

1798
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:29,630
using all the tools that we're describing.

1799
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:33,190
I do want to talk about
a new set of findings

1800
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,960
that are related to red light

1801
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,000
and offsetting age-related
macular degeneration.

1802
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,980
There are a lot of ways
in which our visual system

1803
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,840
gets worse over time,

1804
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,070
but one is so called age-related
macular degeneration.

1805
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:46,210
Glen Jeffrey at the
University College London,

1806
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:48,800
somebody I've known for decades as a,

1807
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,340
because he's a scientist,

1808
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,450
has done beautiful work on
development and function

1809
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:53,283
of the visual system,

1810
01:13:53,283 --> 01:13:55,760
has published a number of papers recently,

1811
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,050
one that got a particularly high amount

1812
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,140
of attention in the press

1813
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,820
was one that showed that
flashing red light into the eyes

1814
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:07,090
early in the day, not late
in the day, early in the day,

1815
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:11,220
can help offset some age-related
macular degeneration,

1816
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,160
presumably by enhancing
the mitochondrial function

1817
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,730
in the photoreceptors.

1818
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,950
There does seem to be
some evidence for that.

1819
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,530
Although, it's still early days,

1820
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,820
I want to emphasize
you don't want to shine

1821
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,250
really bright lights into your eyes.

1822
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,580
You never want to look at any light

1823
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,900
that's so bright that it's painful,

1824
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,740
and you never want to force
your eyelids to stay open.

1825
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,020
If you need to close your eyes
in order to be comfortable,

1826
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,420
well, then chances are
that light is too bright.

1827
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,590
But doing just a couple minutes a day,

1828
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,780
like two minutes a day of flashing

1829
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,543
this red light into one
eye, and then the other.

1830
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,440
As long as it was early in
the day before noon time,

1831
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,110
and as long as it was in individuals

1832
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:48,900
that were 40 years or older,

1833
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,670
did seem to have a significant effect

1834
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:53,840
in offsetting some of the
age-related macular degeneration

1835
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,620
that would otherwise occur.

1836
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:56,900
Again, these are early findings.

1837
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,240
If you want to do this, please be careful.

1838
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,640
Please talk to your optometrist
and/or ophthalmologist.

1839
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,700
Your eyesight is precious.

1840
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,150
You don't want to damage
it, but it is interesting.

1841
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:07,500
And it does seem like red light

1842
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,310
can improve the function
of the mitochondria.

1843
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,870
These photoreceptors have
a lot of mitochondria,

1844
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:14,570
the energy-producing
organelles within the cells,

1845
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,740
because they are some of the
most metabolically active cells

1846
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,990
in your entire body.

1847
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:20,970
Your photoreceptors
are active all the time

1848
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:21,803
as you're looking around,

1849
01:15:21,803 --> 01:15:23,870
and even when your eyes
are closed, they're active.

1850
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:26,460
In fact, through a weird
twist of the biology,

1851
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,130
and please look this up if
you're really interested in this,

1852
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:32,580
your photoreceptors are actually
most active in the dark.

1853
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,413
This is so weird.

1854
01:15:33,413 --> 01:15:37,100
It's a twist of biology, the
way the system's arranged,

1855
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,150
that when light comes on,
they shut off their activity.

1856
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,300
So actually whether or
not you see something

1857
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,880
in front of you, like this pen or my face,

1858
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,350
is because the way your photoreceptors

1859
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,090
are turning off not turning on.

1860
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:50,280
It's a really cool twist,

1861
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,580
and I don't want to go too
far down that rabbit hole,

1862
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,150
but check it out if you're interested

1863
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,170
in how photoreceptors work.

1864
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:59,040
It's an absolutely incredible literature.

1865
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,680
Just Google, excuse
me, look up on the web.

1866
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,020
We are not partial just to Google.

1867
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:06,070
I happen to use Google,
but use your web browser

1868
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:10,300
to look up photoreceptors
hyperpolarization site.

1869
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,500
And you can learn a lot about that,

1870
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,190
if you're a real nerd for
this stuff, like I am.

1871
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:17,500
Okay, so red light to the eye,

1872
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,100
can perhaps, it seems,
help maintain vision,

1873
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,770
doing smooth pursuit exercises,

1874
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:25,370
and accommodation near-far exercises.

1875
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,890
Some people suffer from poor eyesight,

1876
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,800
simply because their eyes get dry.

1877
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,970
There are incredible, believe it or not,

1878
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:34,410
lubricating mechanisms for the eye,

1879
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:37,250
not just tears, but a thin sheet of oil.

1880
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,083
I mean, it's just amazing.

1881
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:40,030
Unless you have some
sort of corneal abrasion,

1882
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:42,730
the cornea is the clear stuff
on the outside of your eye,

1883
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,010
corneal abrasion, when
you blink, it's smooth,

1884
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:47,250
you don't feel it.

1885
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:48,700
It's just really, really smooth.

1886
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,920
And yet, if you've ever
had a corneal scratch,

1887
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,110
I've had this, it's really
rough, it is so painful.

1888
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,613
You have a ton of pain
receptors in the cornea.

1889
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:03,820
The lubrication of the cornea
is supported by blinking.

1890
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,090
And while it seems a little silly,

1891
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:09,740
some people actually
benefit from doing some,

1892
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,430
you know, five or 10 or
15 seconds of blinking,

1893
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,040
and then doing their focused work.

1894
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,510
Some people, their eyes are drying out,

1895
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:19,110
because as we focus, if
we're trying to do something,

1896
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:22,130
our eyelids stay open,
the eyes can dry out,

1897
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:23,760
but it also can make it such,

1898
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,430
that when we blink the next time,

1899
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,960
there's a kind of a need to focus,

1900
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,060
because there's some distortions
in these oils and liquids

1901
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,060
across the corneal surface.

1902
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,760
If you're somebody who
suffers from dry eye,

1903
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,310
I do hope they'll find a treatment

1904
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:36,440
or a cure for dry eye soon.

1905
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,910
There isn't one at present.

1906
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:39,640
Someone stands to make
a lot of money out there

1907
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,194
if you can find a cure for dry eye.

1908
01:17:42,194 --> 01:17:45,020
Let the companies know or start a company,

1909
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,140
right now it's still a
mystery as to how to do that.

1910
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,120
But blinking for five 15 seconds,

1911
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,520
probably slowly, not as quickly
as I'm doing here on video,

1912
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,370
but just, you know, maybe a
blink every a second or two

1913
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,410
for 15 seconds can lubricate the eyes.

1914
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:59,340
And that's not directly
related to anything neural,

1915
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,620
it's just going to allow the
optics of your eye to be clear.

1916
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,980
Just like when the screen
of your phone gets dirty,

1917
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,650
like when Costello's texting on my phone,

1918
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:07,740
and I pick it up, and it's
like covered with smudge,

1919
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,610
to clean it off in order
to see things clearly,

1920
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:12,090
the same thing is happening
for these optical devices

1921
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:14,140
on the front of your brain.

1922
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,010
Remember, these are brain.

1923
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,810
Okay, so a lot of protocols today,

1924
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:22,670
almost all of them behavioral protocols.

1925
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:25,937
I do want to talk a little
bit more about vision

1926
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:27,650
and how it works internally.

1927
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,410
And then I also want to talk about

1928
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,260
some of the foods and supplements

1929
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:32,930
that have been shown to support vision

1930
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,440
and offset visual loss,

1931
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,970
and maybe even reverse some visual loss.

1932
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:40,143
Let's talk about binocular
vision and lazy eye.

1933
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,670
I'm very familiar with lazy eye,

1934
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:46,290
because when I was a kid,
I went swimming one day,

1935
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,330
one day, and I didn't have my goggles.

1936
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:51,620
And so, something must
have been happening,

1937
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,920
as I recall, with the eye
moving down through the water,

1938
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,010
I've always had this problem

1939
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,620
that I can only do the freestyle
stroke off to one side.

1940
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,290
The people I swim with
are always laughing.

1941
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:02,430
Somehow, I kind of move toward drowning

1942
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,340
when I try and breathe on the right side.

1943
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,450
I think there's some asymmetry
in the way I'm organized.

1944
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:09,820
Anyway, I was off to my left,

1945
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,280
and my eye kept going
in and out of the water,

1946
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,450
and there was chlorine in the water,

1947
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:14,500
and it was making my own uncomfortable,

1948
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,603
so I just closed my eye.

1949
01:19:15,603 --> 01:19:16,520
I just decided, you know,

1950
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,053
I knew more or less how
to swim straight-ish.

1951
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,680
Might've bounced off the
lane lines a few times,

1952
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,290
but I just use the other
eye to kind of steer

1953
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:25,140
for that mark on the wall.

1954
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,810
Got out of the pool,
took a shower, dried off,

1955
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:32,580
and then completely lost by
binocular vision for three days,

1956
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,413
completely.

1957
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,150
The young brain, up until about age seven,

1958
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:40,300
but maybe even extending
out until about age 12

1959
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:44,260
is extremely vulnerable to differences

1960
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,890
in ocular input between the two eyes.

1961
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,530
My scientific great-grandparents
won the Nobel Prize

1962
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,670
for discovering so
called critical periods,

1963
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:54,010
periods of time in which
the brain is more plastic,

1964
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:55,530
more able to change.

1965
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:57,910
Those two guys, David
Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,

1966
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,110
thank you, David and Torsten,

1967
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:01,530
forever changed the face
of visual neuroscience

1968
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,860
and forever changed the way

1969
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:06,780
we think about treatment
of the young brain.

1970
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,350
It used to be thought that
you wouldn't want to do

1971
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,210
a surgery on a young kid,

1972
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:13,900
because of risk of anesthesia
in young individuals.

1973
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,020
But we now know that you need
to repair these imbalances,

1974
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,030
that even a few hours,

1975
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:21,040
okay, I don't want to scare
anybody, I'll talk about reversal.

1976
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,550
But a few hours of occluding
one eye early in life

1977
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:27,710
can lead to permanent,
unless something's done,

1978
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:28,920
permanent changes in the way

1979
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,330
that the brain perceives
the outside world,

1980
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,870
such that when that
eye is opened up again,

1981
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,460
the brain actually can't make sense

1982
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,440
of anything that's coming through it.

1983
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,630
It shuts down that visual pathway somehow.

1984
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:39,950
So what happened to me was,

1985
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,360
I actually was, my eye was fine.

1986
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,860
I got out of the pool, I opened my eye,

1987
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,450
but I couldn't see through that eye.

1988
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,400
Everything was blurry, double vision,

1989
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,770
unless I covered this eye,

1990
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,840
and then I could see perfectly fine.

1991
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,230
Fortunately, I went to an ophthalmologist

1992
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:55,240
who understood the literature.

1993
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,710
Thank you, Dr. Mark Lurie,

1994
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:02,530
who understood the
literature and made it clear

1995
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:05,700
that what I needed to do was
to occlude the other eye,

1996
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,500
the eye that was working very well.

1997
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,360
Clearly, he understood the
work of you Huber and Wiesel.

1998
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,200
Now, again, you don't want
to start playing games

1999
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,540
with this kind of stuff when you're a kid.

2000
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,850
If you wear, let's say you
have a Halloween costume

2001
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:15,960
and you wear an eye patch,

2002
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,000
you're a pirate or
something for Halloween,

2003
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,870
and you cover it up on one side,

2004
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:21,670
probably for the night
of Halloween, it's okay.

2005
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:25,150
I do not recommend doing
that recreationally

2006
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:27,210
if you don't need that
if you're a young child

2007
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,180
or for your child to do that.

2008
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:31,080
Because, indeed, you create imbalances

2009
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,750
in the brain machinery
that compares information

2010
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,910
coming in through the two eyes,

2011
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:38,020
and it can shut down
the neural information

2012
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,440
for the occluded, the closed eye.

2013
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,280
Now, I was able to reverse this issue,

2014
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,250
but my binocular vision
has never been terrific.

2015
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,770
I'm much better at the dart board

2016
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:48,160
and still not very good
if I close one eye.

2017
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,440
I'm much better at the pool table,

2018
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,320
if I close one eye, and
I still am terrible.

2019
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,740
I was the kid in, you
know, in the outfield.

2020
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,840
You know, the ball is coming towards me,

2021
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,210
the ball's coming towards me,
I'm going to catch the ball,

2022
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,540
and like it hit me square in the lip.

2023
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,020
My binocular vision isn't great

2024
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,780
as a consequence of this early event.

2025
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:09,960
And I have a hard time with
those binocular stereograms,

2026
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,190
those images that are kind of,

2027
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,250
you're supposed to look at them,

2028
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,510
and then the binocular
depth image like pops out.

2029
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,490
All the other kids were going,

2030
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,670
oh, there's the, whatever,
the Statue of Liberty.

2031
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:21,080
There's the [inaudible], and I see dots.

2032
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,630
Okay, so I have binocular
vision, but I use other cues.

2033
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:27,430
I use the near-far cues
that I talked about before.

2034
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,750
Motion parallax, the fact
that things are closer to me

2035
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:32,050
are moving faster than
things further away,

2036
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,780
in order to judge depth.

2037
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,530
And years later, when I got involved in,

2038
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:37,580
and I don't suggest this for most people,

2039
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,860
I got involved in boxing and martial arts

2040
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,730
when I was younger.

2041
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:43,480
You sometimes will see fighters,

2042
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,100
this is a slip to avoid getting punched.

2043
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,320
It's also generating motion parallax.

2044
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,690
Many animals judge depth
by moving their head,

2045
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:56,400
not by using other mechanisms
of accommodation, okay?

2046
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,220
So a lot of birds and monkeys and animals

2047
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,620
will judge depth by moving
their head like this,

2048
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,540
or they'll move from side to side.

2049
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:06,450
Animals that will undulate sometimes

2050
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:08,360
are actually doing a depth measurement,

2051
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,090
because as you move from side to side,

2052
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:12,540
the brain is able to do the math of depth.

2053
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,380
So what does this all mean
in terms of protocols?

2054
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:15,330
If you're a young person,

2055
01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:18,590
do your best to get really
good binocular vision,

2056
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,020
not just at level of your
phone or your tablet,

2057
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:22,100
but also at distance,

2058
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,710
you will build strong
binocular visual machinery

2059
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,867
in the brain and at the level of the eyes

2060
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:30,110
and the eye musculature.

2061
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:32,820
Now, if you're somebody
who did have an occlusion,

2062
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,170
what's needed is to cover up the other eye

2063
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:37,050
to create an imbalance,
so that the weak eye,

2064
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:37,883
the so-called lazy eye,

2065
01:23:37,883 --> 01:23:40,410
this is sometimes
referred to as amblyopia,

2066
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,090
that eye has to work harder.

2067
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:45,130
So for me, they patched this other eye

2068
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,260
and made this eye,

2069
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,760
eventually, I got vision
through that eye back.

2070
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,140
then they opened them both up.

2071
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,840
Now, you might ask,

2072
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,330
what happens if you cover
both eyes early in life?

2073
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:54,720
And this is where it gets interesting.

2074
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,280
You might think, well, if covering one eye

2075
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,430
leads to poor vision for that
eye after that eye is open,

2076
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,110
covering both eyes will
probably make you blind, right?

2077
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,130
Actually, that's not what happens.

2078
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:06,380
What Hubel and Wiesel discovered

2079
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,820
and what's been affirmed
many, many more times over

2080
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:13,210
in subsequent studies is
that it's competitive,

2081
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:14,930
that the two eyes are competing

2082
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,510
for real estate up in the brain.

2083
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,790
So if you actually cover both eyes,

2084
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:23,090
you actually extend the
period of critical plasticity.

2085
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,710
This is a really interesting aspect

2086
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:26,890
that other people are
starting to leverage now,

2087
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,480
in terms of how to reopen
plasticity later in life.

2088
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,790
But please don't, you know,

2089
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:33,080
go around with your eyes
covered for too long.

2090
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,130
There are some like retreats and stuff

2091
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:38,150
where people go into caves
with absolutely no vision.

2092
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,330
It creates hallucinations.

2093
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,470
We'll talk about why
that is in just a moment,

2094
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:43,130
but here's my suggestion.

2095
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:45,490
Try and get balanced visual
input through the two eyes.

2096
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,810
Almost everybody has a dominant eye.

2097
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:50,330
It usually doesn't relate
to your dominant hand,

2098
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:51,420
although it can.

2099
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,950
And so for me, if I cover up my right eye,

2100
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:57,000
I see much less well, much more poorly.

2101
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,210
It's a little bit fuzzy,

2102
01:24:58,210 --> 01:24:59,470
and I have to work harder

2103
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,560
in order to see the camera for instance.

2104
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,220
Then, if I cover up my left eye,

2105
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,910
it's actually really easy for me to relax.

2106
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:06,920
I have a dominant eye.

2107
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,250
Now, you can balance that out

2108
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,950
by covering up the dominant
eye a little bit each day,

2109
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,940
but I would warn any young people,

2110
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:16,000
meaning, you know, 12 or younger,

2111
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,130
against creating these imbalances

2112
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:20,410
if there isn't a clinical need to do that.

2113
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:23,740
And if you do have strong
imbalances between the two eyes,

2114
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,530
which can be caused by
cataract and lens issues,

2115
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:29,940
can be caused by neuromuscular
issues, et cetera,

2116
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,720
to try and get those dealt
with as early as possible

2117
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,410
by contacting a really
good ophthalmologist

2118
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,700
and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist.

2119
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,230
It is very normal,

2120
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:42,620
I should say, it's very common
for young children, babies

2121
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:45,390
to have an eye that, with strabismus,

2122
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,020
that either deviates
out or that deviates in.

2123
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:50,180
It is important to correct that.

2124
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:53,220
If you would like to
have balanced division

2125
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:54,530
between the two eyes and for the brain

2126
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,410
to respond equally to the two eyes

2127
01:25:57,410 --> 01:26:01,480
and to have, I would say high
fidelity, quality vision.

2128
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,890
Although some people who
have an eye that drifts

2129
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:06,610
can function normally in life,

2130
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:09,260
you have an opportunity
early in life to rescue that.

2131
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:11,770
I won't do, well, maybe I will do this,

2132
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:14,520
but I can actually relax this eye.

2133
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,160
It's so weak, in some cases,

2134
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,500
that it actually can start to deviate.

2135
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,410
Here, I'll just do this here.

2136
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:19,243
It's not crossing my eyes.

2137
01:26:19,243 --> 01:26:22,310
So I actually can move my,
I can misalign my eyes,

2138
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,960
because I have to fight very hard

2139
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,810
to have the musculature for this eye,

2140
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,770
keep that eye aligned with the other eye.

2141
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:30,980
And that's because I've
been doing eye exercises,

2142
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,390
since I was in my twenties,

2143
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:34,270
'cause I noticed when I would study a lot,

2144
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:36,280
this eye would start to drift
in, I'd start to see double,

2145
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,240
and I would then, next thing you know,

2146
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,317
I was just covering the eye up,

2147
01:26:38,317 --> 01:26:39,920
and it was getting weaker and weaker,

2148
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,810
just like the atrophy of a muscle.

2149
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:43,740
So I went to the doctor, what did they do?

2150
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,660
They did the exact wrong thing.

2151
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,860
The optometrist I went to gave me a prism,

2152
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:50,070
which adjusted it so that I
could see things normally,

2153
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:51,790
which just made the eye weaker and weaker.

2154
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,640
It's like putting a weak arm into a sling.

2155
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:58,750
So I had to spend at least
three years of 10 minutes a day,

2156
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:01,830
is what I recommend, doing near-far,

2157
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:05,940
covering up my good eye, doing
near-far with my bad eye.

2158
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:09,410
And now, it's been about 10, 12 years

2159
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:12,490
that I have pretty
decent binocular vision.

2160
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:15,400
Now, many of you aren't dealing with this,

2161
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,450
or have these early childhood issues.

2162
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:19,680
Some of you might be experiencing

2163
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,100
challenges with fatigued eyes

2164
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,300
or with differences in
focus with the two eyes.

2165
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,870
These eye exercises of
near-far, smooth pursuit,

2166
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:30,010
and checking for dominant
and non-dominant eye

2167
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,460
can be very beneficial.

2168
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:34,150
I'm again, I'm not a
clinician, so I don't want to,

2169
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:35,780
you know, give you protocols

2170
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,420
or enforce protocols on anybody.

2171
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,360
You need to figure out what's
right and safe for you,

2172
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,090
given your vision history.

2173
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,390
I do recommend talking to a
really good ophthalmologist

2174
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:46,690
if you have severe vision
problems of any kind,

2175
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:49,800
or if you want to offset
vision problems of any kind.

2176
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,210
An optometrist as well,

2177
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:53,960
but ideally would be a
neuro-ophthalmologist.

2178
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,630
Okay, I did mention hallucinations,

2179
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,697
and they're fun to talk
about and think about.

2180
01:27:58,697 --> 01:28:00,510
And for years, people have asked,

2181
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:03,320
why do people get visual hallucinations.

2182
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,660
Costello's in sleep right now,

2183
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:06,720
you can probably hear him
snoring, he's snoring so loud.

2184
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,910
He's probably having hallucinations

2185
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:11,660
about rabbits, pizza, and
those are mainly his favorite,

2186
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,493
and sleep.

2187
01:28:12,493 --> 01:28:14,413
He's dreaming about sleep in sleep.

2188
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:18,480
Hallucinations are a property
of the visual system,

2189
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,970
and it was always thought
that hallucinations arise,

2190
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,310
because of over-activation or activation

2191
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:25,860
of certain aspects of the visual system.

2192
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,450
I just briefly want to mention a paper

2193
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:28,770
that was published by my good friend

2194
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:33,070
and phenomenal scientist and
physicist for that matter,

2195
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:36,630
Cris Niell who's up at the
University of Oregon in Eugene.

2196
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:38,970
They studied LSD light compounds

2197
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:42,290
and discovered that
hallucinations actually occur,

2198
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:46,230
because portions of your
brain become underactive.

2199
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:49,050
The visual portions of your
brain are under-stimulated.

2200
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,520
This is probably why,

2201
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,580
when people go into these cave retreats,

2202
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:55,220
something I've never done, I
don't think I ever will do,

2203
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,800
where it's completely black,

2204
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,930
pretty soon, they start hallucinating.

2205
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:01,910
They start seeing things, even
though there's nothing there.

2206
01:29:01,910 --> 01:29:04,160
The visual system is desperate

2207
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,050
to make guesses about
what's out in the world.

2208
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,570
It's like the eager beaver of your brain.

2209
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,660
It's like, what's out
there, what's out there,

2210
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,270
what's out there?

2211
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:13,003
Even in low to no vision
people, blind people,

2212
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,580
they are, their brain is
going to be making guesses

2213
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,210
about what's out there
in the auditory world.

2214
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:20,780
What sounds are there? What
touch sensations are there?

2215
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,430
For sighted folks, it's going to be,

2216
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,970
what's out there in terms of light?

2217
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,190
Light is the dominant way.

2218
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,210
Vision is the dominant way

2219
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:29,270
that we evaluate the world around us.

2220
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:31,780
So it turns out that hallucinations

2221
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:34,250
are an under-activation
of the visual system,

2222
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,880
and then a compensatory, a compensation,

2223
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,010
by which the visual system

2224
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:41,060
creates activity and hallucinations.

2225
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,680
So if you're in the dark long enough,

2226
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,710
you start to hallucinate and see things.

2227
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:47,710
So, that's a little note
about hallucinations.

2228
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:49,890
One of the things that you
can do to improve your vision,

2229
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,540
and it's also kind of fun

2230
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:55,000
is to put a Snellen chart in your home.

2231
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,010
A Snellen chart is that list of letters.

2232
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,880
Or if you go to the dreaded
Department of Motor Vehicles,

2233
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,160
actually I'm up for renewal soon,

2234
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,610
so I love the Department
of Motor Vehicles.

2235
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:04,720
The Department of Motor Vehicles,

2236
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,330
they'll have you cover up an eye,

2237
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:09,470
read the letters on the chart,

2238
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,080
the letters of course
gets smaller and smaller,

2239
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,620
they're trying to figure out
roughly what your vision is.

2240
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,520
Cover up the other eye, you'll do that.

2241
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:19,620
Some people including nerdy,
vision scientists like me

2242
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,040
have had Snellen charts in their office

2243
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,300
or in their home for many years now,

2244
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,270
and you can just practice,

2245
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:26,270
and you can see how you're doing

2246
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,630
sitting at a particular distance.

2247
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:31,240
Your, this is something
that's not often mentioned,

2248
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,080
but your performance on the Snellen chart

2249
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:36,180
will vary depending on time of day,

2250
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,040
because your level of fatigue

2251
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,930
and your ability to
control that accommodation

2252
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:42,570
and other mechanisms of
the eye muscles will vary,

2253
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,550
so you can take it as an average.

2254
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,430
It's also a good thing,

2255
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:48,150
if you're going to get your vision tested

2256
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,744
for corrective lenses,

2257
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,560
or maybe you're going to do laser surgery,

2258
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:52,610
or something of that sort,

2259
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:53,810
if you're thinking about any of that,

2260
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,670
to really get it measured
by a professional.

2261
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:57,906
The ones that you get
in those supermarkets,

2262
01:30:57,906 --> 01:31:01,030
or in many eyeglass stores,

2263
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:02,260
apologies to the eyeglass stores,

2264
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:05,473
are often wrong by an order of magnitude.

2265
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,940
And then, when you start
putting corrective lenses on

2266
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:12,410
that are over-correcting
or under-correcting,

2267
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:14,240
but more often are over-correcting,

2268
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,220
well, then you're essentially
weakening the system.

2269
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,900
It's like putting a prosthetic on a limb

2270
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,760
that you didn't necessarily need,

2271
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,530
or robot arm when you didn't need

2272
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:23,650
the use of the robot arm.

2273
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,760
Although now there's so much
excitement about robots,

2274
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,670
I think people are going
to be doing that anyway.

2275
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:30,090
Nonetheless, get your vision tested

2276
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,130
by somebody who really understands vision,

2277
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:34,780
like an ophthalmologist or
a really good optometrist.

2278
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:38,087
If you put a Snellen chart in your home,

2279
01:31:38,087 --> 01:31:41,410
you know, you can do that as
part of your visual training.

2280
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:43,410
Now, this might seem excessively nerdy,

2281
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:46,800
but what is more important
than your eyesight, right?

2282
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,050
Eyesight is so vital.

2283
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,730
It's right up there with
movement and our ability to move,

2284
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,410
to generate, to get up out of chairs,

2285
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:55,280
and to walk and to run, and
to take care of ourselves.

2286
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,910
Eyesight and movement are the main ways

2287
01:31:57,910 --> 01:32:00,660
that we are able to take care of ourselves

2288
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:01,800
and take care of others.

2289
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,010
When you start having compromised eyesight

2290
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:06,700
or compromised movement,
people need to take care of us,

2291
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,730
and we become much more challenged

2292
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:10,360
in moving through our daily life.

2293
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,410
So while it might seem nerdy

2294
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,490
to have a Snellen chart in your home,

2295
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:16,560
or to do a smooth pursuit
exercise a couple of times a week,

2296
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,190
or to get outside for a few hours a day

2297
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:20,830
and do your reading or
your laptop work there,

2298
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:23,270
preserving your eyesight
and preserving your vision

2299
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:25,680
is one of the most life-enhancing

2300
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,970
or quality of life enhancing
things that you can do.

2301
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:29,640
And if you're a young person,

2302
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:32,860
and you can build some of
this into your framework

2303
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:36,330
of exercise or brain training,
if you want to call it that,

2304
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:38,690
that can be immensely beneficial
and will really set you up

2305
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:41,290
to have really good vision
over a long period of time.

2306
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:42,980
Now, of course, there are genetic factors,

2307
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,330
and there are injury-related factors

2308
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:48,530
that can compromise eyesight
and our ability to see.

2309
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:51,640
And, of course, the things
I'm talking about today

2310
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,540
aren't going to solve all those issues,

2311
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:57,030
but they can have a
tremendous, positive impact

2312
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:58,920
if you're willing to do
just a little bit of work,

2313
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,710
and none of this is
involving any cost, right?

2314
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,350
It's just time cost.

2315
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:06,870
So I want, I do want to talk
about a few other things

2316
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:09,400
that can perhaps improve vision.

2317
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,540
I want to dispel a few myths about stuff

2318
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:13,570
to take to improve vision.

2319
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:16,510
And then, I want to just
close by talking about

2320
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:19,840
how we perceive time using our vision,

2321
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,490
because that will nicely set the stage

2322
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:24,010
for what we're going to
talk about next episode.

2323
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:27,580
So now, you understand a lot
about the biology of vision.

2324
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,570
You understand that light
has to arrive at the retina

2325
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,060
and get converted into electrical signals.

2326
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:36,500
That process requires
things like vitamin A,

2327
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,560
a fat soluble vitamin.

2328
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,100
It requires things like the carotinoids.

2329
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:46,360
That metabolic cascade,
the biochemical cascade,

2330
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,850
is essential for vision.

2331
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,260
And this is why you've been told

2332
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,930
that carrots help you see better

2333
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,580
'cause they're high in vitamin A.

2334
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:55,390
There are a few simple things you can do

2335
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:56,870
to support your vision.

2336
01:33:56,870 --> 01:34:01,870
First of all, it is true
that eating vegetables,

2337
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:03,890
the dark, leafy vegetables

2338
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:08,040
and things like carrots that
have vitamin A in abundance,

2339
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,190
and eating them in
close to their raw form,

2340
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:13,410
so naturally occurring foods

2341
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:17,380
that contain a lot of
vitamin A in their raw form

2342
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:19,480
can help support vision.

2343
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,430
Now, does that mean that if you ingest

2344
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:23,610
super physiological amounts of that stuff,

2345
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:25,840
that it's going to make your
vision that much better?

2346
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,650
No, but you do need a
threshold level of vitamin A

2347
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:33,800
in order to see and in order to see well.

2348
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,600
Now, there's a lot of excitement nowadays

2349
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,790
about supplementation to
help support the health

2350
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:40,810
of the visual system.

2351
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:43,090
And I'm somebody who's pretty open

2352
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:45,210
to novel forms of supplementation.

2353
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:46,250
You've probably gathered that,

2354
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,850
if you've been listening
to this podcast for awhile.

2355
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,830
You have to determine what's safe,

2356
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:53,300
and economical, and right for you,

2357
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,710
what your risk tolerance is, et cetera.

2358
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:58,660
But I want to talk about a molecule

2359
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:01,730
that's in a lot of
supplements to support vision,

2360
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:05,950
and there are some really good
data on, and that's lutein.

2361
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,640
Now, the study I want to describe

2362
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:11,340
is actually published in 2016.

2363
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,040
It's from the Journal of Ophthalmology.

2364
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,100
It's a good journal.

2365
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,880
And the title of this paper is,

2366
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,410
it might catch your attention,

2367
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:22,070
it's "Increased macular
pigment optical density,"

2368
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,110
that just means that macula,

2369
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:26,950
is an area of the eye for central vision,

2370
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,113
for high acuity vision.

2371
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:32,817
Pigment density there is
good, you want pigment there.

2372
01:35:32,817 --> 01:35:35,717
"Increase macular pigment optical density

2373
01:35:35,717 --> 01:35:37,010
"and visual acuity,"

2374
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:40,387
Visual acuity is your ability
to see things in fine detail.

2375
01:35:40,387 --> 01:35:42,680
"Following consumption
of a buttermilk drink

2376
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,710
"containing lutein-enriched egg yolks."

2377
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:49,200
Remember, raw foods?
Lutein-enriched egg yolks.

2378
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,440
Sounds like a Rocky movie,

2379
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,767
where he would drink the raw egg yolks.

2380
01:35:52,767 --> 01:35:56,200
"A randomized double-blind
placebo controlled trial."

2381
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,500
Now, I'm not suggesting you
go out and eat raw egg yolks.

2382
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,630
There's the risk of salmonella.

2383
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,770
Although, I did hear this,

2384
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:02,820
someone correct me if I'm wrong,

2385
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:06,040
but the salmonella is actually
on the outside of the egg,

2386
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,950
not actually in the egg
itself, it's on the shell.

2387
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:13,330
For reasons that relate to how
that egg got into the world,

2388
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:15,140
that's where the salmonella lives,

2389
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,350
but I could be wrong about that.

2390
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,750
But raw egg yolks are not something

2391
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,960
that most people want to consume.

2392
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,280
What is this lutein stuff?

2393
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:27,580
Well, lutein is in the pathway
that relates to vitamin A

2394
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:32,060
and the formation of the
OPs in the photopigment

2395
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,860
that captures light in
the back of your eye,

2396
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:37,500
literally absorbs light
pigment in your eye,

2397
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,350
and converts that into electrical signals,

2398
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,570
and allows you to see.

2399
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:42,380
And there is some evidence,

2400
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,360
I spoke to our chair of ophthalmology,

2401
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:48,110
there is some evidence through
quality peer-reviewed studies

2402
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:53,110
that supplementing with
lutein can help offset

2403
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,290
some of the detrimental effects

2404
01:36:56,290 --> 01:36:58,800
of age-related macular degeneration.

2405
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,123
But, I want to emphasize
but, or emphasize however,

2406
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:07,140
only for individuals with moderate

2407
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,560
to severe macular degeneration.

2408
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,620
For people that have normal vision,

2409
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:16,620
or with a, just a low-degree
of macular degeneration,

2410
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:19,330
these studies did not see
a significant improvement

2411
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:22,020
of vision from supplementing with lutein.

2412
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,020
So, I'm not going to to tell you

2413
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,793
to supplement with lutein or not.

2414
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,480
I don't think any study
is holy, but it does seem

2415
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,650
that if you have moderate to
severe macular degeneration,

2416
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:33,840
talk to your physician, of course,

2417
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,150
talk to your ophthalmologist,

2418
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,650
I'll always say that, and
I'll say it three times,

2419
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:42,990
supplementing with lutein
could perhaps support vision

2420
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:45,040
and offset some vision loss in that case.

2421
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,000
Probably also talk to your ophthalmologist

2422
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,330
or consider the red light therapy

2423
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:49,750
that I talked about earlier.

2424
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:51,950
Whereas, if you have normal vision,

2425
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:55,550
or a low amount of macular degeneration,

2426
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:57,530
it does not seem, at
least from these studies,

2427
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,760
that lutein had much of an effect.

2428
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,860
Now, I know, and I confess
I'm sort of of the mind

2429
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:08,860
that if I personally had
age-related macular degeneration,

2430
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,730
or a propensity for it in my family,

2431
01:38:10,730 --> 01:38:15,560
which fortunately I
don't, but in that case,

2432
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,060
I would think that
supplementing with lutein,

2433
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:20,610
provided it's safe, could
perhaps be of benefit.

2434
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,470
You might want to consider
a low dose of that.

2435
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:23,840
So again, I'm not pushing any of this

2436
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,910
on anybody by any means,
but you should know that,

2437
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:30,500
under certain conditions of
severe macular degeneration

2438
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,860
or moderate macular degeneration,

2439
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,430
it does seem like lutein
can be beneficial.

2440
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:36,090
It does not have to be
consumed through raw egg yolks,

2441
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:39,900
although that is the
highest density source.

2442
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,670
Cooking the egg yolk, cooking your eggs,

2443
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,490
if you like your scrambled eggs dry,

2444
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:48,390
or you like your eggs not easy
over or whatever, not runny,

2445
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:51,030
then you aren't going to get
the benefits of the leucine.

2446
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:52,430
There are other sources of leucine,

2447
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:53,920
non-animal sources of leucine as well.

2448
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:57,030
You can look those up on the internet.

2449
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:00,830
Now, there are other
compounds that have been shown

2450
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:03,060
to perhaps be important for offsetting

2451
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:06,500
or helping different forms of vision loss.

2452
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,880
One is, I'm going to spell
this out, I-D-E-B-E-N-O-N-E,

2453
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,900
idebenone, idebenone, idebenone,

2454
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,433
I can never pronounce these
compounds, forgive me,

2455
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:20,460
unless I've worked with them.

2456
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,630
There is evidence that
it can be beneficial

2457
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:27,570
for Leber's congenital eye disease.

2458
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:30,020
I would definitely go on to examine.com,

2459
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:32,730
put in I-D-E-B-N-O-N-E.

2460
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:36,590
And for things like
Leber's optic neuropathies,

2461
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:39,670
which is a degenerative
condition of the eye,

2462
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:40,560
whether or not people should

2463
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,270
just be taking this stuff anyway
is still an open question.

2464
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:45,290
There aren't a lot of studies about it.

2465
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:46,870
A lot of people that are interested

2466
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:49,410
in taking things to support their vision

2467
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:52,193
are taking lutein as a
preventative measure.

2468
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:55,400
I don't pass any judgment
one way or the other.

2469
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,610
Typically, those supplements

2470
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:02,550
also include the zeaxanthins
and astaxanthins.

2471
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:05,670
Okay, the pronunciation of
this is terrible, I'm sure,

2472
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:07,050
but that's not too far off,

2473
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:12,050
but basically Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

2474
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:13,820
You can see why it's hard to pronounce,

2475
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:17,020
Z-E-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

2476
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:21,450
And the other one is
A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N.

2477
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:24,440
Both of these have been shown, excuse me,

2478
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,180
both of these have been shown

2479
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:30,860
to offset some of the disruption in vision

2480
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,770
that occurs with aging.

2481
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:35,320
What is astaxanthin?

2482
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,440
It's a really interesting compound.

2483
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:41,170
It's the red-pink pigment
found in various seafoods.

2484
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:43,910
So shrimp, I'm not a big seafood fan,

2485
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,060
but like certain fish, like the,

2486
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:47,230
you'll see at the fish market

2487
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:49,510
will have that red-pink pigment.

2488
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:51,770
And it's also in the
feathers of flamingos,

2489
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:54,270
please don't eat the
feathers of flamingos,

2490
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:56,343
and please also don't eat flamingos.

2491
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,520
It's structurally similar to betacarotene,

2492
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,040
so it's very pro vitamin A,

2493
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:03,710
but it has some chemical differences,

2494
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:05,900
which may make it safer than vitamin A.

2495
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:09,210
Remember, vitamin A is
a lipid-soluble vitamin,

2496
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:12,720
so it can be stored in our
body for long periods of time.

2497
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,360
What is the deal with this astaxanthin?

2498
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,490
You know, what are its drawbacks?

2499
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:20,790
Well, we can go to our
ever favorite examine.com.

2500
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:21,623
What does it do?

2501
01:41:21,623 --> 01:41:23,430
Well, it has a number
of different effects,

2502
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:27,830
a huge number in fact, but it
does seem to notably increase,

2503
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:29,630
it's now been shown in three studies,

2504
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:32,850
the antioxidant enzyme profile.

2505
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:34,870
It has a number of different effects,

2506
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:36,820
but the most notable for
sake of this episode,

2507
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:39,170
is the one on ocular blood flow.

2508
01:41:39,170 --> 01:41:41,930
It does seem to increase the
amount of ocular blood flow,

2509
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,720
so the blood supply to the eyes,

2510
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,120
so that makes it an interesting compound.

2511
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,930
It has a number of other effects.

2512
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:51,800
For whatever reason, it
also has a notable effect,

2513
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:55,610
several studies have shown
this, on fertility in males.

2514
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:59,640
So it seems to at least
double the pregnancy rate

2515
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:02,380
when men take astaxanthin

2516
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,920
and works as, in particular, it seems here

2517
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,640
in men that were previously infertile.

2518
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,050
So, I don't know if that has something

2519
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:13,150
to do with the blood flow
to the eyes, probably not.

2520
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:14,210
It probably has something to do

2521
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:16,670
with something unrelated to the eyes.

2522
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:19,140
Nonetheless, that's an
effect of this molecule.

2523
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:21,840
It's also been shown to
have positive effects

2524
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,310
on things like skin
elasticity, skin moisture,

2525
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,840
skin quality, et cetera,

2526
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,790
probably due to its effects on blood flow.

2527
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:33,790
So lutein, astaxanthin,
A-S-T-A-X-A-N-T-H-I-N,

2528
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,370
and for people who have concerns

2529
01:42:37,370 --> 01:42:39,430
about Leber's optic neuropathies,

2530
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,760
which is going to be a small
percentage of people out there,

2531
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,110
but that is a pretty severe condition,

2532
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:47,000
there are supplements that
are available out there.

2533
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,240
I do encourage you, as always,

2534
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,630
to talk to your ophthalmologist
and physician about them.

2535
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,650
And I will say that there
are a number of people

2536
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,170
that take lutein and some
of these other things

2537
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,270
as a precautionary measure, in
order to bolster their health

2538
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:01,570
in the same way that some people
take vitamins and minerals

2539
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:02,410
to bolster their health,

2540
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:04,507
and some people are
very health, excuse me,

2541
01:43:04,507 --> 01:43:05,910
and some people are very averse

2542
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:07,130
to taking vitamins and minerals,

2543
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:08,670
'cause they feel like
they can get all that

2544
01:43:08,670 --> 01:43:10,110
from healthy, whole foods.

2545
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:13,870
And of course, you can get
these things from whole foods.

2546
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:15,210
The question is whether
or not you can get them

2547
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:17,320
in concentrations that are sufficient.

2548
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,250
I do think that in the years to come,

2549
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:22,310
we are going to see more about lutein.

2550
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:24,270
I think we are going to see more

2551
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:27,363
about some of these other
compounds like astaxanthin,

2552
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:30,810
and hopefully by then I'll
be able to pronounce it.

2553
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:34,190
But, at present, these
things are more or less

2554
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:36,940
in the kind of experimental
or self-experimental phase.

2555
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:39,250
There are some good double-blind
placebo controlled studies,

2556
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,890
like the egg yolk buttermilk
study of all things

2557
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:43,530
published in really good journals.

2558
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:44,800
Journal of Ophthalmology,

2559
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,790
Journal of Investigative
Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences,

2560
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:50,440
these are good journals.

2561
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,410
These are journals are
peer-reviewed by experts.

2562
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:57,960
The study that I mentioned
earlier about keeping rooms dark

2563
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,910
that was also published
in an excellent journal,

2564
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:00,930
I think it was JAMA.

2565
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:03,260
I'll go back and look, it's
not on my screen any longer,

2566
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,880
but very easy to find,

2567
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,470
and there been some
follow-up studies as well

2568
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:09,650
from the University of Pennsylvania
and other universities.

2569
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:11,600
So everything I've talked about today

2570
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,850
relates to studies that were done

2571
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:15,980
and published in quality,
peer-reviewed journals.

2572
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:17,840
That doesn't necessarily
mean you want to run out

2573
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,980
and start taking this
stuff that I've described,

2574
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:21,680
or even doing the
protocols I've described,

2575
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:24,670
I've given you an array, a
palette, a buffet if you will,

2576
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:26,760
of things that you could
do to try and enhance

2577
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,420
or support your vision.

2578
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,100
Depending on how good your vision is,

2579
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:33,330
your family history of
vision and vision loss,

2580
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:35,050
your occupational hazards.

2581
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:38,090
You know, people that
work with metal filings

2582
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:39,630
that are flying out of machines

2583
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:42,663
are going to have a
higher degree of vision,

2584
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,550
you know, risk to their visual system

2585
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:47,110
than well, people who just do office work.

2586
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:49,000
Although, if you're doing
a lot of office work,

2587
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,690
chances are you're not getting
a lot of long-view vision.

2588
01:44:51,690 --> 01:44:53,010
Your accommodation mechanisms

2589
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:54,530
are going to start to suffer over time.

2590
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:56,690
I think we can reliably predict that.

2591
01:44:56,690 --> 01:44:59,570
So I've tried to give you an
array of behavioral tools,

2592
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:03,090
and we did touch upon some
supplementation tools.

2593
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,880
I'd be remiss if I didn't say that,

2594
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,190
because blood flow is so critical

2595
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,150
for the neurons of the eye,

2596
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:10,150
remember, these are the most
metabolically active cells

2597
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:12,800
in your entire body, the
cells within your retina,

2598
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,670
because blood flow is required to get them

2599
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:16,280
the energy and nutrients they need,

2600
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:19,410
having a healthy
cardiovascular system, right,

2601
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:20,450
doing endurance work,

2602
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:23,140
doing strength training work regularly,

2603
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:25,587
is going to support your
eyes, and your brain,

2604
01:45:25,587 --> 01:45:26,420
and your vision.

2605
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:28,900
It's indirect, but it's essential, right?

2606
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:31,770
It's necessary, but it's
not going to be sufficient.

2607
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:33,150
You're going to have to do other things

2608
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,890
to support your eyesight, as well.

2609
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:36,750
But having a healthy
cardiovascular system,

2610
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:40,150
because it's going to deliver
blood and oxygen and nutrients

2611
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:44,400
to this incredible apparati
on the front of your face,

2612
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,940
these two pieces of brain,

2613
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:48,460
is going to support your
overall brain health

2614
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,130
and vision over time.

2615
01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:51,270
So early in the podcast,

2616
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:53,060
I talked about how the optimal window

2617
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,720
for learning is 90 minutes.

2618
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:57,470
That's the so called
ultradian cycle for learning.

2619
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:59,510
That's why we had all our
episodes to about 90 minutes.

2620
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,880
They're now starting to extend

2621
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,710
into the hour and 50
minute and two hour mark.

2622
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:06,090
That simply reflects my
enthusiasm and excitement

2623
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:07,750
about these topics and
my desire to give you

2624
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:11,020
as much information as I
possibly can in each episode.

2625
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:12,420
Please remember you don't have to listen

2626
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:14,100
to the whole episode all at once.

2627
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,200
Everything is timestamped.

2628
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,980
Everything is captioned
in English and Spanish.

2629
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:20,250
The captions take a few days on YouTube.

2630
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,130
We apologize for that,

2631
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,190
but in order to have them done correctly,

2632
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:25,930
it takes a few days after it's posted.

2633
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:28,000
So if you need those captions,

2634
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,420
please check back maybe 24 or 48 hours

2635
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:33,460
after the episodes are released.

2636
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:36,060
If you're enjoying this
podcast and the information,

2637
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:37,520
if you're finding it beneficial,

2638
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,460
there are a couple of
things that you can do

2639
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,870
that are totally zero cost that
really help us and help you

2640
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:44,300
get this information going forward.

2641
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,780
One is, if you don't already
subscribe on YouTube,

2642
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,440
please do subscribe.

2643
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,840
We release episodes every Monday,

2644
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,550
and hopefully soon more often than that,

2645
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:53,220
shorter episodes as well.

2646
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,810
But every Monday we release an
episode, please do subscribe.

2647
01:46:56,810 --> 01:46:59,270
If you don't already subscribe
on Apple and Spotify,

2648
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:01,750
that's very beneficial, please do that.

2649
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,040
That helps us as well.

2650
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,950
If you could give us a
five-star review on Apple,

2651
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:06,800
if you feel that that's what we deserve,

2652
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,720
and Apple also gives you the opportunity

2653
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,680
to give us comments,
feedback about the episodes.

2654
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,700
If you have suggestions about episodes,

2655
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:15,690
feedback of any kind,

2656
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:19,150
please put it in the
comment section on YouTube.

2657
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:20,380
Routinely throughout the week,

2658
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:21,860
after the release of each episode,

2659
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:23,610
I cover content in shorter format

2660
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:26,307
and in more depth on
Instagram @hubermanlab.

2661
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:31,890
Every episode is also
indexed and searchable

2662
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:34,850
in the search function on
our website hubermanlab.com.

2663
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:37,850
That's also where we post
links to various studies

2664
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:40,660
and downloadable protocols, all zero cost.

2665
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,800
And as I mentioned, you can
search for different topics,

2666
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,230
and it will bring you to
the particular episodes

2667
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:48,040
that contain the
information on those topics.

2668
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,520
If you'd like to support us on Patreon,

2669
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:54,810
we have a Patreon account, it's
patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2670
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:57,430
There you can support us
at any level that you like.

2671
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:59,580
As well, if you'd like to support us,

2672
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,060
please check out our sponsors.

2673
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,220
The sponsors that we discussed

2674
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,610
at the beginning of the podcast

2675
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:05,650
are a vital way to keep the information

2676
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:08,023
being distributed at
zero cost to everybody.

2677
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:10,510
We only work with sponsors

2678
01:48:10,510 --> 01:48:12,630
that we really love their products

2679
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,050
and that we really respect the people

2680
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:15,560
that we're working with there.

2681
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,380
And of course, there's
no obligation to purchase

2682
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,970
or to even check out those sponsors,

2683
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:21,330
but if you're in a position to do so,

2684
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:23,070
that really does help us.

2685
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,560
Routinely throughout the podcast,
we talk about supplements.

2686
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,810
There are a lot of supplement companies

2687
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:28,970
and sources of supplements out there.

2688
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:29,803
The one that we work with

2689
01:48:29,803 --> 01:48:33,210
and that we partnered with
is Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2690
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:35,380
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency,

2691
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:38,320
in terms of what they say
is in their supplements

2692
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,430
is actually in their supplements,

2693
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,280
because it's independently
tested and verified.

2694
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,230
As well as the amounts that
they list on the bottles

2695
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:47,650
actually are matched by what's
in the capsules and tablets.

2696
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:49,700
That's a serious problem
in the supplement industry,

2697
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,510
and Thorne deals with that problem

2698
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:53,760
by being very truthful and very accurate

2699
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,250
about what's in their supplements

2700
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,840
and how much of those things are in there.

2701
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:58,700
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

2702
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:03,700
you can go to Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

2703
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:06,630
There, you'll see all the
supplements that I take.

2704
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,860
You can get 20% off any
of those supplements,

2705
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:11,350
as well as 20% off any
of the other supplements

2706
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:13,080
that Thorne happens to make,

2707
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,810
if you happen to navigate
into their website

2708
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:19,810
through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman.

2709
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,300
And last but not least,

2710
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:23,420
I want to thank you for your
time and attention today.

2711
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:25,970
Your willingness to learn about
vision and the visual system

2712
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:27,600
and the various things that you can do

2713
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,410
to help support the health and functioning

2714
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:30,830
of your visual system.

2715
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:31,960
And of course, I want to thank you

2716
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:32,973
for your interest in science.

2717
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:35,556
