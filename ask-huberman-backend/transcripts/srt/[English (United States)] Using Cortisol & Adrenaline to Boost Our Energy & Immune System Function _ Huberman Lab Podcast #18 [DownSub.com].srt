00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,930
- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,720
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,575
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:09,600
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,460
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,670
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,900
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,310
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,370
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,440
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,440
and science related tools
to the general public.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,730
In keeping with that theme

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,700
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,458
Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

15
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,170
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,900
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,600
to help you better understand your body

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,580
and reach your health goals.

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,710
I've long been a fan of doing blood tests

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,000
and more recently as they've
been developed also DNA tests.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,220
And the reason for that is
that so many of the factors

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,780
that impact our immediate
and longterm health

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,070
and that inform our health choices

24
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,680
can only be analyzed by
way of blood or DNA tests.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,210
The great thing about InsideTracker

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,820
is they make getting the blood
and DNA test extremely easy.

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,360
They'll come to your home if you like,

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,350
or you can go to a place where you can

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,870
get your blood drawn and
your DNA swab taken there.

30
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,600
As well once you get the information back

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,300
from InsideTracker, it's
very easy to understand

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,550
what to do with that information,

33
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,383
how to interpret it.

34
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,540
And that's really what
sets InsideTracker apart

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,830
I believe from other blood and DNA

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,160
testing tools and companies.

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,690
Most sources and companies
will give you information back

38
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,370
about what your levels of hormones are,

39
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,420
and metabolic factors, et cetera,

40
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,240
but no clear directives about what to do

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,480
with that information to get those markers

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,510
in the ranges that you want

43
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,190
in order to optimize your health.

44
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,050
InsideTracker makes that all very easy.

45
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,280
It gives you directives about exercise,

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,770
about nutrition,

47
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,030
about various supplements you
may or may not want to take.

48
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,350
And once again, only
through blood and DNA tests

49
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,420
can you access that information?

50
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,100
If you want to try InsideTracker

56
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,060
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

57
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,920
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,360
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,297
I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012.

60
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:25,110
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

61
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,610
I started taking Athletic Greens

62
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,600
and I still take Athletic
Greens once or twice a day

63
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,760
because it covers all my
nutritional, vitamin, mineral

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,340
and probiotic basis.

65
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,910
Of course, you can get
vitamins, and minerals,

66
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,530
and probiotics from food,

67
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,760
but many of us including
me find it hard to do that

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,240
on a consistent basis.

69
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,040
Especially when I'm working a lot,

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,680
when stress and sleep
aren't optimized, et cetera.

71
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,630
With Athletic Greens

72
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,600
I make sure to get all the things I need

73
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,140
and then all the other
supplements I take or what I eat

74
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,600
I can consider additional insurance.

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,990
The great thing about Athletic
Greens is it tastes great.

76
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,240
I like to mix mine with water

77
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,490
and a little bit of lemon juice.

78
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,340
I take it once early in the day

79
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,130
and then sometimes again in the afternoon.

80
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,850
The fact that it includes probiotics

81
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,280
is really important to me.

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,110
There are so many data
now pointing to the fact

83
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,730
that probiotics and gut brain health,

84
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,350
and gut health generally are
very important for metabolism,

85
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,430
for hormone output, for
neurotransmitter production,

86
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,140
so many vital things
related to our health,

87
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,240
Athletic Greens makes it easy to make sure

88
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,750
that I'm getting everything that I need

89
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,500
in the vitamin mineral
and probiotic department.

90
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,930

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,260

plus a year supply of
vitamin D three K two.

95
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,920
There's now a ton of data as well,

96
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,330
pointing to the fact that
vitamin D three and K2

97
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,840
are important for a huge number
of health related factors,

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,650
including hormones, metabolic factors,

99
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,360
neuro-transmitters et cetera.

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,140

and claim this special offer.

106
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,470
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.

107
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,980
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

108
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,310
I started meditating many years ago,

109
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,730
but I found it was
difficult to stay consistent

110
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,430
with my meditation practice.

111
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,390
In fact when I would get
stressed or really busy

112
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,029
that's when I probably needed

113
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,410
the meditation practice the most.

114
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,290
And that's when I tended to
drop the meditation practice

115
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,610
and run around doing other things.

116
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,780
So it was really a kind of catch 22.

117
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,440
I learned about Headspace a few years ago

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,290
on Jet Blue Flights when
they had them included

119
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,050
as an option of whether
or not to watch a movie,

120
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,070
or a television show, or do meditation.

121
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,160
I tried the meditation
and I really liked it.

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,570
Very easy to follow along
with a Headspace meditation.

123
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,150
The meditations that they
include on the Headspace app,

124
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,130
are also backed by dozens of peer reviewed

125
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,890
quality independent studies.

126
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,580
And of course there are now thousands

127
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,190
of peer reviewed quality studies

128
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,300
pointing to the fact that
a meditation practice

129
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,470
is beneficial for sake of improved sleep,

130
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,560
for reducing stress,

131
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,180
and a number of other health metrics,

132
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,290
cardiovascular disease, risk, et cetera.

133
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,950
The great thing about Headspace

134
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,690
is it's allowed me to
stay really consistent

135
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,950
with my meditation practice.

136
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,230
They have meditations
of different duration

137
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,450
and different type, so
you never get bored.

138
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,410
I actually look forward
to my meditation practice

139
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,000
and it continues to benefit me.

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,660
In fact, since starting Headspace,

141
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,700
I've been consistent with
meditation for much longer

142
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,530
than I ever had previously.

143
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,810
If you want to try Headspace

144
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,180
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer

for every situation.

148
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
That's headspace.com/specialoffer

149
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,840
to get one month free trial,

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,870
that's their best offer
out there right now.

151
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,110
And then you can try their
full library of meditations

152
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,600
for every situation.

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,620
Today, we're going to continue
our discussion about hormones

154
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,650
and we're going to focus
on how particular hormones

155
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,700
influence our energy levels
and our immune system.

156
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,780
Now, last episode I mentioned at the end

157
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,020
that we were concluding
our month on hormones,

158
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,092
but we decide to include
this additional episodes,

159
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,770
so this would be the fifth episode

160
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,070
in the sequence of
episodes about hormones.

161
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,160
Because there are two hormones
which are vitally important

162
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,610
for a huge number of biological functions

163
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,260
that we will talk about today,

164
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,050
but that are particularly
important for energy levels

165
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,270
and your immune system.

166
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,770
This is something that
I get asked about a lot.

167
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,940
So rather than skip to
the next general topic,

168
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,950
today we're going to
talk about the hormones

169
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,743
cortisol and epinephrine
also called adrenaline.

170
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,360
You do not have to have heard

171
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,980
the previous episodes on hormones

172
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,420
in order to understand
and digest the material

173
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,210
from today's podcast.

174
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,830
If I mentioned anything
related to previous episodes,

175
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,020
I promise to give a little
bit of quick background

176
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,860
to get everyone up to speed.

177
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,730
Today, we're going to talk
about the biology of cortisol.

178
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,080
We're going to talk about
the biology of epinephrine.

179
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,420
As always we'll talk mechanism

180
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,510
and there are going to be a lot of tools.

181
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,700
If you're somebody who
struggles with stress

182
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,980
and energy levels,

183
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,680
and balancing stress and energy levels,

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,480
today's episode is going
to be vital for you.

185
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,310
If you're somebody who
has challenges with sleep

186
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,580
or you're somebody who has challenges

187
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,660
getting your energy level
up throughout the day,

188
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,220
and getting your energy level
down when you want to sleep

189
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,160
today's episode is also for you.

190
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,420
And we're going to talk
about the immune system

191
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,220
and how to enhance the
function of your immune system.

192
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,160
We're also going to get
into some fun topics

193
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,910
related to learning and memory

194
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,180
and how you can leverage cortisol

195
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,200
and epinephrine in particular,

196
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,710
in order to learn faster.

197
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,490
we're going to talk about
so-called nootropics,

198
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,290
smart drugs and how they work,

199
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,280
because there's several of them

200
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,460
that tap into the epinephrine system

201
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,090
that aren't often discussed

202
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,750
and that you have access to.

203
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,100
We're going to talk about how caffeine

204
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,640
can actually rewire your
brain for better or for worse.

205
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,270
And we're going to talk about
the biology of comfort foods

206
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,180
and why they work so well,
and what they're doing.

207
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,700
And in understanding that

208
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,020
you'll be able to better
understand your food choices

209
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,540
as they relate to short-term
and long-term energy.

210
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,870
So we have a lot to cover,

211
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,310
everything will be timestamped.

212
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,760
I want to just remind people
that we caption every episode

213
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,810
in English and in Spanish.

214
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,690
The captions take a day or
two to pop up on YouTube.

215
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,780
So if you're not seeing those

216
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,380
within the first couple of days,

217
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,430
please be patient with us,

218
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,490
in order to get captions
that actually read

219
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,270
similarly to what I'm saying.

220
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,060
we go through a captioning service,

221
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,145
and so we have them done by experts

222
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:15,930
and that takes a little
bit of additional time.

223
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,570
Meanwhile if you have any questions

224
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,590
as the episode evolves
please write them down.

225
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,180
Please put them in the comment section.

226
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,740
Please subscribe to the
channel if you haven't already,

227
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,500
and let's get started talking about

228
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,100
how to increase your energy,

229
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,390
and improve and increase your immunity

230
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,710
by leveraging the biology
of cortisol and adrenaline.

231
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,210
Before we dive into the biology

232
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,159
of increasing energy
and your immune system,

233
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,079
I want to cover three topics

234
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,700
that I promised I would
mention from previous episodes.

235
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,040
The first one relates
to intermittent fasting.

236
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,610
The second one relates to
why your stomach grumbles.

237
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,200
I forgot to mention the
biology of that last time.

238
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,510
And the third is a powerful
way to increase growth hormone,

239
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,700
which is powerful for
increasing metabolism,

240
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,750
fat burning, and tissue repair, et cetera.

241
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,650
That doesn't involve a sauna

242
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,230
or wrapping yourself in plastic bags

243
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,090
and going for a jog.

244
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,930
So first intermittent fasting.

245
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,140
Last episode I talked a
lot about growth hormone

246
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,290
and thyroid hormone,

247
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,360
and I mentioned things like
sauna and exercise, and sleep,

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,870
and how they can increase
levels of growth hormone

249
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,840
within the healthy ranges.

250
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,420
And why increasing growth
hormone can be very beneficial

251
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,840
because it can burn off body fat,

252
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,050
it can improve muscle and
general tissue health,

253
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,430
cartilage, et cetera.

254
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,430
And we tend to lose,

255
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,270
or our levels of growth
hormone are reduced as we age.

256
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,337
Many people asked me,

257
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:37,460
"well, what about fasting?"

258
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,490
Everyone's been promised on the internet

259
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,760
that intermittent fasting

260
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,070
leads to these big
increases in growth hormone.

261
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,530
The reason I didn't mention it

262
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,780
is that I couldn't find a study

263
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,760
that actually pointed to
the underlying mechanism.

264
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,520
I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts.

265
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,370
Lots of degrees behind people's names,

266
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,250
sometimes biologists,

267
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,060
sometimes entirely different
fields talking about this,

268
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,080
but very few studies.

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,720
And then I found what I
would consider the study.

270
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,180
We will link to this study.

271
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,970
Turns out that fasting does
increase growth hormone levels

272
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,750
and the way that it
does it is fascinating.

273
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,490
I mentioned in a previous podcast

274
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,580
about hunger and timing of
meals and timing of hunger,

275
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,100
that when you're hungry

276
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,300
you release a hormone in
your body called ghrelin,

277
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,080
sometimes actually called ghrelin.

278
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,710
Thanks for all of you
ghrelinisters, or ghrelinisters

279
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,980
that corrected my pronunciation,

280
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,080
it's both ghrelin or
ghrelin, either one works.

281
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,640
Ghrelin makes you hungry,

282
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,270
when blood glucose,
your blood sugar is low,

283
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,450
ghrelin is secreted and makes you hungry.

284
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,260
And it turns out that ghrelin,

285
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,000
this hunger hormone actually binds

286
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,770
to the receptor in the brain

287
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,110
that normally binds what's called

288
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,540
growth hormone releasing hormone.

289
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,210
So believe it or not the hunger hormone

290
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,400
can act like growth
hormone releasing hormone

291
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,240
and thereby stimulate growth hormone.

292
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,890
Now the levels of growth hormone

293
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,000
that fasting promotes
through this ghrelin system

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,050
are pretty substantial.

295
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,230
It's about a doubling
of growth hormone levels

296
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,960
in the waking state.

297
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,430
So we know that you can release
growth hormone in sleep,

298
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,140
intermittent fasting it turns out

299
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,030
can increase growth hormone

300
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,040
by binding ghrelin to the growth hormone,

301
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,560
releasing hormone receptor

302
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,440
and it does it also during the daytime.

303
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,380
So yes indeed fasting can
increase growth hormone,

304
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,440
not to the super levels

305
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,280
that taking growth
hormone would increase it,

306
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,610
or that a sauna could increase it,

307
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,570
but it does seem to
increase growth hormone.

308
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,060
Later in today's episode

309
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,320
we're going to talk a lot about

310
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,700
different patterns of fasting and eating

311
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,580
that can control epinephrine.

312
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,630
And so we will turn to
specifics about how long a fast.

313
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,360
Do you need to fast for two
or three days, or 23 hours?

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,720
Fortunately for people
like me who love to eat,

315
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,970
that's not the case.

316
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,070
So we'll talk specific fasting protocols

317
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,193
later in the episode.

318
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,560
We also said, we're going
to talk about tummy grumble,

319
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
when your stomach growls

320
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,840
it is not because of fluid
sifting around in there.

321
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
A lot of people think,

322
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,130
Oh, you know it's fluid sifting around.

323
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,970
Turns out that your stomach

324
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,980
has smooth muscle that lines it sides

325
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,030
and when you eat something or you don't

326
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,210
every once in a while
your stomach cinches off

327
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,180
at the two ends like a bag

328
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,280
with a hose on either end,

329
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,850
'cause that's essentially
what your digestive system is.

330
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,070
And if there's nothing
in there what happens is

331
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,220
the muscles that line
the sides of your stomach

332
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,880
they kind of extend around the stomach

333
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,350
and these cables,

334
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,350
those are always there and if
you have food in your stomach,

335
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,990
what they do is they churn your stomach.

336
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,960
They literally turn the
muscles of your stomach

337
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,280
like a tumbler to help break up the food

338
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,060
that presumably you
didn't chew well enough

339
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,660
'cause you were eating too fast.

340
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,020
When you don't have any
food in your stomach

341
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,450
that churning continues.

342
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,970
And that contraction of the muscle,

343
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,500
the turning, literally
turning over of your muscles

344
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,920
they don't flip over completely,

345
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,110
but the turning over the muscles,

346
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,940
that's what causes the stomach growling.

347
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,240
If you don't want to be
the person in the meeting,

348
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,480
or sitting there at a in a quiet theater

349
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,650
whose stomach is growling,

350
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,860
chew your food better.

351
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,380
That's the simple solution.

352
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,250
And last episode, I talked
a lot about how sauna,

353
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,910
controlled safe hyperthermia

354
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,460
can cause huge increases
in growth hormone release

355
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,700
anywhere from 300 to 500,

356
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,470
even 1600% increases in
growth hormone release.

357
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,830
Really staggeringly high increases.

358
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,090
I pointed out that many people

359
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,750
don't have saunas in their
yard or in their homes,

360
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,880
and they would go through
some other measures

361
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,910
to increase safely their body heat.

362
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,030
You know, creating a steam
room in their bathroom,

363
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,150
or jogging with extra sweats
on this kind of thing.

364
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,890
Many of you asked about hot baths,

365
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,110
hot bags will increase growth hormone,

366
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,260
however the temperatures that you need

367
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,670
in order to increase growth hormone

368
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,840
are high enough that you
run the risk of burn.

369
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,870
And so I really can't
make any recommendations

370
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,703
about hot bath,

371
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,670
but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath

372
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,620
you are going to get some
growth hormone release.

373
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,810
However, the sauna has this advantage of

374
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,200
you being able to enter 175 degree,

375
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,810
or 200 degree environment,

376
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,910
provided you're not pregnant,

377
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,890
you're not a young child, et cetera.

378
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
You can do that safely.

379
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,390
And getting big increases
in growth hormone.

380
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,850
The hot bath will lead to

381
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,570
lesser increases in growth hormone.

382
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,403
We're going to talk a lot about

383
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,600
temperature regulation
in a future episode,

384
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,990
but as always if you're ever going to

385
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,610
start playing with
hyperthermia or hypothermia,

386
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,710
cold baths, ice baths,
hot showers, hot baths

387
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,690
that are beyond the kind of
norm of what's comfortable,

388
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,920
you have to be extremely careful

389
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,540
and please consult a doctor.

390
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,720
I think it's fair to say

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,200
that most people would like to have

392
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,490
a lot of energy during the day,

393
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,560
if you work during the day.

394
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,870
And they'd like their energy
to taper off at night.

395
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,060
And I think it's fair to say

396
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,420
that most people don't enjoy being sick.

397
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,733
Nobody wants to get sick.

398
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,840
In other words, you want to have energy,

399
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,860
and you want your immune
system to function well,

400
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,940
to ward off infections of various kinds,

401
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,140
bacterial infections, viral
infections, et cetera.

402
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,330
And it turns out that the two hormones

403
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,350
that dominate those processes

404
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,030
of having enough energy and
having a healthy immune system

405
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,840
are cortisol and epinephrine.

406
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,580
Epinephrine is the same
thing as adrenaline.

407
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,650
In the body we tend to
call adrenaline adrenaline,

408
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,980
and in the brain we tend to
call adrenaline epinephrine.

409
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,030
And I'm sorry for that

410
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,390
I didn't create this naming system.

411
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,670
And the story behind it is uninteresting

412
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,670
and not worth our time.

413
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,580
I will use the words
adrenaline and epinephrine

414
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,770
interchangeably today.

415
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,440
Cortisol is cortisol.

416
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,840
And I just want to
cover a little bit about

417
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,860
what cortisol and epinephrine are?

418
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,100
Where they are released
in the body and brain?

419
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,270
Because if you can understand that

420
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,893
you will understand better
how to control them.

421
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,340
First of all, cortisol
is a steroid hormone

422
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,920
much like estrogen and testosterone

423
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,690
in that it is derived from cholesterol.

424
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,100
Now that could be
cholesterol that you eat,

425
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,090
it could be cholesterol
that's produced by the liver.

426
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,360
As many of you probably know

427
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,810
the relationship between
dietary cholesterol,

428
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,440
the fats that you eat
and blood cholesterol,

429
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,770
and liver cholesterol is
a very controversial one.

430
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,680
It's a barbed wire topic.

431
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,610
There are people that claim

432
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,950
that dietary cholesterol has zero impact

433
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,330
on circulating cholesterol
coming from the liver,

434
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,340
and there are people who
argue the exact opposite,

435
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,240
both with good data in hand I would say.

436
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,760
There are some problems for the idea

437
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,450
that all your cholesterol levels

438
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,720
are determined by dietary intake.

439
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,520
Namely, that anorexics

440
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,730
often have very high levels of cholesterol

441
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,710
that their liver produces,

442
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,150
even though they are eating very little

443
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,980
and sometimes not eating at all.

444
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,390
So understand that cholesterol
is a precursor molecule,

445
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,630
meaning it's the substrate
from which a lot of things

446
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,140
like testosterone and estrogen are made.

447
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,490
Please also understand that cholesterol

448
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,720
can be made into estrogen,
or testosterone, or cortisol.

449
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,829
And that cortisol is sort
of the competitive partner

450
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,349
to estrogen and testosterone.

451
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,199
What this means is,

452
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,800
no matter how much cholesterol
you're eating or you produce,

453
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,730
whether or not it's low or it's high,

454
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,210
if you are stressed
more of that cholesterol

455
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,109
is going to be devoted
toward creating cortisol,

456
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,549
which is indeed a stress hormone.

457
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,850
However, the word stress
shouldn't stress you out,

458
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,270
because you need cortisol,

459
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,470
cortisol is vital.

460
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,250
You don't want your cortisol
levels to be too low.

461
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,500
It's very important for
immune system function,

462
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,320
for memory, for not getting depressed.

463
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,160
You just don't want your
cortisol levels to be too high

464
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,700
and you don't want them to be elevated

465
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,950
even to normal levels at
the wrong time of day.

466
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,020
So we're going to talk how to control

467
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,863
the timing and level of your cortisol.

468
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,320
Epinephrine or adrenaline has
also been demonized a bit.

469
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,610
We think of it as the stress hormone,

470
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,010
this thing that makes us
anxious, fight or flight.

471
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,620
You know, we used to get chased by lions

472
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,710
and tigers, and bears, and now we don't.

473
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,300
and it's this ancient
hangover, that's all wrong.

474
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,250
The fact of the matter is the epinephrine

475
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,000
is your best friend when
it comes to your immunity,

476
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,890
when it comes to protecting
you from infection.

477
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,650
And we're going to talk about why,

478
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,070
and epinephrine adrenaline
is your best friend

479
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,800
when it comes to remembering things

480
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,510
and learning and
activating neuroplasticity.

481
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,980
We're going to talk about that as well.

482
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,280
Once again, it's a question
of how much and how long

483
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,080
and the specific timing of release

484
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,490
of cortisol and epinephrine,

485
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,620
as opposed to cortisol and
adrenaline being good or bad.

486
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,300
They're terrific when they're regulated,

487
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,450
they are terrible when
they're misregulated.

488
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,940
And we will give you lots of
tools to regulate them better.

489
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,663
Cortisol biology 101 in
less than two minutes.

490
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,460
Your brain makes what we
call releasing hormones

491
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,470
and in this case, there's
corticotropin releasing hormone.

492
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,220
CRH is made by neurons in your brain,

493
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,140
it causes the pituitary,

494
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,860
this gland that sits about

495
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,660
an inch in front of the roof of your mouth

496
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,313
and the base of your
brain to release ACTH.

497
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,010
ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals,

498
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,980
which sit above your
kidneys in your lower back

499
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,880
to release cortisol.

500
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,440
A so-called stress hormone,

501
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,730
but I would like you
to think about cortisol

502
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,200
not as a stress hormone
but as a hormone of energy.

503
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,340
It produces a situation
in the brain and body

504
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,100
whereby you want to move,

505
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,130
and whereby you don't want to rest,

506
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,163
and whereby you don't want
to eat at least at first.

507
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,253
Epinephrine or adrenaline
101 in less than two minutes.

508
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,530
When you sense a stressor with your mind

509
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,700
or your body senses a stressor

510
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,650
from a wound or something of that sort.

511
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,760
A signal is sent to neurons

512
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,180
that are in the middle of your body.

513
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,960
They are called the
sympathetic chain ganglia.

514
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,850
The name doesn't necessarily matter.

515
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,830
They release Norepinephrine very quickly.

516
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,260
It's almost like a sprinkler system

517
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,913
that just hoses your
body with epinephrine.

518
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,800
That will increase heart rate,

519
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,540
will increase breathing rate.

520
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,940
In some cases it will
constrict your blood vessels,

521
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,460
it will also increase the
size of vessels and arteries

522
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,000
that are giving blood
flow to your vital organs.

523
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,340
This is why your extremities
get cold when you're stressed

524
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,630
and your heart is beating faster.

525
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,920
More of that energy is being
devoted toward your core.

526
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,513
You also release adrenaline
from your adrenals,

527
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,913
again riding on top of your kidneys.

528
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,560
Those are second system

529
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,890
whereby your system gets flooded
with adrenaline in pulses.

530
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,610
So you can get one pulse,
you can get 10 pulses.

531
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,350
We'll talk about how to
regulate the number of pulses

532
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,210
and you release it from
an area of your brain

533
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,830
called locus coeruleus,

534
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,410
and that creates alertness in your brain.

535
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,930
If you want to learn more
about the stress response

536
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,270
and all the details of that,

537
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,450
including some protocols
of how to regulate stress

538
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,360
please see our episode about stress.

539
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,400
I go into a lot of detail there.

540
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,590
I will touch on some of
the same themes today,

541
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,693
but I really want to cover
energy and the immune system.

542
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,000
And if you're very much interested

543
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,940
in stress per say and stress regulation,

544
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,713
please see the episode on stress.

545
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,210
Okay. So we have cortisol
and we have epinephrine,

546
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,430
and their net effect
is to increase energy.

547
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,530
So first of all, I want to give you a tool

548
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,530
that will help you regulate cortisol

549
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,610
and can also help stave off

550
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,130
certain patterns of mental illness.

551
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,400
Now of course it's not going to
cure mental illness on its own,

552
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,390
but it can support healthy state of mind,

553
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,740
and can help reduce
unhealthy states of mind,

554
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,300
including depression.

555
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,010
So the first tool is to make sure

556
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,450
that your highest levels of cortisol

557
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,000
are first thing in the
morning when you wake up.

558
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,440
One way or another every 24 hours

559
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,560
you will get an increase in cortisol.

560
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,423
That is non-negotiable that
is written into your genome.

561
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,470
That increasing cortisol
is there to wake you up

562
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,030
and to make you alert,

563
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,070
it's to stimulate
movement from being sleep,

564
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,940
presumably horizontal,

565
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,030
to getting up and starting
to move about your day.

566
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,500
And I've said it before,
but I will say it again

567
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,110
the best way to stimulate that

568
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,560
increase in cortisol
at the appropriate time

569
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,740
is that very soon after waking

570
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,340
within 30 minutes or so after waking,

571
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,510
get outside view some sunlight,

572
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,680
even if it's overcast,

573
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,080
get outside view some
sunlight, no sunglasses.

574
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,650
Never look at any light so bright

575
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,590
that it could damage your eyes,

576
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,100
but do that for two to 10 minutes.

577
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,350
If it's very bright two minutes,

578
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,690
if it's not so bright 10 minutes.

579
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,760
Do that, because in the
early part of the day

580
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,290
you have the opportunity to
time that cortisol release

581
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,780
to the early part of the day,

582
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,940
which will improve,

583
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,680
this has been backed by
peer reviewed studies,

584
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,330
it will improve your focus,

585
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,490
it will improve your energy levels,

586
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,500
and it will improve your
learning throughout the day.

587
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,500
It will also prevent a late
shift in cortisol increase.

588
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,280
And late shifted cortisol,

589
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,180
meaning cortisol that increases
around 8:00 or 9:00 PM

590
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,800
is a signature feature of
many depressive disorders,

591
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,580
including major depression, anxiety.

592
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,770
And that of course correlates

593
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,780
with things like insomnia, et cetera.

594
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,830
So that's a key tool,

595
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,620
and I don't know how many of
you are already doing that,

596
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,450
but it is vital to do.

597
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,390
Now I mentioned sunlight
even on cloudy days

598
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,950
and there are specific reasons for that.

599
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,050
So I want to just briefly cover the data

600
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,730
because in the episodes on sleep,

601
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,260
I talked about brightness of light

602
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,630
in regulating cortisol and sleep.

603
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,920
And I talked about how to
measure lux, brightness,

604
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,940
but I was not specific enough I realized

605
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,470
based on the questions that I've received

606
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,550
since that episode.

607
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,190
So here's how it works,

608
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,140
going outside and getting some sunlight

609
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,210
requires that I also tell you how long

610
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,270
and under what conditions.

611
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,470
I've said looking through
a window is not as good,

612
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,900
it takes 50 times longer

613
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,050
to get as much light,
et cetera, et cetera.

614
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,240
Many, many questions have told me

615
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,670
that I'm not being specific enough.

616
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,150
So I'm going to give you the data

617
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,830
and from the data you will understand

618
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,700
exactly how long you
need to do this each day.

619
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,480
On a sunny day, so no cloud cover,

620
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,970
provided that the sun is not yet overhead.

621
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,650
It's somewhere low in the sky

622
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,940
could have just crossed the horizon,

623
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,030
or if you wake up a little bit later

624
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,830
it could be somewhat low in the sky.

625
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,740
Basically the intensity
of light, the brightness,

626
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,000
is somewhere around 100,000 Lux.

627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,230
Lux is just a measurement of brightness.

628
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,500
If you want to download
the app Light Meter,

629
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,550
that is a free app that
will allow you to do that.

630
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,370
You can hold your finger down
on the little button there

631
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,520
and you can move it around,

632
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,330
and it will continuously
give you a Lux read out.

633
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,380
It's not perfect, it's not
exact, but it's pretty good.

634
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,300
and it is zero cost.

635
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,300
I have no relationship to
Light Meter the company.

636
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,780
On a cloudy day it's about 10,000 Lux.

637
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,240
Okay. So tenfold reduction.

638
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,850
But bright artificial light,

639
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,010
very bright artificial light

640
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,533
is somewhere around 1000 lux.

641
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,403
And ordinary room light is
somewhere around 100-200 lux.

642
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,960
And it has to do with how
much light scatter there is.

643
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,470
So even if you have a very bright bulb

644
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,370
sitting right next to you,

645
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,740
that's not going to do the job.

646
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,390
Your phone will not do the
job not early in the day

647
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,700
to get the cortisol released
at the appropriate time

648
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,410
you need to get outside.

649
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,710
So let's just set a
couple general parameters.

650
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,380
If it's bright outside and no cloud cover

651
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,750
that light can be indirect.

652
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,060
You don't have to be staring into the sun,

653
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,380
please don't damage your eyes.

654
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,280
We can't regenerate those neurons yet

655
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,090
and restore vision that's lost,

656
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,470
but if you have to blink,
that means it's too bright.

657
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,860
It's fine to blink of course,
please do if you need to.

658
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,483
Get outside for 10 minutes,

659
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,250
or five minutes should suffice,

660
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,680
but 10 minutes is sure to suffice.

661
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,280
If it's a cloudy day, dense overcast,

662
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,370
you're probably going to
need about 30 minutes.

663
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,180
If it's light cloud broken cloud cover

664
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,260
it's probably going to be somewhere
between 10 and 20 minutes.

665
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,560
And if you can't get outside

666
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,060
or you're on an airplane
and it's bright overhead,

667
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,560
artificial lights or ordinary room lights

668
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,290
it's going to take you
about six hours of light.

669
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,800
And by time you reach the middle of your

670
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,790
sort of wakeful period, it's too late.

671
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,040
You won't be able to shift your clock

672
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,380
and your cortisol will start
drifting later and later.

673
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,180
This is why it's vital to get
this light on a regular basis,

674
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,730
to get that cortisol
released early in the day.

675
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,600
That sets you up for
optimal levels of energy,

676
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,480
it sets you up for great sleep.

677
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,790
But today's not really about sleep

678
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,010
it's more about energy that cortisol pulse

679
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,050
and the stress that you
might feel early in the day

680
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,730
from having a little bit extra energy.

681
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,120
That is the energy that you want

682
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,930
in order to move about and
learn, and do various things.

683
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,130
That is a healthy level of energy.

684
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,170
So please try and get that sunlight.

685
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,730
If it's within your protocols to do that,

686
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,190
and try and get sufficient sunlight

687
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,310
first thing in the morning,

688
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,510
again within the first hour.

689
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,820
That's the best way to make sure

690
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,310
that you time your cortisol appropriately.

691
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,210
Now throughout the day

692
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,890
you're going to experience
different things.

693
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,900
Most of you are not
spending your entire day

694
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,580
trying to optimize your health.

695
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,440
Some of you might be,

696
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,270
but most of you have jobs
and you have families,

697
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,560
and you have commitments.

698
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,030
Life enters the picture
and provides you stressors,

699
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,660
and those stressors, whatever
they may happen to be,

700
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,930
a difficult coworker,

701
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,230
some disappointment about something,

702
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,740
you didn't get the raise you expected,

703
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,300
or you didn't get the
vacation that you expected.

704
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,820
Those will cause increases
in cortisol and epinephrine.

705
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,540
This is important to understand,

706
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,510
you don't have the luxury

707
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,190
of just having this morning cortisol

708
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,610
and then having a taper off.

709
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,910
You want that major
cortisol early in the day

710
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,370
but then you can expect,

711
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,910
you should expect increases
in cortisol and adrenaline

712
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,990
throughout the day

713
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,220
based on events that
are unpleasant to you.

714
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,440
So for me, the events that
are most unpleasant to me

715
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,430
are things like traffic,

716
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,610
emails that ask me to fill out a form

717
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,150
for which I can't find the link.

718
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,700
These kinds of things stress me out,

719
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,880
I'm a human being.

720
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,410
I don't lose my cool over them

721
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,010
but I can feel my level of alertness

722
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,380
and kind of frustration increased.

723
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,470
The normal kind of things
that go with stress

724
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,603
tense up a little bit.

725
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,090
The key is these blips in
cortisol and epinephrine

726
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,890
need to be brief.

727
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,960
You can't have them so
often or lasting so long

728
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,410
that you are in a state of
chronic cortisol elevation

729
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,000
or chronic epinephrine elevation.

730
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,560
This system of stress was designed

731
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,230
to increase your alertness and
mobilize you towards things,

732
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,040
get you frustrated,

733
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,460
and provide the opportunity
to change behavior.

734
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,620
That's what they were designed to do.

735
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,580
So if you find yourself getting stressed

736
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,820
and staying stressed,

737
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,760
there are great tools that we
provide in the stress episode

738
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,440
that relate to things like
the double inhale exhale,

739
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,010
the so-called physiological sigh.

740
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,250
You can incorporate NSDR,

741
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,140
in non sleep deep rest
protocol, et cetera.

742
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,630
But understand that the energy

743
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,230
that you experienced during stress,

744
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,980
that sudden increase in
alertness and attention

745
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,950
that comes from seeing
something difficult.

746
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,300
That is a healthy hormonal system

747
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,700
and neural system that's working.

748
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,760
And the reason it works is that cortisol

749
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,520
when it's released into the bloodstream

750
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,950
it actually can bind to
receptors in the brain.

751
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,700
It can bind receptors in the amygdala,

752
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,400
fear centers and threat detection centers,

753
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,390
but also areas of the
brain that are involved

754
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,390
in learning, and memory,
and neuroplasticity.

755
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,590
And this is why I say
that neuroplasticity,

756
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,930
the brain's ability to change itself

757
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,920
in response to experience

758
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,020
is first stimulated by attention and focus

759
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,070
and often a low-level state of agitation.

760
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,360
So understand that,

761
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,730
and you won't be quite so troubled about

762
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,090
the little stress increases

763
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,170
that you experience throughout the day.

764
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,680
Now, there are ways to leverage stress,

765
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,240
epinephrine and cortisol
in ways that serve you

766
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,060
and to do it in a deliberate way.

767
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,340
There are also ways to do that

768
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,090
that increase your level
of stress threshold,

769
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,950
meaning they make it less likely

770
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,980
that epinephrine and
cortisol will be released.

771
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,170
So I want to talk about the
science of those practices,

772
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,470
'cause I get asked about
these practices a lot.

773
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,250
Things like Wim Hof breathing

774
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,030
which is also called tummo breathing.

775
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,370
Things like ice baths.

776
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,150
Things like high intensity
interval training.

777
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,903
All of those things have utility.

778
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,850
The question is how you use them

779
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,130
and how often you use them.

780
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,530
Those tools just like
stress from a life event

781
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,320
can either enhance your
immunity or deplete it.

782
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,980
That's right those same practices

783
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,300
of ice baths, tummo breathing,

784
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,600
high intensity interval
training, or training of any kind

785
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,450
can deplete your immune
system or it can improve them.

786
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,200
Excuse me, they can improve it,

787
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,010
meaning they can improve
your immune system.

788
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,240
The key is how often
you use them and when,

789
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,900
and so I want to review that now

790
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,070
in light of the scientific literature,

791
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,410
because in doing that
you can build practices

792
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,230
into your daily or maybe
every other day routine

793
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,880
that can really help buffer you

794
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,970
against unhealthy levels of
cortisol and epinephrine.

795
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,610
Meaning cortisol increases
that are much too great,

796
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,350
or that lasts much too long.

797
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,610
Epinephrine increases
that are much too great,

798
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,360
or that last much too long.

799
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,490
And of course we'll talk
about all the negatives

800
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,370
that go along with
having too much cortisol,

801
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,240
too much epinephrine for too long.

802
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,690
But you hear about those a lot.

803
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,790
You hear about Cushing syndrome,

804
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,310
you hear about abdominal fat accumulation.

805
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,830
You hear about sleep disturbances.

806
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,790
I want to arm you with the tools first

807
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,620
and then we can talk about the dark side,

808
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,530
and all the things that hopefully

809
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,210
you'll be able to avoid entirely,

810
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,440
or that you can get yourself out of

811
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
once you have the tools in hand.

812
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,340
Let's say somebody tells you
something very troubling,

813
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,570
or you look at your phone
and you see a text message

814
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,253
that's really upsetting to you.

815
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,940
That will cause an immediate increase in

816
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,320
epinephrine adrenaline
in your brain and body.

817
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,300
And chances are it's going to increase

818
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,900
your levels of cortisol as well.

819
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,520
Let's say you get into an
ice bath or a cold shower,

820
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,620
even if you love the cold,

821
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,200
or if you hate the cold,

822
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,010
that will cause an equivalent increase

823
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,330
in epinephrine and cortisol.

824
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,590
We don't know the exact levels

825
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,700
but it's probably about the same.

826
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,870
Let's say you go out for high
intensity interval training,

827
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,830
you decide you're going
to run some sprints,

828
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,250
you do some repeats,

829
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,410
or you're going to do some
weightlifting in the gym

830
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,680
and you love lifting weights in the gym.

831
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,410
Maybe you like the power lifting thing,

832
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,920
or you decide that you
want to do some hot yoga,

833
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,603
or some thing that you
really enjoy, or you hate,

834
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,890
you're going to increase your

835
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,640
epinephrine and cortisol levels.

836
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,483
There's simply no way around this.

837
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,850
Let's say you decide to sit down

838
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,900
and you're going to do
some deep breathing.

839
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,760
We all hear about the
benefits of deep breathing.

840
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,970
So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

841
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,810
You're going to get big increases

842
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,920
in epinephrine and cortisol.

843
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,540
The data from multiple
studies support this.

844
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,890
All of those are stressors in air quotes.

845
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,380
Now there is a way that
you can cognitively reframe

846
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,213
what those are.

847
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:15,720
You can tell yourself
I love high intensity

848
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,220
interval training, or
I love weight training.

849
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,067
I personally love exercise.

850
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,650
I'm not crazy about the cold,

851
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,870
I do some cold exposure
stuff now and again,

852
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,650
and we're going to talk a
lot about how to do that

853
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,010
in the optimal way in an upcoming episode.

854
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,220
But you know, getting into the
cold doesn't feel good to me.

855
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
I tell myself it's good for me

856
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,470
and I enjoy it at some point

857
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,570
usually when I'm getting out.

858
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,060
All of those increase
epinephrine and guess what,

859
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,240
they increase your levels
of energy and alertness.

860
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,100
So if you're somebody who struggles

861
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,730
with energy and alertness
it can be beneficial,

862
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,460
provided you get
clearance from your doctor

863
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,300
to have some sort of
protocol built into your day

864
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,330
where you deliberately increase
your levels of epinephrine

865
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,733
and your levels of cortisol.

866
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,310
And I want to put the
emphasis on deliberately.

867
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,730
So how would you do that?

868
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,139
Well, it's quite easy
to turn the shower cold

869
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:08,972
and get into that,

870
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:10,150
that will wake you up.

871
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,440
And it literally wakes you up

872
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,240
because of increases in epinephrine.

873
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,639
You can do deep breathing of the sort

874
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:19,919
where you inhale and exhale
repeatedly 25 or 30 times,

875
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,900
maybe hold your breath for a few seconds

876
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,219
on an exhale and then repeat,

877
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,329
so-called Wim Hoff, or
tummo type breathing.

878
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,570
Lots of adrenaline is
released into your system

879
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,402
when you do that.

880
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,889
You will have more energy afterwards.

881
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,749
So it's really important to understand

882
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,699
that the body doesn't distinguish

883
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:38,939
between a troubling text
message, ice, tummo breathing,

884
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,230
or high intensity interval training,

885
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,913
or any other kind of
exercise, it's all stress.

886
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,409
Cognitively reframing
that and telling yourself

887
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,789
I like this, I enjoy it.

888
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,090
Is not going to change
the way that that molecule

889
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,179
impacts your body and brain.

890
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,749
I sort of chuckle because
people would love to tell you

891
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,857
that all you have to do is say,

892
00:34:57,857 --> 00:34:59,620
"Oh, this is good for me." No.

893
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,130
What it does to tell yourself
that it's good for you

894
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,120
or that you enjoy it.

895
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,390
Is that it liberates other molecules

896
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,700
like dopamine and serotonin

897
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,100
that help buffer the epinephrine response.

898
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,460
Now, the way that it does that,

899
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,890
I've talked about in previous episode,

900
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,180
but I'll just mention

901
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,120
that dopamine is the
precursor to epinephrine.

902
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,670
Epinephrine, adrenaline is
made from dopamine, okay?

903
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,540
Cortisol is made from cholesterol.

904
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,970
Epinephrine is made from dopamine.

905
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,450
And that's why if you tell yourself

906
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,220
you're enjoying something,

907
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,140
and because dopamine is so subjective

908
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,160
that you can in some ways,

909
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,910
as long as you're not
completely lying to yourself,

910
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,110
you can get more epinephrine,

911
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,700
you get more mileage or more ability

912
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,370
to push through something.

913
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,050
And you can sort of reframe it,

914
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,850
but it's not really cognitive reframing.

915
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,520
The cognitive part is the trigger,

916
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,010
but it's a chemical substance

917
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,340
that's actually occurring there.

918
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,860
It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine,

919
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,460
A bigger amplitude epinephrine release,

920
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,170
and it gives you some sense of control.

921
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,560
So here's a protocol that anyone can use.

922
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,310
If you want to increase levels of energy,

923
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,550
if you suffer from low
energy during the daytime,

924
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,400
or whenever it is that
you'd like to be alert.

925
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,430
Pick a practice that you
can do fairly consistently,

926
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,700
maybe every day,

927
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,310
but maybe every third
day or every fourth day,

928
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,790
maybe it's an ice bath or a cold bath.

929
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,290
Maybe it's a cold shower.

930
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,030
Maybe it's the cyclic inhale exhale,

931
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,410
breathing protocol I described,

932
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,750
if that wasn't clear and
people always ask for a demo,

933
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,470
I'm not going to do the
whole thing right now,

934
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,430
but I'm willing to do
a few rounds of this,

935
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,830
or a few cycles I should say.

936
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,773
So it's inhale.

937
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,950
I would do that more deeply, more like.

938
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,920
You do that 25, 30 times repeatedly

939
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,510
you will start to feel warm.

940
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,860
People in the yoga community,

941
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,000
they say you're generating heat.

942
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,450
You're not generating
heat, releasing adrenaline.

943
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,940
Inhale and exhale, inhale
exhale 25 or 30 times,

944
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,640
you will feel agitated and stressed.

945
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,300
That's because you're releasing
adrenaline in your body

946
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,460
and that's because you're releasing

947
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,433
norepinephrine in your brain,

948
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,840
and you'll be more alert.

949
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,270
Then you can follow that
25 or 30 breath cycles

950
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,623
with an exhale hold,

951
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,870
and hold your breath for 15 to 30 seconds.

952
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,900
Always, always, always
do this on dry land.

953
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,930
Never while driving,
operating heavy machinery,

954
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,030
all the standard safety protocols.

955
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,510
Never near water please,

956
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,160
people have passed out and died doing this

957
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,720
with breath holds in water.

958
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,710
There are several deaths
associated with it,

959
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,080
on land it's probably safer,
clear with your doctor,

960
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,287
but 25, 30 breaths exhale hold,

961
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:36,800
25, 30 breasts again exhale hold,

962
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,020
25 30 breasts again exhale hold.

963
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,670
And then if you like you
can do an inhale and hold

964
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,343
if that's within your margins of safety.

965
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,990
So if all these protocols,

966
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,770
all these activities are just equivalent,

967
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,360
they're just stress.

968
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,040
Then how do we make them good for us?

969
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,960
How do we actually benefit from them?

970
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,010
Now, of course the cold itself

971
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,040
can have some health promoting effects.

972
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,340
It can increase brown fat
thermogenesis and metabolism,

973
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,610
high intensity interval training,

974
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,610
or other forms of exercise

975
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,210
of course has cardiovascular effects

976
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,690
that can be good for us

977
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,370
as does weight training, et cetera.

978
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,120
But what we're talking about here

979
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,620
are ways to increase energy
and to teach our brain and body

980
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,120
to teach ourselves how to
regulate the stress response.

981
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,500
So in addition to the benefits
of the actual practices

982
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,970
what we're talking about
is building a system

983
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,310
so that when you experience

984
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,750
increases in epinephrine and
cortisol from life events

985
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,540
you're able to better buffer those.

986
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,360
And we are also talking about

987
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,170
ways that you can increase energy overall.

988
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,130
'Cause that's what today's
episode is all about,

989
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,150
energy and the immune system.

990
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,740
And indeed, we will talk about

991
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,120
how you can actually
leverage specific protocols

992
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,900
to increase your immune system on demand.

993
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,870
There's great scientific data

994
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,380
to support that one can do that.

995
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,670
So there's a biological
mechanism that's very important

996
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,220
if you want to do those things,

997
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,000
increase energy and your
immune system on demand.

998
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,690
Learn to buffer stress
on demand in real time.

999
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,210
And it means taking these protocols,

1000
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,010
these practices whether
or not it's cold water,

1001
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,330
or ice bath, or exercise, or any of those

1002
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,610
and making one small but
very powerful adjustment

1003
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,060
in how you perform them.

1004
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,800
But in order to make that adjustment,

1005
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,720
I can't just tell you the adjustment.

1006
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,210
I have to tell you the mechanism

1007
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,760
so that you know if you're
doing it correctly or not.

1008
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,060
This is really a case where

1009
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,820
if you can understand a
little bit of mechanism,

1010
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,820
you will be far better off
than just adopting protocols.

1011
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:46,180
So if you take away nothing
else from this episode

1012
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,530
except what I'm about to tell you

1013
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,050
please take away the
information I'm about to tell

1014
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,890
Cortisol as I mentioned is
released from the adrenals

1015
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,710
and it can bind to receptors.

1016
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:01,090
It can have action, both in
the body and in the brain.

1017
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,660
In fact, it can bind to the so-called

1018
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,730
threat detection center in the brain,

1019
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,980
or one of them which is the amygdala,

1020
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,380
also called the fear center.

1021
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,940
It can do that because cortisol

1022
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,730
can cross the blood brain barrier.

1023
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,830
It can be released in the body and cross

1024
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,140
this biological barrier.

1025
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,550
It's like a fence that keeps
things out of the brain

1026
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,723
but cortisol has passing
rights, it can go through.

1027
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,860
Epinephrine cannot,

1028
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,670
epinephrine is polarized,

1029
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,680
the shape of it is such that

1030
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,530
it can't make it through
the blood brain barrier.

1031
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,130
That's one of the reasons
why it's released both

1032
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,940
from the adrenals in your body

1033
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,040
and released from this brainstem area,

1034
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,773
the locus coeruleus in your brain.

1035
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,520
That's a powerful thing,
because what it means is that

1036
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,880
the body can enter states
of readiness and alertness

1037
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,970
while the mind remains calm.

1038
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,850
That is biologically possible,

1039
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,893
it's not just a psychological trick.

1040
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,120
And there are ways that one can do that.

1041
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,560
So I'm presuming at this point

1042
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,080
that you're getting your morning light

1043
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,440
to time your cortisol increase.

1044
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,020
I'm presuming that you want more energy

1045
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,530
or that you want to
increase your immune system,

1046
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,880
its function and its ability

1047
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,860
to combat infections of various kinds.

1048
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,550
And what I'm suggesting is that

1049
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:23,550
you pick from the pallet of
exercises that are out there,

1050
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,010
or tools that are out there
to increase epinephrine.

1051
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,930
There are a lot of ways to do that.

1052
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,200
You can do that as I
mentioned through cold water,

1053
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,240
through exercise.

1054
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,480
You can even do that

1055
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,823
by having confrontations
with other people.

1056
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,400
At a biological level, it is identical.

1057
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,960
So if you like to go online

1058
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,020
and place the kind of comments

1059
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,210
or read the kinds of things,

1060
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,870
or look at the kinds of
things that agitate you,

1061
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,290
you can if you like look
at that as an opportunity,

1062
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm not suggesting you do that,

1063
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,830
I'd like to see people
taking care of themselves

1064
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,190
and each other in much less
destructive ways frankly.

1065
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,190
But the prerequisite here
is getting an increase

1066
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,350
in adrenaline released from the body.

1067
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,910
Now the simplest way to
describe how to do that

1068
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,670
would be in the context of cold water

1069
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,950
or a breathing protocol,

1070
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,910
because then I don't have to deal with the

1071
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,930
unknown life circumstances
that get you triggered,

1072
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,870
or I could say what gets me triggered

1073
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,110
but I'm not going to.

1074
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,700
So let's presume cold water.

1075
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,360
So let's say you decide you're
going to take a cold shower.

1076
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,220
You get into the cold shower
and if it's cold enough,

1077
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,130
that will be stressful,

1078
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,390
you will experience an
increase in epinephrine,

1079
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,590
it will increase your alertness.

1080
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,060
Now you're using this as a practice,

1081
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,420
as a tool to build you
could call it resilience,

1082
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,610
but the ability to stay calm in the mind

1083
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,780
while being stressed in the body,

1084
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,070
epinephrine is in the body.

1085
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,650
And you do that by subjectively
trying to calm yourself.

1086
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,110
Now you can do that by telling
yourself it's good for you

1087
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,270
by emphasizing your exhales.

1088
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,920
Anything that you can
do to try and stay calm

1089
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,910
despite the fact that
you are in a heightened

1090
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,540
state of alertness.

1091
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,680
You do this with exercise,

1092
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,960
you can do this with music.

1093
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,580
Pretty much anything that will give you

1094
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,470
a really heightened state of alertness

1095
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,070
offers you the opportunity to
try and stay calm in the mind.

1096
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,550
What you're trying to do
at a mechanistic level

1097
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,260
is to have adrenaline
released from the adrenals,

1098
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,160
but not have adrenaline,
epinephrine released

1099
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,580
from the brain stem to the same degree.

1100
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,160
So you're not just trying to buffer this,

1101
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,440
you're not trying to say,
"Oh, this is good for me,

1102
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,960
this is good for me, I'm
going to grind this out."

1103
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,660
You're not trying to grind it out,

1104
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,930
you're trying to move through this calmly

1105
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,490
while maintaining alertness.

1106
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,830
You're not trying to zone out necessarily,

1107
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,370
although maybe that helps.

1108
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,870
You're not trying to distract yourself,

1109
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,910
what you're trying to do is

1110
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:43,360
shift cognitively your
relationship to the somatic,

1111
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,640
to the body stress response.

1112
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,077
Now I'm sure some of you
out there are shouting,

1113
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:49,890
"Yeah, that's exactly like
whatever, whatever, whatever."

1114
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:50,723
I agree.

1115
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:53,680
This is in many ways a self-directed

1116
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,940
kind of stress inoculation,

1117
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,110
but we're not talking about
this as stress inoculation.

1118
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,870
We're talking about this as a way

1119
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,230
to increase energy and focus.

1120
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,750
And the reason is that epinephrine

1121
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,090
when released in the body

1122
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,190
has a profound effect
on the immune system.

1123
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,250
And when released in the
brain has a profound effect

1124
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,220
on the ability to learn
and remember information

1125
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,400
and to be alert.

1126
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,070
And so we're talking about
splitting the location,

1127
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,700
separating the location from which

1128
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,170
you have epinephrine, adrenaline released.

1129
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,220
Okay. So let's say you
are doing this practice

1130
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,320
simply to wake up,

1131
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,760
okay, cold shower will do that,

1132
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,023
exercise will do that.

1133
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,210
The ability to stay calm in mind

1134
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,780
while having heightened
levels of adrenaline

1135
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,890
and presumably cortisol
as well in the body.

1136
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,510
But the cortisol is going
to circulate everywhere.

1137
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,200
We'll talk a little bit about
cortisol more in a moment.

1138
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,760
You could do that through some
self soothing calming way,

1139
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,100
that's going to be highly individual.

1140
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,070
You can do it by telling
yourself you enjoy it, et cetera.

1141
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,500
But what you need to understand

1142
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,890
is that in the immediate
period following that practice

1143
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,530
your system, your entire
brain and body are different.

1144
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:10,180
Your body is actually
primed to resist infection,

1145
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,300
when you have high levels
of epinephrine in it

1146
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,840
for short periods of time.

1147
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,960
So the scientific study that explored how

1148
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,570
increasing adrenaline in the body

1149
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,730
can improve immune resistance is grounded

1150
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,000
in a well-known phenomenon

1151
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,420
that increases in stress

1152
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,340
actually protect you against infection

1153
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,090
in the short term.

1154
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,800
So I want to look at
the classic data first,

1155
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,950
describe what was done.

1156
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,140
And then I want to talk
about the more recent study

1157
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,210
which is immediately actionable.

1158
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,100
There are classic set of
studies that are really based

1159
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,560
mainly on the work of
somebody named Bruce McEwen,

1160
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,790
who was at the Rockefeller
University in New York.

1161
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,670
Bruce passed away a few years ago,

1162
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,440
but he had many decades
of incredibly impactful

1163
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,393
work under his belt when he did.

1164
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,230
The work that I'm going to talk about next

1165
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,330
has been done in humans

1166
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,780
and has been done in animals,

1167
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,600
and has really explored
how inducing stress

1168
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,730
can enhance the function
of the immune system

1169
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:09,670
in the short term.

1170
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,110
And when, I mean short term,

1171
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,440
I mean about one to four days.

1172
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,470
I'm not going to go through
all the details of the study,

1173
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,490
but essentially what they were
doing was exposing subjects

1174
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,960
to some sort of infection,

1175
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,770
either bacterial or viral infection,

1176
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,170
and inducing stress.

1177
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,410
It sounds like a double whammy, right?

1178
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,410
You'd think that maybe getting
a little electric foot shock,

1179
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,110
or cold water exposure,

1180
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,780
or something to increase
your levels of stress

1181
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,810
and adrenaline would just make

1182
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:39,450
the effects of the infection worse,

1183
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,100
but no, quite the opposite.

1184
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,070
Brief bouts of stress,

1185
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,680
which now you should be thinking about

1186
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,260
in terms of cortisol
and epinephrine release

1187
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,923
we're actually able to increase
immune system function.

1188
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,170
Now that shouldn't surprise you

1189
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,540
if you understand a little bit

1190
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,770
about how epinephrine works
in the body and in the brain.

1191
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,290
It essentially is the signal

1192
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,870
by which the nervous system
can inform immune organs,

1193
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,740
things like the spleen and other organs

1194
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,930
that make killer cells of various kinds,

1195
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,670
B cells and T cells,

1196
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,530
to go in combat infections,

1197
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,360
bacteria, and viruses.

1198
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,050
How else would your immune system know

1199
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,420
that there was an infection?

1200
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,080
Your immune system can
recognize foreign invaders

1201
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,330
but the nervous system
provides the signal,

1202
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,450
the sort of alarm signal that
liberates the killer cells,

1203
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,100
that tells them there's a problem

1204
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,150
and to go seek out the
problem so to speak.

1205
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,810
So the duration here is really important

1206
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,820
because if stress stayed
too high for too long,

1207
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,820
then yes indeed stress can
hinder the immune response.

1208
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,360
But for a period of
about one to four days,

1209
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,140
it actually can protect you

1210
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,320
by way of increasing the immune response.

1211
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,010
Now, I can say with certainty

1212
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,440
that that effect is
governed by epinephrine,

1213
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,830
adrenaline released from the adrenals

1214
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,290
and not from the brain,

1215
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,430
because they actually explored

1216
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,270
whether or not the effect exists

1217
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,800
in the presence of what's
called an adrenalectomy,

1218
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,300
or removing the adrenals.

1219
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,880
So I should just say, without the adrenals

1220
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,810
you don't get the effect.

1221
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:15,830
So we know that that effect

1222
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,770
comes from adrenaline in the body.

1223
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:18,840
What does that mean for you?

1224
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,090
That means if you want to increase

1225
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,890
your immune system in the short term

1226
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:27,110
you want to increase your
epinephrine in the short-term.

1227
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,350
That's why short bouts
of very intense exercise

1228
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,460
probably no more than an hour per day,

1229
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,930
provided you're doing
everything else right,

1230
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,140
sleeping and nutrition, et cetera,

1231
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,850
maybe even shorter bouts
of intense exercise

1232
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,210
or exposure to cold water,

1233
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,720
or that cyclical breathing
that I talked about before,

1234
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,770
because they increase epinephrine

1235
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,160
they will bolster the immune system.

1236
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,010
And we all hear these reports
every once in a while,

1237
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,420
it seems to be the thing that

1238
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,280
every once in a while there'll
be an article about how

1239
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,030
coffee can improve your immune system,

1240
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,863
or something like that.

1241
00:48:57,863 --> 00:49:00,060
Indeed caffeine can increase epinephrine

1242
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,090
and dopamine to some extent,

1243
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,870
but most people are
drinking it chronically.

1244
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,130
So its effects are probably
due to increases in epinephrine

1245
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,550
and probably whether or
not something like coffee

1246
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,350
or other forms of caffeine can improve

1247
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,850
or degrade your immune system

1248
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,560
will probably depend on whether or not

1249
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,630
you're using it in a way

1250
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,950
that it increases your
adrenaline as a spike,

1251
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,400
that happens rarely,

1252
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,000
you know, once every two or three months,

1253
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,430
let's say you have an infection coming on,

1254
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,050
yes, indeed.

1255
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,230
What these data probably mean

1256
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,980
is that drinking some hot caffeinated tea

1257
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,480
or some hot coffee even

1258
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,540
provided you don't get dehydrated from it

1259
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,160
because you're also drinking some water

1260
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,380
can probably improve your
immune system function,

1261
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,980
by way of increasing adrenaline release.

1262
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,840
But so can the breathing,
so can cold exposure,

1263
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,980
so can exercise.

1264
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,680
The mechanism here is what's key,

1265
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,560
and I keep saying that

1266
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,900
because what it means is that

1267
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,630
you don't actually have to
know the specific protocol.

1268
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,780
I'm not trying to say, do
this particular protocol.

1269
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,170
You have to figure out,

1270
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,590
and it should be easy to figure out

1271
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,220
what short term adrenaline
increasing behavior

1272
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,950
you're willing to do on a
regular basis every day,

1273
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,380
or two or three times a week.

1274
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,440
Now you could say, well, I'm not sick.

1275
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,450
Should I be doing these things often?

1276
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,610
I would say, two or three
times a week at a minimum

1277
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,190
if your goal is to keep
your immune system tuned up

1278
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,000
and you are in the presence of a lot of

1279
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,010
children for instance,

1280
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:25,130
which carry a lot of bugs,

1281
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,990
because their immune
system isn't developed,

1282
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,210
or you work in a healthcare setting,

1283
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,760
or you're simply somebody
who's prone to get sick.

1284
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,620
I can just say anecdotally,

1285
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,730
I guess someone now calls this anecdata

1286
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,080
which I don't like that phrase,

1287
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,520
because it's sort of...

1288
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,190
I don't want anecdotal data to ever be

1289
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,633
misunderstood as anything
but anecdotal data.

1290
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,410
Anecdotally, I can say that I've had

1291
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:52,580
instances where I've felt
a throat tickle coming on

1292
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,050
or some sinus infection,

1293
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,242
I will do the cyclic breathing
that I described before.

1294
00:50:57,242 --> 00:50:58,777
25, 30 breasts exhale hold,

1295
00:50:58,777 --> 00:51:01,507
25 30 breasts exhale hold,
25, 30 breaths exhale hold,

1296
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:02,900
and then big inhale hold.

1297
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,690
And most times I didn't
get full blown sick,

1298
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,750
but I also take other
precautionary measures

1299
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,990
to get sleep, et cetera.

1300
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,120
So whether or not it was causal,

1301
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,620
or whether or not it's just
correlated I don't know.

1302
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,470
However, there's a human study

1303
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:18,820
that I definitely want
to point out to you,

1304
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,250
because it was published more recently

1305
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,190
than the McEwen work.

1306
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,580
It was published in the Proceedings

1307
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,420
of the National Academy
of Sciences for the USA,

1308
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,410
because there are Proceedings

1309
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:28,620
of the National Academy of Sciences

1310
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,470
for many other countries as well.

1311
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,457
The title of the paper is

1312
00:51:31,457 --> 00:51:34,290
"Voluntary activation of the
sympathetic nervous system."

1313
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,730
That's the system that causes
fight or flight AKA stress,

1314
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,577
and causes release of adrenaline.

1315
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:43,680
"And attenuation of the innate
immune response in humans."

1316
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,240
This is Kox et al. PNAS,

1317
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,890
Proceedings to the National
Academy of sciences, 2014.

1318
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,940
And they incorporate the
ever famous Wim Hof breathing

1319
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,260
Wim Hof breathing is much
like the breathing protocol

1320
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,200
that I've described several
times now in this podcast.

1321
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,260
It's also called tummo breathing.

1322
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,270
Other people from other
cultures and communities

1323
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,330
have called it other things.

1324
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,480
The naming really isn't important.

1325
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,070
Although I do think Wim is a pioneer

1326
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,820
in trying to bring these practices

1327
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,580
to the general public more broadly

1328
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,513
and was involved in this study.

1329
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,540
The study was done in the Netherlands.

1330
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,810
It was communicated by
Dr. Tamas Horvath at Yale,

1331
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,240
I mentioned all that.

1332
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,750
Horvath is a terrific scientist,

1333
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,400
I'm familiar with his
work over many years.

1334
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,450
Here's what they did.

1335
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,590
They injected people with E. coli

1336
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,270
and they had groups that either

1337
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:42,320
did the sorts of breathing
I've been describing

1338
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,040
that increase adrenaline release.

1339
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,030
Although I should say,

1340
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,600
I don't think you need that breathing

1341
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,660
to get adrenaline release.

1342
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,990
You could do it with cold exposure,

1343
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,860
you could do it with other things,

1344
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,810
high intensity interval training as well.

1345
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,030
And what they found was that

1346
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,180
the response to the E.
coli was quite different

1347
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,730
in the people that had a protocol,

1348
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,630
in this case breathing
to increase adrenaline.

1349
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,580
So this is a remarkable study

1350
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,080
because what they found was
that the fever, the vomiting,

1351
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,970
the all the negative effects of E. coli,

1352
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:18,340
many of them and some cases all of them

1353
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,670
were greatly attenuated

1354
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,800
by way of engaging the adrenaline system.

1355
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,080
In this case using breathing.

1356
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,650
They looked at inflammatory cytokines,

1357
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,740
things like IL-6,

1358
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,440
which I've mentioned many
times on this podcast.

1359
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,860
This are classic inflammatory
cytokine were reduced.

1360
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,770
Things like IL-10

1361
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,370
which are anti-inflammatory
were increased.

1362
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,320
There were some inflammatory
cytokines that were increased.

1363
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,363
What's the point here?

1364
00:53:42,363 --> 00:53:45,190
The point is you can
control your immune system,

1365
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,110
by finding a way that you
can increase adrenaline.

1366
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,620
And this runs counter
to what we always hear,

1367
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,780
which is don't get too
stressed or you will get sick.

1368
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,560
Learn to control adrenaline,
turn it on and turn it off.

1369
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,080
Learn to control cortisol,

1370
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,710
turn it on with light in the morning,

1371
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,790
try and turn it off

1372
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,690
and then when it spikes
because of life events

1373
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:06,883
learn to turn it off.

1374
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,880
Learning to turn on and off
adrenaline, AKA epinephrine,

1375
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,610
and learning to turn on and off cortisol

1376
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:20,110
affords you the ability to
turn on energy and focus

1377
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,333
in your immune system.

1378
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,620
That's the most important
point from today's podcast

1379
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,620
and understanding that it doesn't matter

1380
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,020
what protocol you use.

1381
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,160
Maybe it's a cup of coffee

1382
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,990
and running up a hill five or six times,

1383
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,690
that will improve your
immune system function

1384
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,250
if you get adrenaline in your system.

1385
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,340
You can use an ice bath,

1386
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,330
you can use a cold bath,

1387
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,480
it really doesn't matter.

1388
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,490
You get into an argument,

1389
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,870
but I'm not suggesting you do that,

1390
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,510
it really doesn't matter.

1391
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,910
What's important is that
you're able to then shut off

1392
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,020
that response.

1393
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,740
And there are ways to do
that we will talk about,

1394
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,680
but I want to talk about
some of the other benefits

1395
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,680
of epinephrine and cortisol

1396
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,560
that occur because of
their actions on the brain.

1397
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,140
Because these are many
and they are powerful,

1398
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,610
and they relate to energy,
but also the ability to learn.

1399
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,150
If I haven't already convinced you

1400
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,810
that seeing light early in the day

1401
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,290
is good for timing your cortisol.

1402
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,550
I should also mention that another hormone

1403
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,310
that I discussed last episode
which is thyroid hormone

1404
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,610
and is critical for setting
your level of metabolism

1405
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:23,610
is controlled in part by
these circadian mechanisms

1406
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,253
and cortisol itself.

1407
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,400
The short takeaway on this

1408
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,390
is that if you get your cortisol
release early in the day

1409
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,510
it will increase your
energy throughout the day,

1410
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,630
it will also time your
thyroid release properly.

1411
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,810
So there's yet another reason

1412
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,540
why you would want to
get that light exposure

1413
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,373
early in the day.

1414
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:48,020
For me that's a non-negotiable practice.

1415
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,880
If I'm on a plane, I'll try
and get it any way I can.

1416
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,740
I'm not shining
flashlights in my eyes yet,

1417
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,540
but I really try hard to
get that light exposure

1418
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:01,460
from sunlight early in
the day without fail.

1419
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,760
And the thyroid increase
has to do with the fact that

1420
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,320
your circadian clock itself
is regulated by cortisol

1421
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,640
and the circadian clock times the release

1422
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,970
of thyroid hormone.

1423
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,770
I don't want to go too
far off in that direction,

1424
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,763
but there are a number of studies,

1425
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,770
Kalsbeek et al.

1426
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,523
Kalsbeek et al. 2012.

1427
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,330
If you want to look it up
on PubMed is a great one,

1428
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,950
that describes how cortisol secretion

1429
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,260
begins to rise during sleep

1430
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,610
and peaks shortly after
waking or immediately before.

1431
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:41,610
And that times a set of
neurons in the circadian clock

1432
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,170
that then trigger the release of the

1433
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,940
releasing and stimulating
hormones for thyroid.

1434
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,770
So a really important mechanism,

1435
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:53,230
and thyroid will also tend
to correlate with energy

1436
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:54,480
but mostly metabolism.

1437
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,470
Very important to have thyroid in check.

1438
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:58,420
Now let's talk about
epinephrine and cortisol,

1439
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,823
and learning and memory.

1440
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,760
Everyone has a story
about being so stressed

1441
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,780
they couldn't remember something.

1442
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,880
You know, sit down to an exam.

1443
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,460
I actually had this happen
once sat down to an exam

1444
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,380
and just blanked, just blanked.

1445
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,000
It only happened once, I
don't know what happened.

1446
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,370
I don't think it was sleep deprivation

1447
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,490
but I just completely blanked.

1448
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,040
And it was very hard for me

1449
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,070
to pull myself out of that ditch.

1450
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:25,240
I did manage to do it, but
it was a scary experience.

1451
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,350
So I think most people think about stress

1452
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:29,370
and an inability to perform.

1453
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:34,000
However, most of the time
increases in epinephrine

1454
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,020
provided they are not through the roof

1455
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,120
lead to improved performance.

1456
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,570
Now this has been shown over
and over again on memory tests,

1457
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:47,570
on learning new information,
on physical performance.

1458
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,280
That when blood levels
of epinephrine are low

1459
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,943
you don't perform very well.

1460
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,750
When blood levels of
epinephrine are very high

1461
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,273
up to about 1500 to 1700 pg/mL.

1462
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,640
If anyone's out there, who's
actually measuring this stuff

1463
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,640
but I doubt you are,

1464
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,620
performance goes way up.

1465
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,220
Performance gets better when you are alert

1466
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,120
and when you're a little bit stressed.

1467
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,330
Absolutely shown again,
and again, and again.

1468
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,750
If you get too stressed,
it's the mental side,

1469
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,040
it's the epinephrine in the
brain that causes people

1470
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,620
to either focus on their
somatic response too much.

1471
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,780
Like they feel like they're sweating,

1472
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,620
and they're focused on
their bodily response,

1473
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,370
they're not focused on what
it is they're trying to do,

1474
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,520
or say, or perform, et cetera, or learn.

1475
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,170
But epinephrine is a nootropic,

1476
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,530
it is a smart drug that
we all make internally,

1477
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:42,080
and cortisol is as well.

1478
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,540
Now here's the twist

1479
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,290
that does not mean that
you want epinephrine

1480
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,683
high during the exam necessarily.

1481
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,610
Memory and learning and
performance are actually favored,

1482
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,220
they are enhanced by epinephrine increases

1483
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,830
immediately after learning.

1484
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,020
And that's something
that's rarely discussed,

1485
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,810
the timing is vital.

1486
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:10,270
So if you learn some information,

1487
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,810
you have a conversation

1488
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:15,090
you're trying to learn a new
language, a new motor skill.

1489
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:18,070
Whatever it is that
you're trying to learn,

1490
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:22,530
the increase in epinephrine
that occurs just afterward

1491
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:25,550
is what's going to
consolidate the information.

1492
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,750
It's going to ensure
that the proper circuits

1493
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,970
and mechanisms in the
brain for neuroplasticity

1494
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,880
are engaged during sleep later that night

1495
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,600
or the next night which is
when the real rewiring occurs.

1496
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,410
And You might say, "That's
crazy, why would that happen?"

1497
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,080
Well, we have to remember,

1498
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,990
none of these mechanisms evolved

1499
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,300
for us to do what we want and
learn what we want necessarily

1500
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,980
although they will allow us to do that.

1501
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,180
We've experienced this before,

1502
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:53,120
we might have gotten up,
gone outside get in our car,

1503
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,020
drive to work or to somebody's house

1504
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,540
you're not thinking about much at all,

1505
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,200
and then all of a sudden you
see an accident on the road.

1506
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,570
Your alertness is primed

1507
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,750
if it happens to be a
particularly gory accident,

1508
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,120
there's going to be a lot of
sensory information there.

1509
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,800
All of a sudden the
adrenaline, epinephrine

1510
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,230
is released into your brain and body.

1511
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,160
Guess what?

1512
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,810
Not only will you not forget that event,

1513
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,660
but you will remember everything
that led up to that event

1514
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,020
which has an adaptive function,

1515
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,820
because your brain and body's

1516
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,330
primary concern is safety, right?

1517
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,350
This is the neuro-biological explanation

1518
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:30,880
for Maslow's hierarchy
of needs is safety first.

1519
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,930
And so you have heightened
awareness and alertness

1520
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,540
for everything that preceded

1521
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:39,060
that spike in adrenaline and cortisol.

1522
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,270
So the way to think about this is

1523
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,170
if you need to learn something better,

1524
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,560
if you're taking Adderall,

1525
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,560
or you're taking a lot
of coffee beforehand

1526
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,520
you're actually driving the
process in the wrong direction.

1527
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,050
You're increasing epinephrine
for learning sure,

1528
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,020
but past a certain point

1529
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,890
you're actually degrading
learning and performance.

1530
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,530
The time to do that is toward the end

1531
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,460
or immediately after the learning,

1532
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,780
because this mechanism
is not simply devoted to

1533
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,970
negative events like a
car crash or a trauma,

1534
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,510
it works to make sure that the hippocampus

1535
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,190
that encodes memories

1536
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,450
as part of the memory and
coding mechanisms is primed.

1537
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,660
That it's told what you just
experienced is important,

1538
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,550
you're going to need
that information later.

1539
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,350
And so I've talked many times before about

1540
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,840
using non sleep deep rest NSDR,

1541
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,440
or ensuring good night's
sleep after learning.

1542
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,260
But what we're also talking about

1543
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,950
is as the learning event tapers
off, as you're exiting that,

1544
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:39,820
to make sure that your epinephrine levels

1545
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,810
are not tapering off as well.

1546
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:45,230
And this may be one of the
reasons why the 90 minute cycle,

1547
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,610
the so-called ultradian
cycle for learning works,

1548
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,570
because it takes a few minutes

1549
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,460
to get into rhythm of learning.

1550
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,810
You can maintain that
alertness for about 90 minutes,

1551
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,610
it's no coincidence that
these podcasts are typically

1552
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:58,890
about 90 minutes long.

1553
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,410
And as you exit that 90 minutes

1554
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,120
you're going to start to feel fatigued.

1555
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,500
You're not going to be able to continue

1556
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,960
to secrete epinephrine at the same level.

1557
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,220
So I'm not telling you that
at the end of this podcast

1558
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,100
you should give yourself a foot shock,

1559
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,810
or that you should jump into an ice bath.

1560
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,643
Although I will say,

1561
01:02:15,643 --> 01:02:17,460
if you were to increase your epinephrine

1562
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,690
at the end of this episode

1563
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,060
by breathing or by way of cold shower,

1564
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,180
I'm willing to bet based on
numerous published studies

1565
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,210
that the memory for the
information would be enhanced.

1566
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,900
Because of this retroactive effect

1567
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,380
of epinephrine and cortisol.

1568
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,070
Put simply you can remember things better

1569
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,060
if you increase your alertness,

1570
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,630
AKA your level of epinephrine
and cortisol after,

1571
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,090
immediately after something
that you want to learn.

1572
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:48,860
So I'm reminded by people here
at the Huberman Lab Podcast

1573
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:52,490
that the optimal strategy
therefore would be

1574
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,690
a 90 minute session of focus or learning

1575
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:00,690
then immediately after cold
shower or tummo type breathing,

1576
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,970
or ice bath or something of that sort,

1577
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,070
maybe a hard run,

1578
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,160
or hit training if you can't
get access to the other things.

1579
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,270
And then shower up and
do a non sleep deep rest,

1580
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,390
and then get a good night's sleep.

1581
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,410
Those would be the optimal tools

1582
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:18,730
and the organization of
tools for enhanced learning.

1583
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,400
And of course you could use caffeine

1584
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,680
to prime the whole process
by drinking the caffeine

1585
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,440
towards the tail of the learning episode,

1586
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,930
which is counter-intuitive at least to me.

1587
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,610
I should mention since
many of you use caffeine

1588
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,443
and I use caffeine.

1589
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:32,460
I do drink coffee,

1590
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,600
I love mushroom coffee.

1591
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,600
I love mate.

1592
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,763
I drink caffeine and various forms.

1593
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,330
There was a study that came out recently

1594
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:44,350
that is relevant to our
discussion about energy

1595
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,180
and alertness, and learning.

1596
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:51,450
And the study came out
just recently March 2021,

1597
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,470
it's Maglhaes et al.

1598
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:54,553
So MAGALHAES.

1599
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,450
And it was published
in molecular psychiatry

1600
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,610
which is a fine journal,
a peer review journal.

1601
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,667
And the title pretty much gives it away,

1602
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:09,160
"Habitual coffee drinkers
display a distinct pattern

1603
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,850
of brain functional conductivity."

1604
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:15,050
Chronically drinking coffee
changes brain conductivity.

1605
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:16,860
And it does it in a number of ways

1606
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,410
but the key takeaways from this study,

1607
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:22,860
as it relates to sort
of what the circuits do

1608
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,250
as opposed to me just listing
off a bunch of brain circuits,

1609
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:28,270
which is kind of meaningless
in this conversation

1610
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:33,270
is that people who drank
coffee habitually every day

1611
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,360
had changes in their brain circuitry,

1612
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:40,107
such that there was a shift
or a bias toward anxiety

1613
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,710
even when they don't ingest caffeine.

1614
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:44,760
So a lot of times we think,

1615
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,380
Oh caffeine increases
your levels of anxiety.

1616
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,620
And indeed it appears it does
if you use it chronically,

1617
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,880
but not just to caffeine,

1618
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,150
it doesn't just raise
your baseline of anxiety

1619
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,930
because of what circulating
in your bloodstream.

1620
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,620
It actually increases connectivity

1621
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,850
between the brain areas
that relate to anxiety.

1622
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,400
Now that could be a good
thing or a bad thing

1623
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,580
depending on how you look at it.

1624
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:10,240
For people that have are
prone to chronic panic attacks

1625
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,310
or anxiety attacks that's
not going to be good.

1626
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,900
Some people might use
caffeine in healthy ways.

1627
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,650
I believe I do in order to

1628
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,400
just increase overall levels of alertness.

1629
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,750
Although now not only am
I going to start delaying

1630
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,600
my caffeine intake till
two hours after I wake up

1631
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,150
for reasons I've talked
about in previous episodes,

1632
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,240
but I'm also going to start drinking it

1633
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,640
later in learning and focus sessions

1634
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,510
as a way to enhance plasticity

1635
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,620
around those learning and
focus sessions, not before.

1636
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,520
So interesting study, it's free online.

1637
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,210
You can access the full paper online,

1638
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,980
we will put a link as well.

1639
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,020
I want to mention this
issue of nootropics,

1640
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,100
so-called smart drugs.

1641
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,380
Which is not a topic
that I particularly enjoy

1642
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,500
because I don't like the name.

1643
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,940
I don't like the idea of a nootropic,

1644
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,290
because what is a smart drug?

1645
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,890
Well, there's different kinds of smart,

1646
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:00,030
there's creativity,
there's task switching,

1647
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,890
their strategy building,
their strategy implementation.

1648
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,630
And most of the nootropics
that are out there

1649
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,470
just cocktails of a
bunch of different things

1650
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,590
that aren't tailored to
the individual at all.

1651
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,380
They all seem to have some caffeine,

1652
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,640
or some culinary trick
stimulation, et cetera.

1653
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,120
But there's an important way to frame this

1654
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,990
in light of today's conversation.

1655
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,910
Nootropics generally
fall into two categories,

1656
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:24,890
one category are nootropics
that increase blood glucose.

1657
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,967
So these are compounds that people take

1658
01:06:26,967 --> 01:06:27,970
they increased blood glucose

1659
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:29,530
and increasing in blood glucose

1660
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:32,100
will improve performance,

1661
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,650
and can enhance learning
in some situations.

1662
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,060
I'm not suggesting
people take these things,

1663
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,040
but here's just a list of a few of those.

1664
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,030
Some of them are legal,

1665
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,270
some of them are gray market,

1666
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,523
some of them are illegal.

1667
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,423
piracetam, oxiracetam,

1668
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,610
aniracetam, all the Tams, okay.

1669
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,080
Elevate blood glucose
that's how they work.

1670
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,090
The neural effects that you
hear are secondary or tertiary

1671
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:57,320
to the fact that they just
increased blood glucose.

1672
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,550
We know that because if you
block the blood glucose effect

1673
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,700
you block the nootropic effect, okay.

1674
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,700
Others include, and definitely
don't take these please,

1675
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,760
amphetamine, cocaine.

1676
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,430
Those will increase
learning in the short term

1677
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,130
in particular dosages,

1678
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,030
but because they increase blood glucose.

1679
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:18,440
And then of course, things
like painful stimuli

1680
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,190
or stress will improve learning

1681
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,900
by way of increasing blood glucose.

1682
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,450
Now stress and epinephrine
that's associated with it

1683
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,360
not only improve performance
during the learning about,

1684
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,500
but as I mentioned before

1685
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,710
having epinephrine come up afterward

1686
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:36,760
will increase the retention
of that information

1687
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,090
in the longterm.

1688
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,240
And then of course,
there's a whole category of

1689
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,270
nootropics that don't
impact blood glucose,

1690
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:47,570
that work by increasing the
cholinergic system activity.

1691
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:50,260
And these are things
like choline, lecithin,

1692
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,970
Physostigmine, it's a prescription drug,

1693
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,120
phosphodiesterase.

1694
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,530
So there're ways to increase energy

1695
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,040
that don't require
increase in blood glucose,

1696
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,500
and this is a vitally important.

1697
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,840
The reason we're talking
about epinephrine and cortisol

1698
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,200
for increasing energy and
immune system function

1699
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,240
is because they are largely
independent of blood glucose.

1700
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,430
Of course, they interact with that system,

1701
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:17,069
but we heard so much growing
up you need to eat for energy,

1702
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:19,679
but the energy that
we're talking about today

1703
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,180
is actually a much more powerful one

1704
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,500
than the one that you derive from food,

1705
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,080
We could call it neural energy.

1706
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,319
It's neurotransmitters
that create alertness,

1707
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,589
and focus, and the willingness
and the ability to move.

1708
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:33,170
And the willingness and
ability for immune system

1709
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,590
to move in response to intruders.

1710
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,710
So I think we all too often
think about food as energy

1711
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,660
which is great because it is,

1712
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,930
but there are other sources
of energy that are neural

1713
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,899
and they relate to these hormone systems,

1714
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:49,049
cortisol and epinephrine.

1715
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,750
And that's why we're focused on today.

1716
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,100
So up until now we've been talking about

1717
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,090
increasing energy and
increasing the immune system

1718
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,670
by way of cortisol and epinephrine,

1719
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,540
but I'd be totally
remiss if I didn't cover

1720
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:07,390
how cortisol and epinephrine
if chronically elevated,

1721
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,140
or if elevated too high

1722
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,670
can have a lot of detrimental effects.

1723
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,620
These are the things
we normally hear about.

1724
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,050
I'm going to describe some of those things

1725
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:20,790
but I'm also going to talk
about ways to ameliorate them.

1726
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:23,750
Ways that you can adjust
the cortisol levels,

1727
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,750
even if you're stressed.

1728
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,630
Ways that you can adjust
epinephrine levels

1729
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,920
even if you're stressed

1730
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,313
so that they have less
of a negative impact.

1731
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:33,599
I don't have to list off all the ways

1732
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,560
that stress is terrible and
chronic stress is terrible

1733
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,840
I think you know.

1734
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,609
Insomnia, your immune system
over time will get battered

1735
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:44,679
and you won't be able to fight
infection off as well, right?

1736
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,730
You don't want to be
stressed for too long.

1737
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,760
You can start laying down the sort of

1738
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,833
classic pattern of
cortisol induced body fat.

1739
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,670
In fact, there's a whole
literature related to comfort foods

1740
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:00,780
and why we want to consume comfort foods

1741
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,260
under conditions of chronic stress.

1742
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:04,890
And it's quite interesting actually,

1743
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,840
because it reveals something

1744
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,580
about the biology of chronic stress

1745
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,780
that's informative for how to prevent it,

1746
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:15,100
or to down regulate chronic
stress once it's occurred.

1747
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,630
So let's talk for a
second about comfort foods

1748
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,400
and the work that I'm going to refer to

1749
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,270
is work that was done by a
very impressive scientist

1750
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,470
by the name of Mary Dallman.

1751
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,840
Her work goes back decades.

1752
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,530
She was at University of
California San Francisco,

1753
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,870
and she asked this question

1754
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,650
that on the face of it
seems kind of obvious,

1755
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,960
but for which there was no mechanism known

1756
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,860
until Mary and her lab
personnel came along.

1757
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,693
And the question was,

1758
01:10:40,693 --> 01:10:44,610
why do we seek high-fat
and or high sugar foods

1759
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,780
when we are stressed for awhile?

1760
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,480
Why would that be?

1761
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,450
And the reason is that the
so-called glucocorticoids

1762
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,940
of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid.

1763
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,180
It's caused as we've mentioned before,

1764
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,600
by releasing hormones from the brain,

1765
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,250
and ACTH from the pituitary, et cetera.

1766
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:07,010
But normally high levels
of glucocorticoid shut off

1767
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:10,550
the releasing hormones in the
brain and in the pituitary,

1768
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:13,740
they shut down in a so-called
negative feedback loop.

1769
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:17,750
So just like if testosterone
or estrogen get too high

1770
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:22,080
that's read out or that
is seen so to speak

1771
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,010
by neurons in the pituitary and brain

1772
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:27,150
and then we shut down our production of

1773
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:31,420
estrogen and testosterone.

1774
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,050
If cortisol levels get too high,

1775
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,900
if there's too much cortisol

1776
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,400
floating around in our bloodstream,

1777
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,760
there's a negative feedback loop,

1778
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,750
and the brain and pituitary
shutdown, CRH and ACTH

1779
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,730
which would otherwise
stimulate more cortisol,

1780
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,520
so cortisol levels go down.

1781
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,360
So it's a beautiful
negative feedback loop.

1782
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,090
Chronic stress however,

1783
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:53,160
stress that lasts more
than four to seven days

1784
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,720
and there's a way to think about

1785
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,848
what chronic stress really
is in an actionable way,

1786
01:11:57,848 --> 01:12:01,290
'causes changes in the feedback loop

1787
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:06,290
between the adrenals and
the brain and the pituitary.

1788
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,640
Such that now the brain and the pituitary

1789
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,360
respond to high levels of
glucocorticoids cortisol

1790
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,790
by releasing more of them.

1791
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:15,280
It becomes a positive feedback loop

1792
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,220
and that's bad

1793
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:19,830
it actually gets right down
to levels of gene regulation

1794
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:21,670
and transcription and translation.

1795
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,810
And so you really don't
want chronic stress,

1796
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:26,430
because it's a cascade of

1797
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,470
stress equals more stress
equals more stress.

1798
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,730
So this is why it's very important

1799
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:32,540
to learn to turn off the stress response.

1800
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,940
You don't want it elevated for too long.

1801
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,540
So there's one study that
Dallman and her colleagues did

1802
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:39,360
where they stimulate chronic stress

1803
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,093
by increasing corticosteroids, cortisol.

1804
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,940
And they found that subjects

1805
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,830
would increase their
consumption of sugar and fat.

1806
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,430
In fact they would even eat lard

1807
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:52,600
It's sounds disgusting,

1808
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,470
but they were willing to just
eat more fat and more sugar.

1809
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:56,760
And that led to all sorts of things

1810
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,230
like type two diabetes

1811
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:03,460
that led to dysfunction in
the adrenal output, et cetera.

1812
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,450
And so the real key is to learn

1813
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:07,620
to shut off the stress response.

1814
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,910
Because the interesting thing is,

1815
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,150
is that dominant colleagues

1816
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:14,040
and some studies that followed
up on their work found that

1817
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,710
if the system was kicked
into motion for too long,

1818
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:22,240
then there was a tremendous
shift overall towards anxiety,

1819
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,490
because it turns out that body fat itself

1820
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,760
receives neural innervation.

1821
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,500
Neurons actually talked to body fats

1822
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,190
so now you have body fat
releasing certain hormones,

1823
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,070
you've got the adrenals
releasing cortisol,

1824
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,120
and all of that is
feeding back to the brain

1825
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,210
to make you want more
sugar and fatty foods.

1826
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:43,240
So that's how the so-called
comfort foods work.

1827
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,870
And you should watch yourself

1828
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,460
next time you experience stress.

1829
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,150
If it's a short-term about of stress,

1830
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:50,880
typically it blocks hunger.

1831
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,810
If it's a longer about of stress

1832
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,490
typically it triggers hunger,

1833
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,100
in particular for these
so-called comfort foods,

1834
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,720
sugary and fatty foods.

1835
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,760
And it's kind of interesting

1836
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,500
how short-term stress can
actually block hunger.

1837
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,000
It does that by activating

1838
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
or interacting with a system
called the bombesin system.

1839
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,593
Bombesin is a peptide hormone.

1840
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,740
I think it was named after
some sort of reptiles

1841
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,140
or amphibians, excuse
me, some sort of toad.

1842
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,070
I think it was initially
sequenced from the toad

1843
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,900
before it was later discovered in humans.

1844
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:29,330
And I think the Toad's Latin
name is Bombina bombina,

1845
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:30,440
or something of that sort.

1846
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,870
And so they decided to
call this thing bombesin,

1847
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:37,430
but it reduces eating and
stress liberates bombesin

1848
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,800
and makes you want to eat less.

1849
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,190
But chronic stress causes all these

1850
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:45,130
positive feedback changes,
which are not positive.

1851
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:45,963
I'm calling them positive

1852
01:14:45,963 --> 01:14:48,520
because they amplify the
stress response over and over

1853
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,430
not because they are good for you.

1854
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,360
So short-term stress great,

1855
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,700
long-term stress really, really bad.

1856
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,360
Other bad effects of stress
that we can talk about

1857
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,970
and I won't list off
too many more of these,

1858
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:03,070
because you know so many of
them, you hear about them.

1859
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:05,290
You really want to know how
to control them I'm guessing

1860
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:08,563
is that yes indeed stress
can make you go gray.

1861
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:13,590
The rates at which people
go gray, meaning gray hair,

1862
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,280
some cases gray body hair as well

1863
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,540
depend on some genetic factors.

1864
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,300
There are a couple of
ways that we can go gray.

1865
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,420
There's actually a STEM cell,

1866
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,210
what they call niche in every follicle.

1867
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,550
So you have STEM cells in the follicle

1868
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:30,040
that can produce more and
more of the given hair cell.

1869
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,150
And they're actually peroxide groups.

1870
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:33,920
You know we hear about
bleaching hair with peroxide,

1871
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,490
at least in the 80s that was a thing,

1872
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,840
but you can use hydrogen
peroxide to bleach things,

1873
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,860
and you can produce your own
peroxide in the hair follicle,

1874
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:44,010
that will cause the hairs to go gray.

1875
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:46,870
In addition pigmentation of hair,

1876
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:48,350
just like pigmentation of skin

1877
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:51,630
is controlled by melanocytes,

1878
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:52,737
our old friends, the melanocytes.

1879
01:15:52,737 --> 01:15:54,920
And I say old friends
'cause on previous episodes

1880
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,060
I talked about why sunlight
and getting ample sunlight

1881
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,550
can increase levels of certain things

1882
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:03,280
like melanocytes stimulating hormone

1883
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,240
which reduce hunger.

1884
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,130
It can improve testosterone
and estrogen levels

1885
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,590
and all the reasons for that.

1886
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:11,780
Well, it turns out that activation

1887
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,990
of the so-called
sympathetic nervous system,

1888
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,910
which is really just another name for

1889
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:19,777
the system that liberates
adrenaline from the adrenals

1890
01:16:19,777 --> 01:16:21,290
and epinephrine in the brain

1891
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:26,830
drives depletion of
melanocytes in hair stem cells.

1892
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,640
So indeed there's a rate of aging

1893
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,950
that we will undergo
based on our genetics,

1894
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:33,130
but stress will make us go gray.

1895
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,020
And the paper that you should look to

1896
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:36,120
if you want to read more about this

1897
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,260
came out very recently.

1898
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:42,100
This is Zang et al, Z
H A N G et al. Nature.

1899
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:46,330
Fabulous journal, definitely
one of the apex journals, 2020.

1900
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:51,330
So this paper showed that
the activation of stress

1901
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:54,663
in various forms will deplete
these melanocytes stem cells.

1902
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,500
You do not have to
worry about an ice bath,

1903
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,050
or hard exercise or breathing,

1904
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,500
increasing your levels of stress

1905
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,940
to the point where it's
going to make you go gray.

1906
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,870
We're talking again about chronic stress.

1907
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,560
And if you want to
offset the stress effects

1908
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,130
on graying of hair you can do that

1909
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,060
by either having a practice

1910
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,020
that helps you regulate
stress on a consistent basis.

1911
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,190
So something like non sleep
deep breath, or meditation.

1912
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:24,280
You can get access to massages
or vacations those are great,

1913
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,350
but having a practice
to keep stress clamps

1914
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,250
so that it's not chronically elevated,

1915
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,620
that will be great as well.

1916
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:34,050
This is another case where sunlight

1917
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,770
we know stimulates melanocytes,

1918
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:39,130
not just in skin, but in hair.

1919
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,940
And so getting ample sunlight,

1920
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,300
having a practice to regulate stress

1921
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:48,110
will offset the stressed
induced grain of hairs

1922
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:53,110
by way of stress induced
depletion of melanocytes.

1923
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,750
And if melanocytes sounds a
lot like melanin you're right.

1924
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,680
That's because anything
involved with pigmentation

1925
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,750
in the brain and body
generally has "melano"

1926
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:03,960
up in the front of the word
in some way or another.

1927
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,680
So if chronic stress is so bad

1928
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,340
because of its effects on
epinephrine and cortisol

1929
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,940
being elevated for too long

1930
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,840
then the question becomes of course,

1931
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,000
well, what's chronic stress?

1932
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,670
How do I know the
difference between chronic

1933
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:18,920
and acute stress?

1934
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,470
And how do I keep chronic stress at bay?

1935
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,790
Because of all these negative effects,

1936
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,800
I didn't even list out
the number of other ones,

1937
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,840
the effects on depression,

1938
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,203
which certainly has a correlate
with elevated cortisol.

1939
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,450
Thyroid hormone.

1940
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:38,010
Low thyroid hormone is
associated with depression.

1941
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:43,010
Mistimed thyroid, once
again getting your light

1942
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:48,660
and your feeding and your
exercise and your sleep

1943
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,930
on a consistent schedule or consistent ish

1944
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:54,250
is going to be the most
powerful thing you can do

1945
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,900
in order to buffer yourself

1946
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,820
against negative effects on mental health

1947
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,240
and physical health for that matter.

1948
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,940
There are things that one can take

1949
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,350
supplements, prescription
drugs, et cetera.

1950
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,110
Some of you out there may have

1951
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,620
or may know people that have Cushing's,

1952
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,850
which is chronically elevated cortisol.

1953
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:13,330
There are prescription drugs
that we will talk about

1954
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,010
that can be used.

1955
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,650
But most people are dealing
with a situation where

1956
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:20,080
life gets stressful then less stressful,

1957
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,340
stressful then less stressful.

1958
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:26,340
I would say, based on the
data from McEwen and others,

1959
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,840
Bob Sapolsky's Lab over many years.

1960
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,620
I would say any stress that lasts

1961
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:34,440
more than a day or two days, or three days

1962
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,423
is starting to become chronic stress.

1963
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,690
There's really no strict cutoff

1964
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,760
because we're not measuring
everybody's cortisol

1965
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,593
from moment to moment.

1966
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:43,010
My lab has done experiments

1967
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,080
where we measure stress
in people over time.

1968
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,430
People vary tremendously

1969
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,340
in their ability to have a really hard day

1970
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,540
and then fall deeply asleep.

1971
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,530
That's going to be the ultimate reset

1972
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,580
is the ability to sleep well

1973
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,170
more or less undisturbed each night,

1974
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,000
although one or two wake
ups during the night,

1975
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,010
probably not going to be too detrimental

1976
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:00,670
provided they're not too long,

1977
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,210
and you're not viewing light

1978
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,300
during those wake-ups or your phone.

1979
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,060
But the things that you can take,

1980
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,700
if you feel like you're
chronically stressed

1981
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:08,840
and you're veering toward

1982
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,420
some of the negative
effects of stress are many.

1983
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:16,560
There are some simple
things that people can do

1984
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,680
in terms of supplementation.

1985
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,110
All supplements of course

1986
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:23,000
have to be checked out for
their safety margins for you,

1987
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,670
because there going to
differ from person to person.

1988
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,360
You're responsible for making
sure they're safe for you

1989
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,720
if you decide to use them.

1990
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,520
One of the most common ones is Ashwagandha

1991
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:37,140
and it has a powerful
anxiolytic anti-anxiety effect.

1992
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,790
You're welcome to go to
examine.com and for zero cost

1993
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:43,190
you can see their so-called
human effect matrix.

1994
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,140
Ashwagandha has many uses,

1995
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,890
It's been used to enhance
power output in athletes

1996
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:54,740
it has been shown to modestly
increase testosterone.

1997
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,540
It has been shown to
modestly adjust things like

1998
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,120
low density lipoprotein cholesterol,

1999
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,860
the so-called bad cholesterol in quotes.

2000
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,870
It has a profound effect on anxiety

2001
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,480
that's been shown in nine studies.

2002
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,310
Nine peer reviewed independent studies,

2003
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:11,500
mean funded by organizations
that have no vested interest

2004
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,030
in the answer.

2005
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:17,130
It has a very strong
effect on cortisol itself.

2006
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:17,970
How strong?

2007
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,090
The decrease in cortisol noted in humans

2008
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,440
is 14.5 to 27.9% reduction

2009
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,830
in otherwise healthy but stressed humans.

2010
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:28,663
That's great.

2011
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:30,130
Six studies.

2012
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:32,480
And it mentions there's
a significantly larger

2013
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,820
than many other supplements.

2014
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,930
Now, some people will say

2015
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:39,330
that taking Ashwagandha
chronically may not be good.

2016
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,590
If you've heard about that,

2017
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:43,510
or you can point to specific studies

2018
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,240
that indicate exactly why it's not good,

2019
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,280
please put in the comment
section or let me know.

2020
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,260
In the comment section
on YouTube would be best.

2021
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,680
The studies that I'm referring
to did explore both genders.

2022
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,490
The number of subjects was
reasonably high, 64 or more.

2023
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:02,390
One to six months study,

2024
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:03,650
so these were long-term studies.

2025
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,050
That's great, you like to see that

2026
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,070
not just in an acute study.

2027
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:10,540
So males and females
lots of different ages

2028
01:22:12,222 --> 01:22:14,570
overweight and non overweight.

2029
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,180
They did blood draws of cortisol

2030
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,250
which is going to end and
as well as saliva test.

2031
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,400
Saliva is actually the best
way to measure free cortisol.

2032
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,340
You can also measure it
from ear wax it turns out

2033
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,570
which sounds pretty gross and kind of is.

2034
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:29,340
But nonetheless that's where
cortisol will accumulate

2035
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,020
in earwax and in saliva,
the free cortisol.

2036
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:36,630
But that's six very quality studies,

2037
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:41,030
independently supported
that all points to these

2038
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:44,700
very significant, you know,
14.5 to 27.9% reductions

2039
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,880
in otherwise healthy adults.

2040
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,050
So if you're somebody who is
dealing with chronic stress,

2041
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,680
it's a stressful period in your life

2042
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,610
and you want to stave off the
negative effects of stress.

2043
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:56,110
Well then ashwagandha may,

2044
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:57,800
I want to highlight, may be right for you.

2045
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,220
It also does tend to lower total cortisol

2046
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:01,270
which is interesting.

2047
01:23:02,498 --> 01:23:06,540
It can lower depression to
at somewhat minimal degree,

2048
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:09,090
and can lower as I
mentioned before things like

2049
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:10,393
low density lipoprotein.

2050
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:14,592
I think ashwagandha
comes through is kind of

2051
01:23:14,592 --> 01:23:17,420
the heavy hitter in department.

2052
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,780
Now what's interesting also

2053
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:21,040
is the other effects of ashwagandha

2054
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,970
that are downstream of reducing
chronic stress and cortisol,

2055
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:24,803
'cause cortisol has so many effects,

2056
01:23:24,803 --> 01:23:28,490
there're receptors for cortisol
all over the body and brain.

2057
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:30,520
And so I'll just list these off quickly,

2058
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,020
I'm not going to list off each study

2059
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:33,860
or talk about how many subjects in detail.

2060
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:36,050
Again, you can go to
examine.com if you want,

2061
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,540
and just put it in Ashwagandha.

2062
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,220
See reactive protein,

2063
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:44,080
which is a marker of all sorts
of negative health effects.

2064
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:47,920
Cardiovascular health,
even macular degeneration

2065
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,760
is notably reduced.

2066
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,170
Heart palpitations notably reduced.

2067
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:55,420
serum T3 and T4, our old friends
from the thyroid hormones

2068
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,373
from a previous episode are increased.

2069
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,840
Symptoms of OCD decreased,

2070
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,416
both the obsessions and the compulsion's

2071
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:04,736
right obsessions are of the mind

2072
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,569
compulsions are of behavior.

2073
01:24:06,934 --> 01:24:09,940
So there are a lot of
things that are downstream

2074
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,563
of reducing cortisol.

2075
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:16,220
Lowered heart rate,
lowered rates of insomnia,

2076
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,160
slightly improved memory.

2077
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,460
Why that would be, I don't know,

2078
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:21,730
because cortisol in the short
term can increase memory,

2079
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,970
I'm guessing it's from increased sleep.

2080
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:27,000
Decreased pain, increased
quality of you know...

2081
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,080
Decreased reaction times,
things of that sort.

2082
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,600
So the list goes on and on,

2083
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,130
but all of those things stem downstream

2084
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,640
of decreased cortisol.

2085
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,240
So if one were to decide
to take ashwagandha

2086
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,210
in order to reduce cortisol,

2087
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:41,310
given that you want
cortisol early in the day

2088
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,440
to have energy throughout the day,

2089
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,700
the time to take it as
probably later in the day

2090
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,000
or in the evening.

2091
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,930
I've never heard of it preventing sleep

2092
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:51,230
or causing insomnia of any kind.

2093
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,690
That certainly wasn't listed

2094
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:55,570
as one of the major
effects on examine.com.

2095
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,470
I will take ashwagandha from time to time

2096
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,600
if I'm chronically stressed,

2097
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,190
or if I'm not sleeping
as well as I ought to.

2098
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,490
You might think that with all my knowledge

2099
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,990
about sleep and sleep protocols

2100
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,350
that I would sleep perfectly every night,

2101
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,400
but unfortunately I have a dog that has

2102
01:25:08,702 --> 01:25:11,210
a canine form of of
sundowners, of dementia,

2103
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:13,550
so he's up much of the night, these days.

2104
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:14,650
And so there's no way

2105
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:17,210
I'm getting a solid night of sleep lately.

2106
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,340
And so I will supplement with ashwagandha

2107
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,040
and typically I'll take it before sleep

2108
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,660
and maybe also with my
last meal of the day,

2109
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,750
which is at least two
hours before I go to sleep.

2110
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,360
Again you have to decide
if it's right for you.

2111
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,990
The dosages can vary tremendously.

2112
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:32,940
I would just go buy

2113
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:35,700
what's on the bottle
from a reputable brand.

2114
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,630
I would also check out examine.com,

2115
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:40,350
because it mentions a range of dosages

2116
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:41,210
that people have used.

2117
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:44,010
And in various studies
to different effects.

2118
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,520
Now, there is something out there

2119
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,720
that some of you may actually
be taking or ingesting

2120
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,820
that can increase cortisol

2121
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,220
and not so incidentally

2122
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,040
can decrease estrogen and testosterone.

2123
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,020
Because remember cortisol

2124
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,830
is made from the cholesterol molecule

2125
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:00,290
so is estrogen and testosterone.

2126
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:02,930
So are estrogen and
testosterone, excuse me,

2127
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:05,600
and it's competitive.

2128
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,440
So you're either making more cortisol,

2129
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,200
or you're making more of
the sex steroid hormones,

2130
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,730
estrogen and testosterone.

2131
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:14,680
Believe it or not liquorice,

2132
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,240
which I always thought of as a candy,

2133
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,030
but liquorice contains a
substance that I can't pronounce.

2134
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:25,170
G L Y C Y R R H I Z I N.

2135
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:30,170
Glycyrrhizin, which is of
the glabra species of plant,

2136
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:35,670
actually because of its chemistry,

2137
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:39,230
this 18-beta-hydroxy-cholenoic acid,

2138
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,300
you don't need to know all that.

2139
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:43,690
Liquorice, black liquorice
contains a substance

2140
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,000
that increases cortisol,

2141
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,060
and it's increases not
huge, but it is significant.

2142
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:54,770
This has been looked at
in females age 18 to 29,

2143
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:57,760
males and females age 18 to 29,

2144
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,930
people age 30.

2145
01:26:58,930 --> 01:26:59,920
These are separate studies

2146
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,210
where I'm listing off the different ages,

2147
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:03,300
ages 30 to 64.

2148
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,750
It turns out that you can see

2149
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:09,750
pretty substantial
increases in serum cortisol

2150
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:13,170
and decreases in
testosterone and estrogen.

2151
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:14,510
So that was complete news to me.

2152
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:16,150
Also increases in blood pressure

2153
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:17,440
that are pretty substantial.

2154
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,810
That's going to be downstream of cortisol,

2155
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:21,810
increasing cortisol
increase blood pressure

2156
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,380
in order to engage the stress response

2157
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,920
as part of the stress response.

2158
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,680
Increased hormones of other kinds

2159
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,860
that are associated with stress.

2160
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:30,780
Who knew?

2161
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,560
I didn't know maybe you knew,

2162
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,890
previously if you did forgive me

2163
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:36,300
but licorice and some of the
compounds in black licorice

2164
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,640
can actually increase stress.

2165
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,170
Probably not the thing to be ingesting

2166
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:42,360
during periods of chronic stress.

2167
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,860
Whether or not anyone
has had positive effects

2168
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,610
of using it to increase
cortisol and other contexts,

2169
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,540
let me know,

2170
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,650
but very interesting that
the chemistry of licorice

2171
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:53,800
increases stress hormones,

2172
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,250
and therefore you would probably want to,

2173
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,420
almost certainly we want to avoid it

2174
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:00,550
in conditions of chronic stress.

2175
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:02,880
Also, if you're trying to
optimize testosterone and estrogen

2176
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,270
liquorice seems like a bad idea.

2177
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,830
I suppose one instance where
you might want to use licorice

2178
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:08,960
would be if you're traveling

2179
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,460
and you're trying to wake
up at a particular location,

2180
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,500
because licorice has
these effects on cortisol

2181
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,500
and cortisol is associated
with the waking phenomenon

2182
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,110
and alertness and energy,

2183
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:22,710
you could use it in that regard.

2184
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:25,560
However, I would be careful to time it

2185
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,393
so that you're not getting

2186
01:28:26,393 --> 01:28:29,390
two cortisol increases
throughout the day, two peaks.

2187
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,900
So you're going to want to make sure

2188
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:34,330
that you're doing all the other
things correct for jet lag

2189
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:35,800
and adjusting to jet lag.

2190
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,750
And if you want to know
what those things are,

2191
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:39,240
including timing your feeding,

2192
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,490
using temperature, using exercise,

2193
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,940
using light to adjust
to jet lag more quickly,

2194
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:47,020
please see the episode that we
did on jet lag and shift work

2195
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,380
where I cover all those
protocols in detail.

2196
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:52,240
The other compound that I
think deserves attention

2197
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,330
is apigenin.

2198
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:57,040
A P I G E N I N, apigenin.

2199
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,300
which is what's found in chamomile.

2200
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,740
Apigenin I've talked about previously.

2201
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:08,600
It has various effects one
is it is a mild anti-estrogen

2202
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,260
that's been shown in various studies,

2203
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,810
and it does have a bit
of an anxiolytic effect

2204
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:14,330
of reducing anxiety.

2205
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:17,140
I take it before bedtime, 50 milligrams.

2206
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,460
Again, you have to decide

2207
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,380
or figure out if that's
safe for you or not.

2208
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,200
I'm not suggesting you take it.

2209
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,420
The major source of action is
to calm the nervous system.

2210
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:28,310
And it does that primarily

2211
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,730
by adjusting things like
GABA and chloride channels

2212
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:33,730
but it also has a mild
effect in reducing cortisol.

2213
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:36,033
So Ashwagandha and Apigenin together,

2214
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,420
I would consider the most potent

2215
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,740
commercial compounds
that are in supplement

2216
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:45,940
non-prescription form that one could use

2217
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,370
if they were interested in
reducing chronic stress,

2218
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:50,120
especially late in the day

2219
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,910
by way of reducing
cortisol late in the day.

2220
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,420
So you're probably getting
the impression that

2221
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,200
cortisol and epinephrine are
a bit of a double-edged sword.

2222
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,270
You want them elevated, but
not for too long or too much.

2223
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,870
You don't want them up for
days and days, and days,

2224
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:05,980
but you do want to have a practice

2225
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,950
in order to increase
them in the short term.

2226
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:12,610
So we should talk about protocols

2227
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:17,610
that can set a foundation
of cortisol and epinephrine

2228
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,710
that is headed towards optimal.

2229
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,110
Optimization is always
going to be a series

2230
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:24,110
of regular practices
that you do every day.

2231
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:25,240
So sleeping at certain times,

2232
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,810
light at specific times,
food at specific times.

2233
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:29,890
Certain foods, et cetera,
and that's highly individual,

2234
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,120
but there are some universals

2235
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,710
and we've covered a number of
those in the discussion today.

2236
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:39,010
Meal timing, meal schedules
has a profound effect

2237
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:40,960
on energy levels.

2238
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,100
And as I mentioned before

2239
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:45,780
the energy I'm referring
to is not glucose energy.

2240
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,630
It's not burning carbs
while running or ketones.

2241
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:50,390
What I'm talking about is neural energy,

2242
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,963
epinephrine and cortisol.

2243
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:55,940
Fasting and timing one's eating

2244
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,870
are two sides of the same coin.

2245
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,930
So even if you're on a kind
of standard three meal a day

2246
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,540
with a couple of snacks in between diet

2247
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:04,760
or nutrition regimen,

2248
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,420
you are fasting whenever you're asleep,

2249
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,050
or you're not ingesting any calories.

2250
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,190
So unless you're hooked
up to an IV of glucose

2251
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:12,120
you are fasting while you're sleeping.

2252
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,100
There are several
different kinds of fasting

2253
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,290
that can relate to
epinephrine and cortisol.

2254
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:20,130
I will do an entire episode
on optimizing food intake

2255
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,620
for performance in the sports context.

2256
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:26,640
That's coming up but in the meantime,

2257
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,860
I'd like to just talk about

2258
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:32,000
fasting as a source of epinephrine.

2259
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,010
Anytime when our blood glucose is low

2260
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,270
cortisol and epinephrine
are going to go up.

2261
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:39,740
If we fast for too long, that is stress.

2262
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:40,680
There's no way around that.

2263
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,130
Now that doesn't mean it doesn't have

2264
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:44,610
other beneficial effects.

2265
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:46,360
Running a marathon is stress,

2266
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,840
but it can also have positive
effects if that's your thing.

2267
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,880
So stress has been demonized as a term,

2268
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,750
but we want to think about
stress mechanistically,

2269
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,310
as epinephrine and cortisol.

2270
01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:58,820
And then if we do that

2271
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:01,450
we can think about how
to regulate its timing.

2272
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:05,060
So anytime we haven't eaten
for four to six hours,

2273
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,460
levels of epinephrine and cortisol

2274
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,520
are going to go up pretty substantially.

2275
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,710
There's an exception to that,

2276
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:11,670
which is if you are used to eating

2277
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:14,690
on the clock every two hours or every hour

2278
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:15,970
being half hour late,

2279
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,310
or being even 10 minutes
late on that schedule

2280
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,210
will induce stress.

2281
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,740
Most of that psychological stress,

2282
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,340
but also the release
of things like ghrelin

2283
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,280
that are going to make you hungry,

2284
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,380
'cause they're on that eating clock.

2285
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:30,150
So one thing that many
people do to great benefit

2286
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:33,520
is they follow a so-called
circadian eating schedule.

2287
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,680
They eat only when the sun is up,

2288
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,540
they stop when the sun is down.

2289
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,500
More or less.

2290
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,540
The another way to think about this

2291
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,730
is they stop eating a
couple hours before sleep

2292
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:44,470
and they eat more or less upon waking

2293
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:45,620
assuming that they're waking up

2294
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:48,760
more or less around the
time of the sunrises,

2295
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,500
maybe plus or minus two hours.

2296
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,820
Okay. So sort of typical schedule.

2297
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:55,740
Now, let's say you decide to do what I do,

2298
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:56,950
which is I skip breakfast.

2299
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:57,810
I drink water,

2300
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,090
I delay my caffeine for
90 minutes to two hours,

2301
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:01,500
and then I drink my caffeine.

2302
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,110
And then my first meal is
typically around lunchtime,

2303
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:05,290
11:30 or 12:00.

2304
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:07,080
And yes, occasionally I throw back

2305
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,880
some almonds or walnuts or
something earlier in the day.

2306
01:33:10,798 --> 01:33:12,298
I do do that from time to time

2307
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,570
if I get hungry enough,

2308
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:15,900
or if I just happen to see them.

2309
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,340
I'm kind of a drive by eater,

2310
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,877
if I see blueberries or nuts or something

2311
01:33:18,877 --> 01:33:21,080
I'm just going to pick them
up and put them in my mouth.

2312
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,410
I try not do that off
other people's plates,

2313
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:26,360
but I just have that habit of
doing that from time to time.

2314
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,210
But typically I don't
eat until about noon.

2315
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:30,920
So I've got a cortisol increase

2316
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,200
I've got my sunlight in the morning.

2317
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,000
So I'm getting a big pulse
and energy early in the day.

2318
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,450
And yes, there's a
little bit of agitation,

2319
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:39,390
I am hungry sometimes early
in the day sometimes no,

2320
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:41,670
but my ghrelin system is used to

2321
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:44,050
kicking in right around noon.

2322
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:45,470
At the point where I eat

2323
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:48,140
as long as I don't eat carbohydrate

2324
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,650
in my case, I know that
my epinephrine levels

2325
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:51,800
are going to stay pretty high.

2326
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,260
So for me, it's usually meat and salad,

2327
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,710
or something of that
sort, or fish and salad.

2328
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:59,170
although I don't
particularly like eating fish

2329
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:00,940
because of the taste,

2330
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,670
but I'm assuming low carb or ketones ish

2331
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,810
throughout the day.

2332
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:07,360
So I'm probably in a
slightly elevated state

2333
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,520
of epinephrine and cortisol
throughout the day.

2334
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,060
Some of you are fasting even longer.

2335
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:13,160
You're pushing out till
4:00 PM or 8:00 PM,

2336
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,530
or maybe you're even
fasting around the clock.

2337
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,900
Anytime you're fasting

2338
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,940
you're increasing epinephrine
and cortisol release.

2339
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,740
You can do all the meditation in the world

2340
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,230
to keep your mind calm,

2341
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:26,460
but you are closer to that edge of stress.

2342
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,550
And you're closer to
that edge of peak stress.

2343
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:32,470
So that's something that's
just important to understand

2344
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:34,640
the description about
comfort foods and cortisol

2345
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:37,070
was one of kind of an extreme case

2346
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:38,280
where cortisol systems

2347
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,150
kick over to a positive feedback loop.

2348
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:44,200
But we all eat to suppress
cortisol and epinephrine.

2349
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,080
When we're hungry cortisol and epinephrine

2350
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,370
create an agitation so we go seek food.

2351
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:50,470
When we ingest food

2352
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:52,020
typically if it includes carbohydrate,

2353
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,360
there's a blunting of cortisol.

2354
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,270
There's a blunting of
epinephrine in the bloodstream.

2355
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:57,250
If you've ever had too
much coffee to drink

2356
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,440
and you go and have a
couple of pieces of bread,

2357
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,810
you will feel the...

2358
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,990
You might describe it as the caffeine

2359
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:04,520
getting soaked up out of your system,

2360
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,730
but what you're doing is
you're elevating blood glucose

2361
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:09,310
which is more or less saturating

2362
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:10,860
the effect of caffeine in your system.

2363
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:14,570
Not completely, but it's
going to have that effect.

2364
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:16,480
If you're very stressed and
you sit down to eat something

2365
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,070
it will calm you down.

2366
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,100
Yes. Because some of the blood
that goes to your stomach

2367
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,470
but more so because of these effects

2368
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:23,310
in blunting cortisol and epinephrine.

2369
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,290
So the important point here is that

2370
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:27,230
if you want to be alert

2371
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:30,240
you can do that by way of not eating.

2372
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,910
Of course, please ingest fluids.

2373
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:33,800
I know some people water fast out there.

2374
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,410
I am yet to see good
science on water fasting

2375
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,100
and why that can stimulate stem cells,

2376
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,970
or people love the idea of

2377
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:42,227
after the Nobel prize
was given for autophagy

2378
01:35:42,227 --> 01:35:44,550
and this idea that our
cells clean up debris

2379
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:46,470
in senescent cells, yes, that's true.

2380
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:49,720
But the idea that water fasting
is going to promote that,

2381
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,860
I find rather amusing.

2382
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:51,830
Please send me the data

2383
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:53,980
if you know of some great
study in a decent journal,

2384
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:56,320
but pretty much this is
something I hear about.

2385
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,710
I don't think water
fasting is a good idea,

2386
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:00,930
nor should you be drinking so much water

2387
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:01,763
that you kill yourself.

2388
01:36:01,763 --> 01:36:04,940
You can actually drink
enough water that you die.

2389
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,550
So I think ingesting
water in healthy amounts

2390
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:08,960
is a good thing, stay hydrated.

2391
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,120
But if you want to be alert stay hydrated,

2392
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,320
caffeine may or may
not be in your regimen,

2393
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:19,320
but fasting will make sure that
your levels of energy are up

2394
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,640
and you will be primed very well for doing

2395
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,470
a protocol of the sort
that we talked about

2396
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:25,800
earlier in this episode.

2397
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,090
Of breathing, or cold
exposure, or exercise

2398
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:31,110
to get that increase in
the immune system function.

2399
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:32,940
And if you do that after learning

2400
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,480
after trying to learn something,

2401
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,710
it will increase learning

2402
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:38,520
for that particular set of information,

2403
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,960
whether or not it's motor, or language,

2404
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,450
or whatever it happens to be.

2405
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,500
Mathematics, programming.

2406
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,580
So fasting is a tool for many reasons,

2407
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,750
it can increase growth hormone, et cetera.

2408
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:52,550
But today I'm talking
about fasting as a tool

2409
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:55,350
to bias your system toward more

2410
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,830
epinephrine adrenaline release

2411
01:36:56,830 --> 01:36:58,610
and toward more cortisol release

2412
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:01,920
but still low enough that
it's not chronic stress,

2413
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,200
that it's not causing
negative health effects.

2414
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:08,350
But please know that if
life is very, very stressful

2415
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:11,010
if you're experiencing lots of stressors

2416
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:13,520
and you're chronically fasting,

2417
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,280
you are positioning yourself
toward a greater likelihood

2418
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,330
of being chronically stressed

2419
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:20,850
in the ways that are negative.

2420
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:22,560
Negative effects on the
reproductive access,

2421
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,890
lower testosterone and estrogen.

2422
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:27,440
Negative effects on you're
hair will turn gray,

2423
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,640
there's reasons for that,

2424
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,160
Your sleep will suffer.

2425
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,890
Your immune system will suffer.

2426
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:34,770
So I think while it's nuanced

2427
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:39,860
our discussion today about
epinephrine and cortisol

2428
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:44,860
increasing energy and immunity
are designed to help you

2429
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,290
understand when you should
be doing certain things.

2430
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:49,710
When you should throttle back.

2431
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:52,210
When you might want to kick
up your adrenaline a bit,

2432
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:54,350
if you're suffering from low energy

2433
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:56,630
because you're just kind of feeling down

2434
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:58,940
and a little bit under activated,

2435
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,880
well then the practices of ice baths

2436
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,570
and intense breathing, et cetera,

2437
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:05,950
could be very beneficial so might fasting.

2438
01:38:05,950 --> 01:38:10,060
But if you're feeling
exhausted and burnt out

2439
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,010
sort of drained and stressed

2440
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:16,180
well then fasting or doing
a lot of cold exposure,

2441
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,900
or doing a lot of intense exercise

2442
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,980
is driving you further and
further into chronic stress.

2443
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:24,900
So because I don't have a
saliva test or a blood test,

2444
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,570
or God forbid an earwax test
to measure your cortisol

2445
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,910
as we're engaging in
this discussion together,

2446
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:33,460
you have to gauge for yourself

2447
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:36,780
whether or not you are in
a state of under activated

2448
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:38,983
and need more epinephrine and cortisol,

2449
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:43,640
or whether or not you are over activated,

2450
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,170
in terms of cortisol and epinephrine.

2451
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:48,360
And you need ways to
buffer those ashwagandha,

2452
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,130
Maybe it should be a warm
mellow bath not an ice bath.

2453
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,950
So one has to learn how
to regulate these hormones

2454
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:55,450
with behavior, with nutrition,

2455
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:56,980
perhaps with supplementation.

2456
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:58,780
And then of course there
are prescription drugs,

2457
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,140
and I always leave these to the end

2458
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,870
because A, I'm not a medical doctor

2459
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:04,110
I'm not prescribing anything.

2460
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:04,943
I'm a professor,

2461
01:39:04,943 --> 01:39:05,980
I'm professing a number of things

2462
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:09,520
that you can decide for
yourselves what to do with or not.

2463
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,860
But of course there are prescription drugs

2464
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:15,170
that can increase cortisol
or decrease cortisol

2465
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:16,740
in cases like Cushing's syndrome,

2466
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:19,030
which if you have that diagnosed,

2467
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:20,700
you should talk to a physician.

2468
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,610
You should talk ideally
to a endocrinologist

2469
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:25,290
but to a physician of some sort,

2470
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:26,793
board certified physician.

2471
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,820
There are drugs that can
be used to treat injury

2472
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:33,090
like corticosteroids,

2473
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:35,250
that you can inject to
reduce inflammation injury,

2474
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,700
but they are cortisol.

2475
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,640
So they're going to bias
you towards more stress

2476
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,490
in other domains.

2477
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:41,970
Remember cortisol can cross
the blood brain barrier

2478
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,460
so you're going to be more
prone to psychological stress.

2479
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,810
I also want to mention again,

2480
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:48,080
that I think there's great
benefit to having a practice

2481
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,370
that perhaps you do every other day,

2482
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:53,040
but if you can't maybe every
third day or every other day

2483
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,310
of deliberately increasing
your adrenaline in your body

2484
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:58,550
while learning to stay calm in the mind,

2485
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:01,330
so that you learn to separate
the brain body experience.

2486
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:04,120
You know, we hear so much
about how beneficial it is

2487
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,710
to unify the brain and body,

2488
01:40:05,710 --> 01:40:08,370
that we're all out of touch
with our brain and bodies.

2489
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:11,700
I particularly dislike claims like that

2490
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,610
or statements like that

2491
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:16,200
because there's great
power as we learned today

2492
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:20,340
in having your body activated
by some sort of stimulus,

2493
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:22,820
cold water or even psychological stress,

2494
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:25,030
but learning to stay calm in your mind.

2495
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:27,800
I should just remind you that most of the

2496
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,840
negative effects on your life
and on the lives of others

2497
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,030
are due to people perhaps you I hope not

2498
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,900
being unable to regulate their mind

2499
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,040
when they have high levels
of adrenaline in their body,

2500
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,650
either 'cause they read
something on a text

2501
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:42,210
or a comment section,

2502
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,060
of course that never happens to me,

2503
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,290
but it may happen to you.

2504
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,810
Of course it happens to me,

2505
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:49,960
but the idea is to stay calm in your mind

2506
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,480
so that then you can
regulate your action, right?

2507
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,150
And so I think that
there are these practices

2508
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:57,400
that one can develop over time

2509
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,347
that are really straight
forward and zero costs, right?

2510
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:03,350
You could find any number of ways

2511
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:06,120
to increase your adrenaline and stay calm.

2512
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:09,050
And we tend to focus
on things like exercise

2513
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:10,780
as the way that we get our energy up.

2514
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:13,090
But today, again I'm talking about

2515
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:15,200
deliberately increasing adrenaline

2516
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:17,420
while staying calm mentally,

2517
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:18,960
because that has great utility

2518
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,930
when the adrenaline hits
through unwanted events,

2519
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:25,990
through things that we didn't seek out.

2520
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:30,030
So the ability to regulate
adrenaline cortisol

2521
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:32,620
is about inducing them deliberately

2522
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,280
when you want to push back on infection,

2523
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,890
potential infection from bacteria viruses.

2524
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:40,830
It's about pulling back on
adrenaline and cortisol,

2525
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:42,450
maybe through the use of supplementation

2526
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:45,740
but certainly through proper
use of light and sleep

2527
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:48,200
and mental tools that
we talked about as well

2528
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,870
when they are chronically elevated.

2529
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:52,760
It's about training your system,

2530
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,930
not just to be unified at brain and body,

2531
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:57,110
which sounds great until you're stressed

2532
01:41:57,110 --> 01:41:58,280
and then that's terrible.

2533
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,390
It's really about having
a deliberate dissociation

2534
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,443
between the adrenaline
response from the adrenals

2535
01:42:03,443 --> 01:42:06,640
and the adrenaline response
from the brainstem.

2536
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,350
So once again, we've
covered a ton of material.

2537
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:12,710
I hope right now, you're thinking,

2538
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:15,300
okay, am I in state of chronic stress?

2539
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,420
Am I under activated?

2540
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:19,100
Or could I afford to increase my levels

2541
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:21,770
of adrenaline cortisol to
improve my relationship

2542
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:26,130
to my immune system and
to energy, neural energy.

2543
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:29,430
If you like the information
that you heard today

2544
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:30,810
and you want to remember it,

2545
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:33,570
well, then at the end of this episode,

2546
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:34,640
perhaps you go do something

2547
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,910
to increase your level of adrenaline.

2548
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,230
And now you know what
some of those things are,

2549
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:40,060
because it will help you
retain the information,

2550
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:41,460
or you could apply that to anything else

2551
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:44,040
that you learn or experience of course.

2552
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,890
And I hope that you'll think about

2553
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:50,680
some of the ways in which
cortisol and adrenaline

2554
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,070
are not good or bad, that
stresses in good or bad

2555
01:42:53,070 --> 01:42:54,940
but short-term stress is healthy.

2556
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:56,370
Alertness and energy is healthy

2557
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:58,810
even if it puts you at
the edge of agitation,

2558
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:00,010
that's an opportunity

2559
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:02,350
to learn how to control
these hormones better.

2560
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:04,510
And I hope that if you're
in a state of chronic stress

2561
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:05,570
that you'll do things

2562
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:08,560
to start tamping down some of that stress

2563
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,727
and that you realize
that your nervous system

2564
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:13,090
and your hormone system are linked,

2565
01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:14,940
but they're linked in
ways that you can control,

2566
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,150
that we don't have to be
slaves to our hormones.

2567
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:19,430
And certainly not the
hormones that cause us stress,

2568
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:20,820
we can learn to control those

2569
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,440
both to the benefit of our body

2570
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,310
and benefit of mind.

2571
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:25,930

2589
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:06,780
as well as suggestions
for future episodes.

2590
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,510
We do read all the comments

2591
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:10,810
and I know many of you
are anxiously awaiting

2592
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:13,050
particular topics and episodes,

2593
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:14,830
and we will eventually get to them all,

2594
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:16,390
I'm not going anywhere.

2595
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:19,170
And we do want to be
thorough about every topic.

2596
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,910
Today we rounded out the
discussion about hormones.

2597
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:25,090
We aren't going to continue
with that topic any longer,

2598
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:27,210
we are moving to a new topic segment

2599
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:29,370
for an entire month or so.

2600
01:44:29,370 --> 01:44:31,570
If you know of other people
that you think could benefit

2601
01:44:31,570 --> 01:44:33,450

2602
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:35,700
or that you think would
enjoy listening to it

2603
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,270
please forward it along to them,

2604
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:39,030
we'd really appreciate that.

2605
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:40,480
Another great way to support us

2606
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:42,080
is to check out our sponsors

2607
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:44,800
that we mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

2608
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,400
We also have a Patreon,

2609
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,380
it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

2610
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:50,950

2611
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:53,030
at any level that you like.

2612
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:56,360
I should mention that I will
be answering some questions

2613
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:59,780
that come up frequently in
the comment section on YouTube

2614
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,320
in Instagram Lives every once in a while.

2615
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,460
I am on Twitter @hubermanlab.

2616
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,900
I'm on Instagram, also @hubermanlab.

2617
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,720
And on Instagram from
time to time coming up

2618
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,460
I'm going to be discussing

2619
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:15,000
answers to your common questions
in these Instagram Lives

2620
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,010

2624
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,540
I covered a lot of different
types of tools today,

2625
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:27,210
behavioral tools, et cetera.

2626
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:28,900
But I did mention supplements.

2627
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:31,010
For those of you that are
interested in supplements

2628
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:34,470
we've partnered with Thorne, T H O R N E,

2629
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:35,790
because we believe them

2630
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:38,120
to have the highest levels
of stringency and quality

2631
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,380
in terms of supplement production,

2632
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,930
in terms of amounts of supplements

2633
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:44,940
in their different
formulations, et cetera.

2634
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:47,690

for what I hope was an
informative discussion

2644
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:15,930
and an actionable discussion

2645
01:46:15,930 --> 01:46:18,470
about how to increase
energy and the immune system

2646
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:22,630
by way of cortisol and
adrenaline epinephrine.

2647
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:25,960
I really appreciate your
willingness to learn new topics

2648

as well as to embrace
and think about new tools

2649
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,150
and whether or not they're right for you.

2650
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:33,491
