- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,350
to The Huberman Lab Podcast,

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,383
for everyday life.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,840
- I'm Andrew Huberman

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,910
and I'm a professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,010
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,430
This podcast is separate from

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,740
my teaching and research
roles at Stanford.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,880
It is however part of
my desire and effort,

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,150
to bring zero cost to consumer information

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,030
about science and science related tools.

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,240
In keeping with that theme,

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,330
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

15
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,010
Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

16
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,650
Inside Tracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,450
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,130
to help you better understand your body

19
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,300
and help you reach your health goals.

20
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm a big believer in
blood tests and DNA tests

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,330
for the simple reason

22
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,510
that many of the factors
that are important for

23
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,900
your short-term and long-term
health and overall wellbeing

24
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,930
can only be analyzed
from blood and DNA tests.

25
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,730
Things like metabolic
factors and hormone levels,

26
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,960
really can only be assessed
accurately from blood and DNA.

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,590
The thing I like about Inside Tracker is

28
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,380
you don't just get back
levels of different hormones

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,730
and metabolic factors and so forth,

30
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,960
you also get directives.

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,270
It has a dashboard that's very easy to use

32
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,470
that tells you based on your data,

33
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,120
what sorts of foods you might want to eat

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,640
more of or less of.

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,810
What forms of exercise

36
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,710
you might want to do more of or less of.

37
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,720
It's really a wonderful way to assess

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,030
how your behaviors and lifestyle choices

39
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,100
are interacting with what's going on

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,170
deep within your biology.

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,720
Inside Tracker makes all of
that super easy to understand.

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,010
It's also really easy to

43
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,180
get the blood tests and DNA tests taken.

44
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,490
You can go to a local location or

45
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,260
they can send somebody to
your home if you prefer that.

46
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,410

53
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,950
Today's episode is also
brought to you by Helix Sleep.

54
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,180
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

55
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,699
that are designed to
meet your sleep needs,

56
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,850
in order to optimize your sleep.

57
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,870
I've done several episodes of this podcast

58
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,890
and there's a ton of information out there

59
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,850
pointing to the fact that

60
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,140
getting really deep
restful sleep each night

61
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,680
is vital for mental and physical health.

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,107
And the mattress that you sleep on

63
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:25,500
and the pillow that you
use is very important

64
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,340
for getting optimal sleep.

65
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,730
Helix Sleep has a brief two
minute quiz that you can take.

66
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,840
It asks you questions like,
"Do you sleep on your side,

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,710
or your back or your stomach
or maybe you don't know?

68
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,300
Do you tend to run hot
or cold as you sleep

69
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,010
or maybe you don't know?"

70
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,330
That two minute quiz matches you

71
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,020
to a mattress and pillow

72
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,300
that's ideal for your sleep needs.

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,430
I took this quiz,

74
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,460
I matched to the mattress
they call "The Dusk," D-U-S-K.

75
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,160
And I've been sleeping
on "The Dusk" mattress

76
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,040
for many months now

77
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,530
and I've been sleeping better
than I ever have before.

78
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,740
It's really wonderful

79
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,340
to have a really good night's
sleep on a consistent basis.

80
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,940
It's a total game changer.

81
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,810
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

82
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,990
you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.

83
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,570
Take their two minutes sleep quiz

84
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,920
and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.

85
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,900
And you'll get up to $200 off

86
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,610
any of their mattress
orders and two free pillows.

87
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,780
So that's helixsleep.com/huberman.

88
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
Take the two minutes sleep quiz

89
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,830
they'll match you to a mattress.

90
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,090
And if you order one of their mattresses,

91
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,920
you'll get up to $200 off

92
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,600
any of their mattresses
and two free pillows.

93
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,840
They have a 10 year warranty

94
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,490
and you get to try out the mattress

95
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,300
for 100 nights risk-free

96
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,133
and if you don't like it

97
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,710
they'll pick it up and take it away.

98
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,570
If you love it, then you keep it.

99
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,180
And I think there's a very good chance

100
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,013
that you're going to love it,

101
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:38,350
I certainly loved mine.

102
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,360
And today's episode

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,950
is also brought to you by Athletic Greens.

104
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,820
Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

105
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,470
vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

106
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,940
I started using Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.

107
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,730
And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.

108
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,160
I started using Athletic
Greens because I found it

109
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,650
rather confusing to figure out

110
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,407
what vitamins and minerals to take.

111
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,870
And in Athletic Greens,

112
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,240
I get all the vitamins and minerals

113
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,110
I need to cover my bases.

114
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,640
As well probiotics are really important.

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,710
Probiotics have been shown
now in numerous studies

116
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,060
to be important for the gut microbiome,

117
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,050
which impacts the gut brain axis,

118
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,089
as well as various
aspects of bodily health.

119
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,509
So in Athletic Greens

120
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,880
I get vitamins, minerals and probiotics.

121
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,870
I also really like the way it tastes.

122
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,150
It's a greens drink,

123
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,440
so you mix it with some water.

124
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,540
You could mix it with something else

125
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,410
like juice if you like.

126
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,390
I mix mine with water and lemon juice

127
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,420
and I drink it once or twice a day.

128
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,670
If you want to try Athletic
Greens you can go to

129
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,080
athleticgreens.com/huberman.

130
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,270
And if you do that,

131
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,120
you'll claim their special offer,

132
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,750
which is to get a years
supply of vitamin D3 K2.

133
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,290
There's now also a wealth of data

134
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,330
showing that Vitamin D3 is important

135
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,490
for various aspects of
brain and body health.

136
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,780
So that's athleticgreens.com/huberman

137
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,520
for Athletic Greens and a
years supply of Vitamin D3 K2.

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,210
You'll also get five free travel packets.

139
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,810
The travel packets are just
a really convenient way

140
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,520
to take Athletic Greens
when you're on the road,

141
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,370
in the car or on a plane
or just moving around.

142
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,060
You just empty one of the packets

143
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,760
into a water bottle or a glass

144
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,060
and mix it up really quickly.

145
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,880
It saves any kind of mess
or anything of that sort.

146
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,130
So once again athleticgreens.com/huberman

147
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,770
to get Vitamin D3 K2.

148
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,800
That's a year supply and
the five free travel packs.

149
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,680
It's a new month,

150
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,480
which means it's a new topic

151
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,010
here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.

152
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,170
For the next four or so episodes,

153
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,060
we're going to be talking all about

154
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,420
hormone affects on the brain and body.

155
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,090
So that's a huge number
of different topics.

156
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,080
We're going to talk about sex.

157
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,300
We're going to talk about reproduction.

158
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,940
We're going to talk about
puberty a little bit more.

159
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,040
We talked about that
in a previous episode.

160
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,700
We're going to talk about menopause.

161
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,550
We're going to talk about birth control.

162
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,880
We are going to talk about

163
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,540
aggression, competition, winning, losing.

164
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,960
Basically, we're going to
cover as much about hormones

165
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,010
as we possibly can in this month

166
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,200
and in doing so

167
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,180
we are going to go deep
into tools and protocols.

168
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,450
We are also going to talk about a lot of

169
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,800
tools that relate to things

170
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,530
that you might not want to do in order to

171
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,870
optimize hormone health,

172
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,760
regardless of stage of life
or your goals et cetera.

173
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,160
So it's sure to be a month
rich with discussion,

174
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,790
rich with tools and you're
going to learn a lot of

175
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,330
neuroscience and endocrinology.

176
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,770
There's actually a field
of neuro-endocrinology.

177
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,560
It's actually where I
started my graduate work.

178
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,010
I did a masters in it.

179
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,960
Which has only to say
that I love the topic.

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,590
I have a lot of friends
that work on this topic,

181
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,760
many of whom I've consulted
for these episodes.

182
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,440
And I'm really excited to
share the information with you.

183
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,607
Before we dive into today's episode,

184
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,670
"All About Emotions and Sex."

185
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,290
I want to just to have a few announcements

186
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,750
that are designed to point
you to some useful resources.

187
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,870
Last episode, "Talking
About The Science of

188
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,680
Emotions and Relationships."

189
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,830
I mentioned the Mood Meter app.

190
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,813
The Mood Meter App was developed by

191
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:02,500
people out at Yale University who study

192
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,460
the biology and psychology of emotions.

193
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,130
It's a really wonderful app.

194
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,735
However, many of you quickly told me

195
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:12,950
that the Mood Meter App
isn't available in your area.

196
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,120
You went to the link we posted

197
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,150
and it just was saying not
available in your area.

198
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,970
The situation was actually
a lot worse than that.

199
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,290
The situation was that,

200
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,850
when we recorded the episode

201
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,110
the Mood Meter App was working.

202
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,320
I know 'cause I downloaded a
fresh copy of it to my phone.

203
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
And then in the ensuing weekend,

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,270
they took the Mood Meter
App down for some repairs.

205
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,159
The Mood Meter app is now up.

206
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,650
It is available.

207
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,177
I want to be really clear.

208
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:37,810
It's not an app I'm affiliated with.

209
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,030
I'm just mentioning it to you.

210
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,863
They don't know me.

211
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,540
I know them, but they don't know me.

212
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,910
So we don't have any kind
of business relationship.

213
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,270
They do charge 99 cents for the app.

214
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,800
I think the free version has disappeared

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,220
in the last year or so.

216
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,400
So that's Mood Meter app.

217
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,090
We'll provide the link again

218
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,670
and the link should be working.

219
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,460
Hopefully they won't take it down again,

220
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,770
in between this announcement

221
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,640
and the release of this episode.

222
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,140
Also just want to take
a step back for a moment

223
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,530
and talk a little bit about the logic

224
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,300
of how to make the most of the information

225
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,410
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

226
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,440
I tend to throw out a lot of information

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,690
about a given topic.

228
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,460
Many of you have pointed out however,

229
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,730
that I don't cover certain things.

230
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,120
And once again I'll just say

231
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,470
the goal is always to be accurate,

232
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,160
but there's no way I can be exhaustive.

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,530
There's no way I can cover everything

234
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,730
for a particular topic.

235
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,640
The good news is we have time.

236
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,470
My goal, at least in the first year

237
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,179
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

238
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,519
is to give you a basis,

239
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,299
a foundation in these different topics

240
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:40,299
of neuro-plasticity, focus,
sleep, hormones et cetera.

241
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,559
And of course, to provide
tools along the way.

242
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,880
We are going to host guests,

243
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,970
I've actually started recording

244
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,660
with some of these guests already.

245
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,340
And even those episodes will include

246
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,960
a little what we call primer.

247
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,345
A little description of

248
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,260
the basics of a given topic

249
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,850
so that you can get more
information from those topics.

250
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,050
My goal really is to
educate you in these topics,

251
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,840
give you a foundation in these topics

252
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,560
and allow you to start exploring them

253
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,290
here in the episodes
with our future guests,

254
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,410
but also in other podcasts and books

255
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,230
and other sources of information.

256
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,477
So for those of you that are saying,

257
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:13,666
"It's too much information."

258
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,910
I just encourage you
to remind yourself that

259
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,730
you have a pause button
you can return to it.

260
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,970
Everything's timestamped.

261
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,803
For those of you that feel,

262
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:23,230
it's not enough information
I'm not covering enough.

263
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,480
Just know that this is just the beginning.

264
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
We didn't intend to do
this for a very long time

265
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,170
and we will be thorough over time.

266
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,750
So thanks for your patience

267
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,270
and please be patient with yourselves.

268
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,500
There's no reason why you have to digest

269
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,634
all the information in one swoop.

270
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:40,070
The other thing is that
I've been told both that

271
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,350
I speak too fast and speak too slow.

272
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,470
So there's a wonderful solution to this.

273
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,980
If I speak too fast or too slow

274
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,200
you can adjust the speed in YouTube.

275
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,500
If you're listening in a different format,

276
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,960
I think you also can adjust
the speed of playback.

277
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,130
So that's something that

278
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,440
wouldn't be possible in the classroom,

279
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,950
but you may find useful.

280
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,010
And then last but not least,

281
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,050
I want to point people again to this NSDR,

282
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,740
non-sleep deep rest protocol,

283
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,200
that the folks over at Madefor

284
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,180
have put out as a free resource.

285
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,220
It does, as many of you pointed out,

286
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,620
bear resemblance to things like

287
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,540
yoga nidra and other forms of meditation.

288
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
But what we've done is we've stripped out

289
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,090
intentions or any kind of
the verbiage related to

290
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,570
what some people might perceive as

291
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,181
kind of related to the yoga community or

292
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:29,870
specific to kind of new
age-y type techniques.

293
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,410
Not because we don't like yoga nidra.

294
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,490
In fact, I've done yoga nidra
daily for almost the last

295
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,700
goodness, eight years of my life.

296
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,000
I love yoga nidra,

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,640
but sometimes the complicated language

298
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,830
can be a separator and
can discourage people

299
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,490
from taking on these protocols
that are extremely useful.

300
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,670
So NSDR is intentionally generic.

301
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,450
It's designed to bring you into a state of

302
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,590
deep relaxation through a combination of

303
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,190
breathing and body scan.

304
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,840
There's the you too script over at Madefor

305
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,850
which is linked in the caption.

306
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,370
And many people find that they prefer that

307
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,180
to scripts like yoga nidra.

308
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,920
Scripts where they're doing intentions

309
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,310
and they're hearing a lot of

310
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,240
kind of unusual language
around the process.

311
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,980
This is just very basic and

312
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,813
I hope you'll enjoy it.

313
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:17,110
And if you prefer the more
typical yoga nidra scripts

314
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,100
then go with those.

315
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,260
There are many of them available

316
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,370
on the internet and elsewhere.

317
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,950
And last but not least I
want to point out that,

318
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,900
all our episodes now are subtitled

319
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,860
both in English and in Spanish.

320
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,070
So for those of you that prefer

321
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,660
to digest this information in Spanish,

322
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,340
that's now available to
you in the subtitles.

323
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,650
Today we're going to talk about

324
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,460
The Science of Sex.

325
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,560
In particular, sexual differentiation.

326
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,530
Now that's a complicated topic because

327
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,850
sex is both a adjective,
a noun and a verb,

328
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,990
depending on the context.

329
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,410
Today we're going to talk about

330
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,540
the hormonal effects

331
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,850
and the neural effects

332
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,360
of particular events that
happen during development

333
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,760
and how those guide
adolescent and adult behavior,

334
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,730
including sexual preference.

335
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,680
It's an area that's
fascinating and for which,

336
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,930
there are actually very
solid textbook findings.

337
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,910
So textbook findings means,

338
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,310
that there are many studies

339
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,530
that have been aggregated over decades.

340
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,240
That point to what we now know to be

341
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,430
absolute truths in terms of

342
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,740
how hormones affect brain development,

343
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,090
how the brain impacts hormonal development

344
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,793
and how those interact to
control behavior for instance.

345
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,220
We are also going to
talk about reproduction,

346
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,540
the verb sex.

347
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,930
And of course, sex the verb,

348
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,620
can also be carried out
independent of reproduction.

349
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,200
It's not always,

350
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,420
in particular in humans,

351
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,230
just to produce offspring.

352
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,070
So that's going to be
covered in the next episode,

353
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,420
but you absolutely need to understand

354
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,030
the information in this episode,

355
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,000
in order to make sense of the information

356
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,470
in the next episode.

357
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,670
So, today we're going to explore hormones.

358
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,080
What they are, how they work,

359
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,470
what leads to masculinization
or feminization

360
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,200
of the brain and body?

361
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,170
I'll just throw out one
really interesting fact

362
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,760
that perhaps most of
you didn't realize that

363
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,990
hormones have direct effects on the body.

364
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,450
Most people know that because there are

365
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,490
hormone differences and
sex differences in bodies

366
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,940
in terms of genitalia and body hair,

367
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,330
distribution of body hair et cetera.

368
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,190
But there are also effects of
hormones on the brain directly

369
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,110
and believe it or not
there're also effects

370
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,750
on the spinal cord.

371
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,620
On the neurons and structures
within the spinal cord

372
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,960
that impact in a very direct way,

373
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,670
what sorts of behaviors are possible.

374
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,180
So it's a fascinating area,

375
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,640
you might notice I'm going to go

376
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,800
a little bit more slowly
through this topic

377
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,760
than I normally do.

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,730
I want to be extremely
careful with my language.

379
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,540
Some of these topics,

380
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,980
some of you may be thinking
are extremely sensitive, right?

381
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,900
And of course,

382
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,000
any discussion about sex and reproduction

383
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,230
is a sensitive one.

384
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,370
But today we're just
talking about the biology.

385
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,280
We're not getting into
the cultural constraints

386
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
or the cultural dialogue.

387
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,430
What we're trying to do
today is really get to

388
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,520
the biology, the physiology,
the endocrinology

389
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,060
and the behavior.

390
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,609
So let's start by talking about

391
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:15,320
what hormones are just to remind you

392
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,070
and what they do.

393
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,170
Hormones by definition,

394
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,030
are a substance, a chemical that's

395
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,820
released in one area of the body.

396
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,040
Typically from something we call a gland,

397
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,500
although they can also
be released from neurons.

398
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,910
But they're released often from glands,

399
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,180
that travel and have
effects both on that gland

400
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,500
but also on other organs
and tissues in the body.

401
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,180
And that differentiates hormones

402
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,930
from things like neurotransmitters,

403
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,210
which tend to act more locally.

404
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,400
So that's important.

405
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,800
A hormone is a substance secreted

406
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,550
at one location in the body, travels,

407
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,670
and has impact on things
elsewhere in the body.

408
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,070
Examples of tissues that
produce hormones would be

409
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,740
the thyroid, the testes,
the ovaries et cetera.

410
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,810
And then of course there
are areas of the brain

411
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,940
like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,

412
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,660
which are closely related to one another

413
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,700
and release hormones
that cause the release

414
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,370
of yet other hormones out in the body.

415
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,370
So we're going to cover all this.

416
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,400
If you don't know anything
about endocrinology,

417
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,760
you're still going to be able to

418
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,700
understand today's discussion.

419
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,840
And we're going to start
with a discussion about,

420
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,000
what hormones actually do,

421
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,820
to create this thing that we call

422
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,290
masculinization or feminization.

423
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,250
So let's start with development.

424
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,530
Sperm meets egg.

425
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,750
Everything that happens before that

426
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,130
is a topic of the next episode.

427
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,600
But, sperm meets egg.

428
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,430
This is mammalian reproduction.

429
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,080
And that egg starts to duplicate,

430
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,770
it starts to make more of itself.

431
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,870
It makes more cells.

432
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,700
And eventually some of
those cells become skin.

433
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,250
Some of those cells become brain.

434
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,660
Some of those cells become muscle.

435
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,610
Some of those cells become fingers.

436
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,713
All the stuff that makes
up the brain and body plan.

437
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,300
In addition, there are hormones

438
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,540
that come both from the mother

439
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,957
and from the developing baby,

440
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:02,400
the developing fetus.

441
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,170
That impact. whether or
not the brain will be

442
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,820
what they call organized
masculine or organized feminine.

443
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,510
And as I say this,

444
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,210
I want you to try and discard

445
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,950
with the cultural connotations

446
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,760
or your psychological connotations,

447
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,800
of what masculinization
and feminization are.

448
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
Because we're only
centering on the biology.

449
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,160
So typically, people have
either two X chromosomes,

450
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,250
and the traditional language around that

451
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,030
is that person is female, right?

452
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,660
Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome

453
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,940
and that person will become male.

454
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,640
Now it's not always the case.

455
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,350
There are cases where it's XXY,

456
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,080
where there two X chromosomes
plus a Y chromosome.

457
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,620
There are also cases where it's XYY.

458
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,230
Where they're two Y chromosomes.

459
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,560
and these have important biological

460
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,313
and psychological impacts.

461
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,410
So the first thing we
need to establish is that

462
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,170
there is something called chromosomal sex.

463
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,840
Whether or not they're two X chromosomes,

464
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,680
or an X and Y chromosome,

465
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,880
is what we call chromosomal sex.

466
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,140
But the next stage of
separating out the sexes,

467
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,260
is what we call gonadal sex.

468
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,369
Typically not always, but typically

469
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,689
if somebody has testes for their gonads,

470
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,079
we think of them as male.

471
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,959
And if somebody has ovaries,
we think of them as female.

472
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,339
Although that's not
always the case either.

473
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,290
But let's just explore

474
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,040
the transition from
chromosomal sex to gonadal sex,

475
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,840
because it's a fascinating one

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,160
that we all went through
in some form or another.

477
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,540
So this XY that we typically think of as

478
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,023
promoting masculinization of the fetus.

479
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,160
We say that because on the
Y chromosome there are genes

480
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,410
and those genes have particular
functions that suppress

481
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,290
female reproductive organs.

482
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,420
So on the Y chromosome there's a gene,

483
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,450
which encodes for something called

484
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,700
Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone.

485
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,960
So there's actually a hormone

486
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,230
that's programmed by the Y chromosome

487
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,090
that inhibits the formation
of Mullerian Ducts,

488
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,000
which are an important part of the female

489
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,503
reproductive apparatus.

490
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,240
That's critical because,

491
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,070
already we're seeing
the transition between

492
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,190
chromosome Y chromosome and gonad.

493
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,782
And other genes on the Y chromosome

494
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:28,440
promote the formation of testes.

495
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,490
So there are genes like the SRY gene

496
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,040
and other genes that promote
the formation of testes,

497
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,150
while they also inhibit the formation

498
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,410
of the Mullerian Ducts.

499
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,010
So the transition from
chromosomal sex to gonadal sex

500
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,360
is a very important distinction.

501
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,970
It's kind of a fork in the road

502
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,850
that happens very early in development

503
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,500
while fetuses are still in the embryo.

504
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,610
Now what's interesting as well,

505
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,470
is that just because
there's a Y chromosome

506
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,530
that can suppress Mullerian Duct formation

507
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,760
and there are other genes
on the Y chromosome that

508
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,130
promote testes development.

509
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,400
The placenta itself is an endocrine organ.

510
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,520
I think most people don't know this

511
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,530
but the placenta is an
endocrine organ as well.

512
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,250
The mother, which of course
is carrying the fetus

513
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,680
has an adrenal gland which
can produce testosterone.

514
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,200
There are instances for example,

515
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,450
where a mother has either a tumor

516
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,130
or for some other reason is

517
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,740
secreting large levels of testosterone

518
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,630
while carrying a fetus that is XX.

519
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,110
And that leads to what

520
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,690
we would call masculinization

521
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,090
of certain aspects of the fetus.

522
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,810
Typically, that will be enlarged clitoris.

523
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,280
There also some examples

524
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,180
of other phenotypes on
the body that are created

525
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,130
even though it's a purely
XX chromosomal baby.

526
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,120
So we have to distinguish between

527
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,510
chromosomal sex, gonadal sex.

528
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,560
And then there's what
we call hormonal sex.

529
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,200
Which is the effects of
the steroid hormones,

530
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,980
estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives,

531
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,840
on what we call morphological sex

532
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,650
or the shape of the baby and the human

533
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,460
and the genitalia and the jaw

534
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,510
and all these other things.

535
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,820
And so it actually is quite complicated.

536
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,390
So you know, it's a long distance from

537
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,020
chromosomes to gender identity

538
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,350
and gender identity has a lot of

539
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,590
social influences and roles.

540
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,790
This is an area that
right now is very dynamic

541
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,990
and in the discussion
out there as you know.

542
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,020
But just getting from chromosomal sex

543
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,960
to what we would call gonadal sex

544
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,530
and hormonal sex and morphological sex,

545
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,810
involves a number of steps.

546
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,050
So today we're going to
talk about those steps.

547
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,130
And there's some fascinating things that

548
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,530
do indeed relate to tools.

549
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,910
Do indeed relate

550
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,420
to some important behavioral choices.

551
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,210
Important choices about things
to avoid while pregnant.

552
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,980
And for those of you
that are not pregnant,

553
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,850
things to avoid if you're thinking about

554
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,590
eventually having children.

555
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,530
And that is not to drive development

556
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,810
in one direction or another,

557
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,270
but there are examples where

558
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,920
there are some deleterious
things in our environment

559
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,190
that can actually negatively impact

560
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,380
what we call sexual development overall,

561
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,490
regardless of chromosomal background.

562
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,160
So let's get started with that.

563
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,240
Let's talk a little bit
more about what hormones do.

564
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,850
Hormones generally have
two categories of effects.

565
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,540
They can either be very fast
or they can be very slow.

566
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,290
There are hormones like
cortisol and adrenaline,

567
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,850
which act very fast.

568
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,580
Adrenaline can increase your heart rate

569
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,520
very fast when secreted into the body.

570
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,230
Cortisol can be a little bit slower,

571
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,160
but it also can have
some very fast effects.

572
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,550
And then there are hormones like.

573
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,160
Like testosterone and estrogen,

574
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,103
which we refer to as the
sex steroid hormones.

575
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,320
The sex steroid hormones can have

576
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,380
quick effects through signaling.

577
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,030
Meaning they can attach to cells

578
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,020
and make those cells do different things.

579
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,470
They can have a actually quite
quick effects on the brain.

580
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,850
A lot of people don't know this,

581
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,740
but there are some very fast effects of

582
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,759
estrogen and testosterone as
well as long-term effects.

583
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,230
These molecules, for those
of you that are interested,

584
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,560
are what it called lipophilic.

585
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,270
Which just means that
they like fatty stuff,

586
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,180
they can actually pass
through fatty membranes.

587
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,510
And because the outside of cells,

588
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,590
as well as the what's
called the nuclear envelope.

589
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,424
Where all the DNA contents
and stuff are stuffed inside,

590
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,565
are made of lipid, of fat.

591
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:12,120
These steroid hormones can
actually travel into cells

592
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,750
and then get into the DNA.

593
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,930
Basically interact with the DNA of cells

594
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,590
in order to control gene expression.

595
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,010
So they can change

596
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,500
the sorts of things that cells will become

597
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,440
and they can change the
way that cells function

598
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,650
in a long-term way.

599
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,430
And that's actually how

600
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,937
the presence of these genes like SRY

601
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:31,690
and Mullerian inhibiting hormone,

602
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,840
lead to reductions or
elimination I should say,

603
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,460
of things like the Mullerian Ducts

604
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,430
and promote instead what's called in males

605
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,220
the Wolffian Ducts.

606
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,590
Or promote the development of
testes rather than ovaries.

607
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,100
So all you need to know is that

608
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,477
hormones have short-term
and long-term effects.

609
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:50,590
And the long-term effects are actually

610
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,910
related to their effects on genes

611
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,746
and how those genes are
expressed or repressed,

612
00:22:55,746 --> 00:22:58,570
in order to prevent them from having

613
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,310
particular proteins made.

614
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,320
So these hormones,

615
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,310
these steroid hormones
are exceedingly powerful.

616
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,420
And if we're going to
have a discussion about

617
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,000
masculinization or feminization et cetera,

618
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,610
you also need to think
about the counterpart.

619
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,520
It's not just about masculinizing the body

620
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,060
or feminizing the body and brain,

621
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,320
it's also about demasculinize
the brain in many cases,

622
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,365
as a normal biological function

623
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:25,050
of typically of XX females.

624
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,440
And de feminization,

625
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,900
the suppression of certain
pathways that are related

626
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,370
to feminization of the body and brain.

627
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,550
But there are some really
fascinating twists in this story.

628
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,800
So I've just thrown a lot
of biology at you, but

629
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,139
this is where it all starts
to get incredibly surprising.

630
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:47,200
You would think that it's
straightforward, right?

631
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,310
You have a Y chromosome

632
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,430
you suppress the female
reproductive pathway

633
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,700
like the Mullerian Ducts.

634
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,600
You promote the development of testes

635
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,480
and then testes make testosterone.

636
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,377
And then it organizes the brain male

637
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:04,240
and it wants to do male like things.

638
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,557
And then in females you get estrogen

639
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:09,030
and it wants to do female like things.

640
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,270
And air quotes here for all of this.

641
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,490
It turns out that isn't
how it works at all.

642
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,500
Here's where it's interesting.

643
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,930
We have to understand

644
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,680
that there are effects of these hormones,

645
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,690
testosterone and estrogen.

646
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,740
on what are called primary
sexual characteristics.

647
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,540
Which are the ones that you're born with.

648
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
Secondary sexual characteristics,

649
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,270
which are the ones that
show up in puberty.

650
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,080
And these are happening in the brain

651
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,920
and body and spinal cord.

652
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,540
And so I'm going to
disentangle all this for you

653
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,790
by giving you some examples.

654
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,450
First, let's talk about the development of

655
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,150
primary sexual characteristics.

656
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,280
The ones that show up at birth.

657
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,700
And one of the more
dramatic examples of this

658
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,190
comes from the role of testosterone

659
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,310
in creating the external genitalia.

660
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,430
Now you might think it's
just straight forward.

661
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,050
If there's a testes, 'cause
there's a Y chromosome.

662
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,620
You know, you've got a gene that codes for

663
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,680
the development of testes,
you get testosterone

664
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,140
and the penis grows

665
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,530
and the baby is born with a penis.

666
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,580
You know, one of the
first things that happens

667
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,670
when the baby comes out

668
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,737
is they look at the genitalia,

669
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:15,020
and they try and make an
assessment on whether or not

670
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,589
it's a quote boy or it's
a quote girl, right?

671
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:20,077
That's been done for a very very long time

672
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:22,133
throughout human history.

673
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,380
It turns out that it's not
testosterone that's responsible

674
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,650
for the development of the penis

675
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,753
in a baby that has an X
chromosome and a Y chromosome.

676
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,620
It's a different androgen.

677
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,750
Androgen is just a category of hormones

678
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,990
that includes testosterone,

679
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,410
but testosterone is converted in the fetus

680
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,940
to something called dihydrotestosterone.

681
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,380
And that's accomplished through

682
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,960
an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase.

683
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,920
Now dihydrotestosterone
has important effects

684
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,250
later in life too.

685
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,210
We will talk about those.

686
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,880
In fact, if you just want to know,

687
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,170
dihydrotestosterone is what we would call

688
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,630
the dominant androgen in males.

689
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,160
It's responsible for aggression.

690
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,020
It's responsible for a
lot of muscular strength.

691
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,480
It's involved in beard growth
and male pattern baldness.

692
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,870
We're going to talk about all of that.

693
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,410
But dihydrotestosterone
has powerful effects

694
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,380
in determining the genitalia,

695
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,520
while the baby is still in the embryo.

696
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,370
So this ends.

697
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,693
There's testosterone that's made.

698
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,130
And that testosterone gets converted

699
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,660
by this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase

700
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,970
in a little structure called the tubercle.

701
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,970
That tubercle will
eventually become the penis.

702
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,710
So you say, "Okay, straight forward."

703
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,750
This testosterone is converted
to dihydrotestosterone.

704
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,990
And then if there's dihydrotestosterone

705
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,640
it controls penis growth.

706
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,620
And indeed that's the case.

707
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,160
So that's a primary sexual characteristic.

708
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,160
That baby will then grow
up and later during puberty

709
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,080
there will be the release of a molecule.

710
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,600
I talked about this last
episode called Kisspeptin.

711
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,180
K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N kisspeptin,

712
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,303
which will cause the release
of some other hormones

713
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:08,050
Connatural releasing
hormone, Luteinizing hormone

714
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,100
will stimulate the testes
to make testosterone.

715
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,320
So in puberty, testosterone
leads to further

716
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,210
growth and development of the penis,

717
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,362
as well as the accumulation
of or growth of pubic hair,

718
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:20,960
a deepening of the voice,

719
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,320
all the secondary sexual
characteristics, okay?

720
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,450
So dihydrotestosterone
creates what we would call

721
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,493
the typical masculine phenotype for

722
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:36,200
primary sexual
characteristics and produces.

723
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,970
Testosterone excuse me, produces

724
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,433
secondary sexual
characteristics during puberty.

725
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,700
There's a very interesting phenomenon

726
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,840
that was published in The
Journal of Science in the 1970s,

727
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,210
for which now there's a
wealth of scientific data.

728
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,090
And this relates to a genetic mutation,

729
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,960
where 5-alpha-reductase
the enzyme that converts

730
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,620
testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist.

731
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,200
It's mutated in a way into a
genome that it doesn't exist.

732
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,440
And this actually was first identified

733
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,960
in the Dominican Republic.

734
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,020
It has shown up elsewhere.

735
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,493
It's quite rare, but where
it shows up it's robust.

736
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,330
What happens is baby is born.

737
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,110
Typically when a baby is born

738
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,650
they don't measure chromosomes.

739
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,000
They don't look at
chromosomal sex XX or XY.

740
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,270
That's not typically done nowadays.

741
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,490
Baby is born.

742
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,970
If you were to look at that baby,

743
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,120
it would look female.

744
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,340
There would be very little
or no external penis.

745
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,810
And so people would say, "It's a girl."

746
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,643
And they might, you know,

747
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:38,210
have the celebration it's a girl.

748
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,810
And I guess now they call
them "Gender Reveal Parties"

749
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,643
or something like that.

750
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't know about this, but anyway.

751
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,730
They would reveal.

752
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,730
The baby would reveal
its external genitalia

753
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,230
simply by being there and
being naked when it's born.

754
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,670
It has nothing to do with gender,

755
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,840
it has to do with genitalia and sex.

756
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,610
That baby would be born.

757
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,800
And what was observed is that,

758
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,950
from time to time,

759
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,060
that baby after being raised as a girl,

760
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,120
perfectly happy as a girl

761
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,830
would around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,

762
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,580
would suddenly start to sprout a penis.

763
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,730
There's actually a name for this,

764
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,280
it's called Guevedoces.

765
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,090
Which the translation is
more or less, penis at 12.

766
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,680
And as strange as this might sound,

767
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,580
it makes sense if you understand
the underlying mutation.

768
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,680
What happens in these
children, these Guevedoces,

769
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,510
is that the child is born.

770
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,510
It has testes which are not descended,

771
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,140
so up in the body.

772
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,140
They're not making a lot
of testosterone early on.

773
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,350
They weren't able to

774
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,740
convert testosterone
to dihydrotestosterone

775
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,527
because they lack this
enzyme 5-alpha-reductase.

776
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,670
As a consequence,

777
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,470
the primary sexual characteristic

778
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,750
of external male genitalia, penis,

779
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,520
doesn't develop.

780
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,210
And then what happens is

781
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,250
the baby grows up as a
young child essentially

782
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,810
is treated as a girl.

783
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,900
Generally they report being
pretty comfortable as girls,

784
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,350
although not always.

785
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,750
And then testosterone
starts getting secreted

786
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,480
from the testes 'cause
kisspeptin in the brain

787
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,810
signals through gonadotropin
and luteinizing hormone

788
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,060
and travels down to the testes,

789
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,170
the testes start churning out testosterone

790
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,580
and there's a secondary
growth of the penis.

791
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,820
And all of a sudden there's a penis.

792
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,670
And this leads to some
very complicated situations

793
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,192
in families and culturally.

794
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:34,010
And actually the outcomes
in terms of whether or not

795
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,720
these children decide to self
identify as males or females

796
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,800
and how people treat them

797
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
actually varies quite a lot.

798
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,237
There's actually been kind of an

799
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:46,032
adopting of a third
category of sex and gender

800
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:47,745
in these Guevedoces for

801
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:52,210
in order to just offer
them the opportunity to

802
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,410
explore not just what
would be a typical kind of

803
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,380
girl or woman or boy or man phenotype,

804
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,520
but something in between.

805
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,710
Something that some people
call intersex although

806
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,740
intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism

807
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,860
is actually a separate thing altogether.

808
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,340
So it's fascinating and the point here

809
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,990
is that dihydrotestosterone
not testosterone

810
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,930
is responsible for this
primary growth of the penis.

811
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,442
And that testosterone later is involved in

812
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:21,460
the secondary sexual characteristics

813
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,970
deepening in the voice, et cetera.

814
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,200
Now this is where the information

815
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,210
gets even more interesting

816
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,960
and applies to essentially everybody.

817
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,790
You might think

818
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,440
that testosterone because
it masculinizes the body

819
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,373
in the secondary sexual
characteristic way.

820
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,360
And because dihydrotestosterone
another androgen,

821
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,840
masculinizes the primary
sexual characteristics.

822
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,450
The growth of the penis early on,

823
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,900
that testosterone must
masculinize the brain.

824
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,340
And there are in fact aspects of

825
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,070
masculinization of the brain and body,

826
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,740
that are independent of genitalia.

827
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,970
Now it might be obvious to some of you,

828
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,910
but some people probably
don't realize that.

829
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,910
Yes indeed the brain has
receptors for testosterone.

830
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,173
It also has receptors for estrogen.

831
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,730
But the fascinating thing is that

832
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,120
if you look at the brains of

833
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,670
people that have Y chromosomes
and that have testes

834
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,210
and that make testosterone,

835
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,120
and you look at the brains of people

836
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,800
that don't have Y chromosomes or testes

837
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,393
and therefore make far less
testosterone in general,

838
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:39,130
what you realize is that
the cells in the brain

839
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,060
that differ between what
I'll call males and females,

840
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,540
but between XY, and XX

841
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,920
have receptors for testosterone,

842
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,480
but the masculinization of the brain

843
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,760
is not accomplished by testosterone.

844
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,593
I want to repeat this.

845
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,400
The masculinization of the brain

846
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,820
is not accomplished by testosterone.

847
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,913
It is accomplished by estrogen.

848
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,980
Testosterone can be
converted into estrogen

849
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,710
by an enzyme called aromatase.

850
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,470
This is vitally important to understand.

851
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,590
Testosterone can be
converted into estrogen

852
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,560
by something called aromatase.

853
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,910
I'll give an example of where this happens

854
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,090
later in life,

855
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,570
to just illustrate the principle

856
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,220
and really embed it in your mind.

857
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,660
During puberty in boys,
XY chromosome individuals.

858
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,760
It's not uncommon for there to be

859
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,600
transient or sometimes long
lasting breast bud development.

860
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,870
Testosterone goes up during puberty,

861
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,280
for the reasons we talked about before.

862
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,090
And some of that testosterone
gets converted into estrogen

863
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,030
by an enzyme called aromatase.

864
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,310
Aromatase is made by
several sources in the body.

865
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,930
One of the main sources is body fat.

866
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,690
So it can make a lot of aromatase.

867
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,420
Sometimes you'll even see

868
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,570
fairly dramatic breast development
in males during puberty.

869
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,630
Sometimes it's transient,
sometimes it's not.

870
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,110
The other place where you see this

871
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,870
is in athletes and bodybuilders

872
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,960
that take a lot of anabolic steroids.

873
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,290
That take high levels of androgens.

874
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,080
So they'll be taking testosterone

875
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,823
at super physiological doses.

876
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,060
Sometimes not always.

877
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,860
They will convert some of that
testosterone into estrogen

878
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,139
and they'll get what's
called gynecomastia.

879
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,149
Which is the development
of male breast tissue.

880
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,510
Sometimes they'll get
it cut out surgically.

881
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,920
Other times they'll start trying to take

882
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,469
estrogen blockers in order
to try and suppress it

883
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,229
or they'll try and block prolactin.

884
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,610
It's a topic that we're going
to get into in more detail.

885
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,030
But what's important here
is to understand that

886
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,110
testosterone can be converted
to estrogen by aromatase.

887
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,600
Aromatase is not just made in body fat.

888
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,929
There are neurons in the
brain that make aromatase

889
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,339
and convert testosterone into estrogen.

890
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:52,340
And it is testosterone
converted into estrogen.

891
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,213
In other words,

892
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:56,333
it's estrogen that
masculinizes XY individual.

893
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,110
That masculinizes the brain.

894
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,590
And this has profound effects
on all sorts of things.

895
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,840
On behavior, on outlook
in the world et cetera.

896
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,220
But I think most people don't realize

897
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,130
that it's estrogen that
comes from testosterone

898
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,450
that masculinizes the
male brain, the XY brain.

899
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,300
Not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.

900
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,380
So I just want to mention some tools.

901
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,587
You might be asking yourself,

902
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,570
"How could tools possibly come up

903
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,010
at this stage of the conversation

904
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,270
where we're talking
about sexual development

905
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,380
and we're talking about

906
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,590
the differentiation of
tissues in the body."

907
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,260
Well, this is true both for children

908
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,920
and parents and adults.

909
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,240
I want to emphasize that

910
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,870
there are things that are environmental

911
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,320
and there are things that people use

912
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,760
in their homes sometimes
that actually can impact

913
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,570
hormone levels and can impact

914
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,830
sexual development in
fairly profound ways.

915
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,670
And I want to be very clear,

916
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,550
this is not me pulling from

917
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,690
some rare journal have never heard of it.

918
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,930
This is pulling from textbooks.

919
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,440
In particular, today I'm guiding
a lot of the conversation

920
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,580
on work that on
"Behavioral Endocrinology,"

921
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,273
is a book by Randy Nelson
and Lance Kriegsfeld.

922
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,100
True experts in the field.

923
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,170
I'm going to talk about some
of the work from Tyrone Hayes

924
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,270
from UC Berkeley

925
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,000
about environmental toxins
and their impacts on

926
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,860
some of these things like
testosterone and estrogen.

927
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,770
I'm going to touch into them.

928
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,370
I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence

929
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,770
that's grounded in studies,

930
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,610
which we will provide in the caption

931
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,360
or that I'll reference here.

932
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,800
One of those that's
actually really interesting

933
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,780
but helps illustrate the principle

934
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,070
that we've been talking about is.

935
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,180
A few years ago, there
was a lot of excitement

936
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,000
about Evening Primrose Oil.

937
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,490
Evening Primrose Oil
is in a lot of products

938
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,810
that typically are associated

939
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,760
with skin beauty and skin health.

940
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,080
And so I'm generalizing here.

941
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,400
But typically it was mothers
or sisters that were using it.

942
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,200
And there were actually
examples starting to crop up

943
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,080
of young boys getting

944
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,490
accelerated breast bud development

945
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,110
from skin contact with women were using

946
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,370
Evening Primrose Oil.

947
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,328
So Evening Primrose Oil is

948
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,640
chemically a lot like estrogen

949
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,890
and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds.

950
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,610
There are a number of
things out there like this.

951
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,880
So believe it or not
things like pine pollen

952
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,430
look very much like
testosterone structurally.

953
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,800
They are more or less are testosterone.

954
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,580
Their bioavailability in
humans isn't as clear.

955
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,458
Evening Primrose Oil
has a lot of estrogenic

956
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,940
elements to it.

957
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,600
Just structurally how it's built.

958
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,370
And so there were cases where boys were

959
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,320
understandably you know,

960
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,390
being hugged by their mom

961
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,399
or maybe even like showering and taking.

962
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,780
you know using the Evening
Primrose Oil solution.

963
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,440
Those things will actually
change levels of estrogens

964
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,820
in boys and girls.

965
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,920
And so this wasn't just
an issue for young boys.

966
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,350
This is also an issue for young girls.

967
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,740
So it's not that Evening
Primrose Oil is bad,

968
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,090
it's just that many of
you have probably heard

969
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,390
about the dangers of Soy Isoflavones

970
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,780
and things like that.

971
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,725
The impact of soy on estrogen levels is,

972
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:07,420
there are some decent
evidence to support that.

973
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,630
However, there's a lot of other factors

974
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,530
that are more severe.

975
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,140
And one of those is this
Evening Primrose Oil.

976
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,664
So regardless of age,

977
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:16,450
let's just put it this way

978
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,520
because people might be
wanting to drive their

979
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,768
hormones more estrogenic
or more androgenic.

980
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:24,390
How could I know which
what your preference is?

981
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,270
I don't know.

982
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,518
But in any case,

983
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:30,174
things like pre Evening
Primrose Oil can actually

984
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,277
promote estrogenic pathways in the body

985
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,210
and some of it can go transdermal.

986
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,720
Likewise, because testosterone
replacement therapy

987
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,540
is fairly widespread nowadays.

988
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,510
And some people accomplish
that through cream.

989
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,780
It's pretty well understood that,

990
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,600
if someone's taking that
they want to avoid contact

991
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,724
with anyone.

992
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:52,134
Skin contact with anyone
that is trying to promote

993
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:55,493
more estrogenic activity in their body.

994
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,690
And especially in children.

995
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,570
So that's one.

996
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,280
The other is this issue
of environmental factors.

997
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,430
Now this, you know,

998
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,070
again I'm just going to highlight,

999
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,760
when one starts talking
about environmental factors

1000
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,260
and how they're poisoning
us or disrupting growth

1001
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,650
or fertility rates

1002
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,930
it can start to sound a little bit crazy.

1003
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,720
Except when you start to actually look at

1004
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,120
some of the real data,

1005
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,270
Data from quality research labs funded by

1006
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,600
Federal government funded,

1007
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,810
not from companies or other sources,

1008
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,150
that are really aimed at understanding

1009
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,810
what the underlying biology is.

1010
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,023
And for that I really,

1011
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:33,330
we should all be grateful to
Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley.

1012
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,830
I remember way back when
I was a graduate student

1013
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,810
in the late nineties,
goodness. at UC Berkeley.

1014
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,020
And I remember him, he was studying frogs.

1015
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,020
He was talking about developmental
defects in these frogs

1016
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,960
that live in different waters around

1017
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,058
it was California, but also elsewhere.

1018
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:52,340
And he identified a substance,

1019
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,690
which is present in a lot of waterways

1020
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,610
throughout this country
and other countries.

1021
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,400
So US and beyond.

1022
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,440
Certainly not just
restricted to California,

1023
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,840
which is atrazine.

1024
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,900
This is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.

1025
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,580
Again, this is the stuff of textbooks.

1026
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,290
And it causes severe
testicular malformations.

1027
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,440
So again, atrazine exposure is serious.

1028
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,833
And what's interesting is
if you look at the data,

1029
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,220
what you find is that

1030
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,610
at sites in Western
and Midwestern sections

1031
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:25,280
of the United States 10
to 92% of male frogs.

1032
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,160
These were frogs mind you,

1033
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,170
had testicular abnormalities.

1034
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,023
And the most severe
testicular malformations

1035
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:35,070
were in the testes
rather than in the sperm.

1036
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,980
So it's actually the organ
itself, the gonad itself.

1037
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,900
Now it's very well known now

1038
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,420
that atrazine is in many herbicides.

1039
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,840
And so you know, whereas I would say in

1040
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,720
the 80's and 90's the discussion around

1041
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,350
herbicides and their negative effects

1042
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,535
was considered kind of
like hippy-dippy stuff

1043
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,160
or the stuff you hear about at

1044
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,780
you know, your local community markets

1045
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,560
and these kind of new age communities.

1046
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,830
Now there's very solid data,

1047
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,930
from Federally funded
labs at major universities

1048
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,390
that have been peer reviewed and published

1049
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,040
in excellent journals,

1050
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,250
showing that indeed
many of these herbicides

1051
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,080
can have negative effects,

1052
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,730
primarily by impacting the
ratios of these hormones

1053
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,147
in either the mothers or in the testes,

1054
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,620
altering the testes of the fathers

1055
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,300
or direct effects on
developing young animals

1056
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,133
and potentially humans.

1057
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,190
And so you ask, "Well, what about humans?

1058
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,180
Frogs are wonderful,
but what about humans?"

1059
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,338
So here are the data on what's happening

1060
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:41,420
and this isn't all
going to be scary stuff.

1061
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,670
We're also going to talk about

1062
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,740
tools to ameliorate and
offset some of these effects.

1063
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,573
One would be,

1064
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:47,730
be cautious with Evening Primrose

1065
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,230
as well as testosterone creams,

1066
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,190
depending on whether or
not you want to be more

1067
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,550
androgenic or estrogenic

1068
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,000
depending on your needs.

1069
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,110
But across human populations,

1070
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,750
sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?

1071
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,523
So in 1940, the average,

1072
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,860
the average density of human sperm was

1073
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,770
113 million per milliliter of semen.

1074
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,603
That's how it's measured.

1075
00:42:09,603 --> 00:42:11,910
How many sperm per milliliter of semen.

1076
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,419
In 1990 this figure has dropped to 66.

1077
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:18,510
So it went from 113 million per milliliter

1078
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,580
to 66 million per milliliter

1079
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,690
in the United States and Western Europe.

1080
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,170
So this is not just a US thing.

1081
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,940
Researchers also estimated that

1082
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,640
the volume of semen produced by men

1083
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,720
has dropped 20% in that time,

1084
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,372
reduced sperm count per
generation even further.

1085
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:35,960
So between 1981 and 1991,

1086
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,730
the ratio of normal spermatogenesis

1087
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,900
has decreased from 56.4% to 26.9%.

1088
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,790
So there's a lot that's happening

1089
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,550
primarily because of these herbicides

1090
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,370
that are in widespread use
to reduce sperm counts.

1091
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,260
And these are going to
have profound effects

1092
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,340
not just on sperm counts,

1093
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,210
but on development,

1094
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,810
sexual development at the level of

1095
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,210
the gonads and the brain.

1096
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,270
Because you need testosterone to get

1097
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,010
dihydrotestosterone for
primary sexual characteristics.

1098
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,870
You need estrogen that's
come from testosterone

1099
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,050
to masculinize the brain.

1100
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,480
And of course,

1101
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,550
we're not just focusing
on sperm and testosterone.

1102
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,070
You of course also know

1103
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,450
that many of these
herbicides are disrupting

1104
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,780
estrogens in a similar way.

1105
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,080
Or are leading to hyper
estrogenic, excuse me,

1106
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,769
states which might explain why

1107
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:31,100
puberty is happening so much earlier

1108
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,470
in young girls these days.

1109
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,270
So there are a lot of
things that are happening.

1110
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,520
Now does this mean that
you have to run around

1111
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,230
and neurotically avoid
anything that includes

1112
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,560
things like atrazine and
should you be avoiding

1113
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,180
all kinds of herbicides?

1114
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,860
I don't know that's up to you.

1115
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,040
But it does seem that these
have pretty marked effects,

1116
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,330
in both the animal studies
and in the human studies.

1117
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,460
You know, you can open up a textbook like

1118
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,760
the endocrinology textbook

1119
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,870
and find things like Vinclozolin.

1120
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,880
V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N,

1121
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,900
which is a fungicide and
it's an anti-androgen.

1122
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,710
You give it to animals, to rats.

1123
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,170
And instead of forming a
penis, they don't form a penis.

1124
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,230
They basically, it's not
that they form a clitoris,

1125
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,740
they just don't form a penis.

1126
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,990
So let's talk about
female sexual development.

1127
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,280
And as always what we'll do is,

1128
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,690
we'll talk about the normal biology.

1129
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,010
Then we'll talk a little bit about

1130
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,820
a kind of extraordinary
or unusual set of cases,

1131
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,080
but we'll talk about them because

1132
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,740
they illustrate an important principle

1133
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,700
about how things work under
typical circumstances.

1134
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,530
So there is a mutation called

1135
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,960
androgen insensitivity syndrome.

1136
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,030
And understanding how androgen
insensitivity syndrome works

1137
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,580
can help you really
understand how hormones

1138
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,800
impact sexual development.

1139
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,500
So here's how it works.

1140
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,413
There are individuals who are XY,

1141
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,480
so they have a Y chromosome,

1142
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,310
that are born that make testosterone.

1143
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:10,363
They have testes and they
don't have Mullerian Ducts

1144
00:45:10,363 --> 00:45:12,510
because on the Y chromosome is this

1145
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,400
Mullerian inhibiting hormone.

1146
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,600
However, these individuals
look completely female.

1147
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,720
And in general, they report feeling

1148
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,040
like girls when they're young,

1149
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,290
women when they're older.

1150
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,060
But there's something unusual

1151
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,880
that's happening in these individuals

1152
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,880
because they have an XY
chromosomal type and not XX.

1153
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,580
So what's happening?

1154
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,670
Well what's happening is

1155
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,970
the testes are making testosterone,

1156
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,410
but the receptor for
testosterone is mutated.

1157
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,750
And therefore the testes never descend.

1158
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,140
They don't have ovaries, they have testes

1159
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,000
but the testes are internal.

1160
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,970
And so typically these
individuals find out

1161
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,930
that they are actually XY chromosomes.

1162
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,930
so that you know, their
chromosomal sex is male.

1163
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,900
If you will.

1164
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,630
And their gonadal sex is male,

1165
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,010
but the gonads, the testes
are inside the body.

1166
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,980
They don't actually develop a scrotum.

1167
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,050
They don't make ovaries.

1168
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,220
And when they don't menstruate
around the time of puberty

1169
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,200
that's a sign that something is different.

1170
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,990
And so they never
menstruate around puberty.

1171
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,340
And if they look into this deeply enough,

1172
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,400
what you find is that
they are actually XY.

1173
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,410
They make testosterone

1174
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,450
but their body can't make
use of the testosterone

1175
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,920
because they don't have the receptors.

1176
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,320
And the receptors are
vitally important for some,

1177
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,180
for most all of the secondary
sexual characteristics

1178
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,060
that we talked about.

1179
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,930
Body hair, penis growth
during puberty et cetera.

1180
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,160
They live fairly happy lives as females.

1181
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,100
Although of course they
can't conceive, right?

1182
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,978
They don't have a uterus,
they don't have ovaries.

1183
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,296
They also in general, don't produce sperm

1184
00:46:50,296 --> 00:46:53,040
in quantities enough
that they could actually

1185
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,070
reproduce with somebody else,

1186
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,610
although sometimes they can.

1187
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,180
And believe it or not,

1188
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,350
and I'm not going to name names

1189
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,430
but there are actually
reports of several people,

1190
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,560
fairly prominent people throughout history

1191
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,250
who have had this androgen
insensitivity syndrome

1192
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,890
or people suspected they did.

1193
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,100
And the reason to not name names is that,

1194
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,790
it gets right to the
heart of whether or not

1195
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,230
they are male or female.

1196
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,610
How could you say right?

1197
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,400
They have XY chromosomes

1198
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,440
but gonadally they have
testes that are inside.

1199
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,800
And yet, if you looked at their bodies

1200
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,720
if you looked at their faces,

1201
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,710
you would say almost with certainty

1202
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,790
that they appeared female.

1203
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:35,283
And that naturally occurring experiment,

1204
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,731
points to the fact that

1205
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:40,100
testosterone that shows up in the body

1206
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,840
and impacts the things that
the levels of the receptor

1207
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,780
has a profound effect on phenotype.

1208
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,980
On the external or body plan.

1209
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,740
So again, we're talking about this

1210
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,210
in order to illustrate the principle that

1211
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,160
in order to have its effects,

1212
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,600
a hormone doesn't just have to be present.

1213
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,880
That hormone actually has to
be able to bind its receptor

1214
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,970
and take action on the target cells.

1215
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,120
And once again, I'll just
throw out the example of

1216
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,090
where people are using
performance enhancing drugs.

1217
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,740
Although that's a pretty broad statement,

1218
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,360
nowadays there's a lot of excitement about

1219
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,800
the so-called SARMs.

1220
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,180
Who are more on the receptor side.

1221
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,527
And so we'll talk about
this in a future episode.

1222
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:21,070
And I just say that as a teaser because

1223
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,030
the SARMs and what's happening right now

1224
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,200
in augmenting sports performance,

1225
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,710
both with testosterone directly

1226
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,160
but also testosterone derivatives

1227
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,900
and then also altering things at

1228
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,820
the level of the receptor
is exceedingly interesting

1229
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,730
and is revealing to us
the many ways in which

1230
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,773
hormones can impact brain and body.

1231
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,570
In ways that we didn't suspect.

1232
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,030
Perhaps the simplest way to understand

1233
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,150
how estrogen and testosterone impact

1234
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,740
masculinization or feminization
of the brain and behavior

1235
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,670
is from a statement.

1236
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,060
It's actually the closing
sentence of an abstract

1237
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,500
that my colleague Neuronal Shaw

1238
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,000
at Stanford school of medicine published.

1239
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,540
Which is that estrogen,

1240
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,920
again it's estrogen that is
aromatized from testosterone

1241
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,670
by aromatase,

1242
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,190
sets up the masculine
repertoire of sexual,

1243
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,630
and in animals and in humans,
territorial behaviors.

1244
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,950
So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.

1245
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,450
Estrogen does that.

1246
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,640
Estrogen sets up the masculine
circuitry in the brain

1247
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,833
and testosterone is then what controls

1248
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:30,920
the display of those
behaviors later in life.

1249
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,060
And I find that incredibly interesting.

1250
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,560
You would think it was just testosterone

1251
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,470
did one thing and estrogen did another,

1252
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,400
but it turns out that nature is

1253
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,380
far more interesting than that.

1254
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,180
Okay, so what are some things
that impact sexual development

1255
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,733
early in life and later in life.

1256
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,360
Let's talk about cannabis.

1257
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,610
Let's talk about alcohol

1258
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:56,740
and dare I say let's
talk about cell phones.

1259
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,430
Something that I never
thought I would ever do,

1260
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,290
either in this podcast
or in the classroom.

1261
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,720
But, these days there are
really interesting data.

1262
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,380
And I think you should be aware of them.

1263
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,450
First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.

1264
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,670
I realize that there are
now a lot of different

1265
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,760
variance it's on this.

1266
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,570
There are a lot of different
strains of cannabis.

1267
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,010
I personally am not a pot smoker.

1268
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,100
It's just not for me.

1269
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,850
I'm not talking about the
moral or legal implications,

1270
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:27,550
in some States it's decriminalized,

1271
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,190
in other places it's really illegal

1272
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,313
and other places it's basically legal.

1273
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,720
You have to check,

1274
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,940
you know where you live
and understand the laws.

1275
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,700
That's not what this is about.

1276
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,800
What we do know however,

1277
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,822
is that with the exception of one study

1278
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:46,820
there are many studies
that point to the fact

1279
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,110
that THC and other things in cannabis

1280
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,110
promote significant increases
in aromatase activity.

1281
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,690
Now pot smokers aren't going to like this,

1282
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,890
especially male pot smokers
aren't going to like this

1283
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,190
but it's the reality.

1284
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,010
Remember, what you're
hearing in the background

1285
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,760
is Costello snoring really loud?

1286
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,910
Should we put them on screen?

1287
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,890
He's not a cannabis smoker,
but you can imagine why.

1288
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,370
Come here Costello.

1289
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,340
Come here buddy, come here.

1290
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,173
He's asleep.

1291
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:15,130
Come here.

1292
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,880
He's my [indistinct], there you go.

1293
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,870
This dog definitely
does not need cannabis.

1294
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,470
This is his state for most of the time.

1295
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,600
He is highly...

1296
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,650
Oh he's asleep still.

1297
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,170
So some of you have asked to see Costello

1298
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,510
if you're just listening on audio,

1299
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:32,673
maybe he'll gives a

1300
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,410
[Costello grunts]
Oh, okay.

1301
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,320
We're going to let him get back to sleep.

1302
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,153
He's always here,

1303
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:39,090
some of you have asked to see him.

1304
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,943
Costello's not a pot smoker either.

1305
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,000
He did have a dog sitter that

1306
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:47,910
was a pot smoker years ago.

1307
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,520
It was his favorite dog sitter but,

1308
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,020
I'm not a pot smoker.

1309
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,040
Again, no judgment.

1310
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,020
But here's the deal.

1311
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,450
That cannabis,

1312
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,010
and it's not clear if it's THC itself

1313
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,790
or other elements in the marijuana plant,

1314
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,900
promote aromatase activity.

1315
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,520
Now, this has been observed anecdotally

1316
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,030
where pot smokers have a
higher incidence of developing

1317
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,000
something I mentioned before gynecomastia,

1318
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,960
breast bud development.

1319
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,560
Or full-blown breast development in males.

1320
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,530
There may be some women
who want to increase

1321
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,110
their estrogenic activity.

1322
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,080
Remember females make testosterone.

1323
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,990
It comes from the adrenals, right?

1324
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,120
They don't have testes.

1325
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,930
So it comes from the adrenals

1326
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,470
and that testosterone
can also be aromatized.

1327
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,610
Although typically

1328
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,250
most of the aromatase activity
that we're referring to

1329
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,830
in these examples is in males.

1330
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:42,990
So testosterone can increase
estrogenic activity.

1331
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,820
So you might say, "Oh you know, therefore

1332
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:49,330
does testosterone reduce sexual behavior?

1333
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,620
Does it create all sorts of things

1334
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,010
that are related to low testosterone?"

1335
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,130
Not necessarily, not necessarily.

1336
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,093
And here's why,

1337
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:03,640
estrogen itself in males and females

1338
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,213
is important for things like
libido and sexual behavior.

1339
00:53:08,213 --> 00:53:10,160
I'm going to repeat that.

1340
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
If estrogen is too low in males,

1341
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,850
it can actually inhibit
libido and sexual behavior.

1342
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:19,780
So you don't want estrogen
too high or too low.

1343
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,690
Whether or not you're male or female.

1344
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,570
Now of course in females,

1345
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,960
estrogen levels tend to
be higher than in males.

1346
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,630
I'm speaking very generally here.

1347
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,470
You just think back to
the chromosomal sex.

1348
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,350
That's what I'm referring to

1349
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,310
when I say male or female,

1350
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:35,590
although there's nuance there of course.

1351
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:39,950
In females, the testosterone
that comes from the adrenals

1352
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,690
has a powerful effect on
libido and desire to reproduce.

1353
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,580
And in the next episode,

1354
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,270
we're going to talk about how that works

1355
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:48,890
and its relationship to birth control,

1356
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,540
its relationship to menopause.

1357
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,900
We're also going to talk about how that

1358
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,490
whole thing works in males as well.

1359
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:59,430
But cannabis and other
aspects of the marijuana plant

1360
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,820
can impact levels of
testosterone and estrogen

1361
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,260
by increasing aromatase.

1362
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,830
And so people should be aware of that.

1363
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,550
As well, there are good data.

1364
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,500
I was able to find
several studies on PubMed,

1365
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,270
pointing to the fact that

1366
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,110
smoking marijuana during pregnancy can

1367
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:20,290
shift the pattern of hormones
in the developing fetus,

1368
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:24,060
such that it promotes
more estrogenic outcomes.

1369
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,350
Now earlier I said that

1370
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,930
estrogen is what masculinized
is the male brain,

1371
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,530
in utero that's true,

1372
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,460
but the way that cannabis seems to work,

1373
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,900
at least from the studies I
was able to identify is that

1374
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,530
it promotes circulating
estrogen in the body

1375
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,500
and therefore can counteract

1376
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,222
some of the masculinizing effects of

1377
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:46,970
things like testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone,

1378
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,710
on primary and secondary
sexual characteristics.

1379
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,083
So I mention this because,

1380
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,540
you know I think nowadays marijuana use

1381
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,010
is far more widespread

1382
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,516
and certainly during puberty

1383
00:54:57,516 --> 00:55:01,030
it can have profound effects
on these hormonal systems.

1384
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,040
And so we'll do another episode,

1385
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,230
that goes really deep into this.

1386
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,580
But yes, cannabis promotes
estrogenic activity

1387
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,960
by increasing aromatase.

1388
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,760
Almost everyone can appreciate that

1389
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,290
drinking during pregnancy,

1390
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,140
is not good for the developing fetus.

1391
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,570
Fetal alcohol syndrome
is a well-established

1392
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,280
negative outcome of pregnancy.

1393
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,720
And it's something that

1394
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,780
there are cognitive effects
that are really bad.

1395
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,070
There's actually physical
malformation, et cetera.

1396
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,740
So drinking during pregnancy, not good.

1397
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,940
Probably drinking during
puberty, not good either.

1398
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,300
Because alcohol, in particular
certain things like beer

1399
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,300
but other grain alcohols can
increase estrogenic activity.

1400
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,441
Now, this isn't just about protecting

1401
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:51,530
young boys from estrogenic activity.

1402
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,870
It's also protecting girls from

1403
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:59,870
excessive or even hypo
estrogenic effects of alcohol

1404
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,040
in puberty.

1405
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,720
Now, many teenagers drink.

1406
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,950
College students drink

1407
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:07,370
and it's important to point out that

1408
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,010
puberty doesn't start on one
day and end on another day,

1409
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,320
puberty has a beginning
a middle and an end,

1410
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,120
but development is really
our entire lifespan.

1411
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,240
This idea that you know,

1412
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,120
puberty you know has this open and close.

1413
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,530
That's just false.

1414
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,130
Okay, so we talked about cannabis.

1415
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,900
We talked about alcohol.

1416
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,910
Let's talk about cell phones.

1417
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,890
First of all, I use a cell phone.

1418
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,270
I use it very often.

1419
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,420
And I do not think they are evil devices.

1420
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,960
I think that they require some discipline

1421
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,040
in order to make sure that

1422
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,260
it does not become a
negative force in one's life.

1423
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,270
So I personally restrict
the number of hours

1424
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,060
that I'm on the phone and in
particular on social media.

1425
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,910
I only answer email at
particular times of day.

1426
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,940
But what about the cell phone itself?

1427
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,220
You know, when I was a junior professor.

1428
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,020
I was a pre-tenure early professor.

1429
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,660
I taught this class on

1430
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,730
neural circuits in health and disease.

1431
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,420
And one of the students asked me,

1432
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,180
you know are cell phones
safe for the brain?

1433
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,340
And you know, all the data

1434
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,890
point to the fact that they were.

1435
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,030
Or at least there were no
data showing that it wasn't.

1436
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,820
I still don't have the
answer on that, frankly.

1437
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,230
I don't see a lot of studies about it.

1438
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,480
I'm not personally aware of any evidence

1439
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,250
in quality peer reviewed studies

1440
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,560
showing that cell phones
are bad for the brain

1441
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,560
or that holding the
phone to the ear is bad

1442
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,390
or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that.

1443
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,380
I'm just not aware of any quality studies.

1444
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,410
If you are aware of quality
studies, peer reviewed study

1445
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:36,620
please reference them, put
them in the comment section.

1446
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,610
Send them to me, however you like.

1447
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,820
I'd love to see them.

1448
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,680
I'm not aware of them.

1449
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,340
However, I was very interested

1450
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,720
in a particular study

1451
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,610
that was published back in 2013 on rats.

1452
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,240
It was basically took a cell phone

1453
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,850
and put it under a cage of rats

1454
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,220
and looked at basically testicular

1455
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,950
and ovarian development in rats and saw

1456
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:03,960
minor but still statistically
significant defects

1457
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,690
in ovarian and testicular development.

1458
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,113
Since then and now
returning to the literature,

1459
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:16,060
I've seen a absolute explosion of studies.

1460
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,310
Some of which are in quality journals,

1461
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,950
some of which are in what I would call

1462
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,603
not to blue ribbon journals.

1463
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,440
Identifying defects in testicular
and or ovarian development

1464
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,950
by mere exposure to cell
phone emitted waves.

1465
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,033
Let's just call that,

1466
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,030
we don't know what they are.

1467
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:37,560
And this sounds almost crazy, right?

1468
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,187
Anytime somebody starts talking about

1469
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:40,020
EMS and things like that,

1470
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,920
you kind of worry like,
is this person okay?

1471
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,770
But look, the literature are
pointing in a direction where

1472
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:49,270
chronic exposure of the gonads

1473
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:52,480
to cell phones could be
creating serious issues

1474
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,550
in terms of the health
at the cellular level

1475
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:56,900
and then in terms of the output.

1476
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,940
So the output for the testes
would be sperm production.

1477
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,350
Swimming speed in sperm

1478
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,810
is an important feature of sperm health.

1479
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,343
In the ovaries it would
be estrogenic output.

1480
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:11,010
How regular the cycles are.

1481
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,843
So in animals,

1482
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:14,060
the cycles are a little bit
different than in humans.

1483
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,190
They don't have a menstrual cycle.

1484
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,610
They have an estrous cycle,

1485
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,510
which is a generally around four days.

1486
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:23,460
I think that it's to say
based on the literature,

1487
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:28,000
that there are effects of
cell phone emitted waves

1488
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,630
on gonadal development.

1489
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,070
The question is,

1490
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,840
what is the proximity of the
cell phone to the gonads?

1491
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,050
Now, I've taken the
literature as I observe it.

1492
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,970
And that of course we'll
point you to in the captions.

1493
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,850
And I don't like to have my
cell phone on and in my pocket,

1494
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,943
I'm well past puberty, but nonetheless

1495
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:49,550
some of these effects were
seen in adult animals.

1496
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,540
There are effects now that have
been demonstrated in humans.

1497
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,290
So let's just talk about
a couple of those effects.

1498
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:58,680
So a paper published in the
journal, "Clinical Biochemistry"

1499
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,623
from S. Gander et al.

1500
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,520
Looked at hormone profiles
in people based on

1501
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,450
proximity to their phone
and frequency of phone use,

1502
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,510
where they stored their
phone on their body.

1503
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:15,690
Aa well as proximity
of where they lived to,

1504
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,160
I guess they're called these
radio-frequency towers.

1505
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,800
So the base stations.

1506
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,740
And they were looking at

1507
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:26,250
effects of radio frequency radiation RFR

1508
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,800
on human hormone profiles.

1509
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,650
And they show significant
decreases in cortisol.

1510
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,100
You might say, "Well, that might be good."

1511
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,750
But you need that morning cortisol bump

1512
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,600
in order to wake up.

1513
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,450
Morning cortisol is good.

1514
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,110
But also thyroid hormones
were significantly reduced.

1515
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:43,010
Prolactin in young females,

1516
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,770
that's definitely concerning

1517
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,350
and testosterone levels
in males and females.

1518
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:52,590
And so, there are now quite
good data showing that

1519
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:55,260
being close to the phone
too much of the day

1520
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,170
and how close is an interesting question

1521
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,650
or living near one of these base stations

1522
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:04,700
apparently can have effects
on hormone profiles.

1523
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,130
And when you see a study like this

1524
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,397
one should always ask,

1525
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:09,763
"Well, what are the other things

1526
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:12,250
that could also have effects
on these hormone profiles?"

1527
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,010
Right? Cause you could imagine that

1528
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,690
if you ran the same study

1529
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,690
of people that live close to a waterway,

1530
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,150
or close to a highway
where there's a lot of

1531
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,040
exhaust from buses and cars,

1532
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,400
you might see similar effects.

1533
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,950
So you have to take these sorts of studies

1534
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,030
with a grain of salt.

1535
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,280
But I think it's very interesting.

1536
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,660
And given that the last time
I looked into these data

1537
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,110
were way back when I
was a junior professor

1538
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,800
and there was like one or two
studies that I could find.

1539
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,740
One of the studies pointed to

1540
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,810
increases in testosterone in rats,

1541
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:42,010
where they were had
close proximity to these

1542
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,340
radio-frequency radiation waves.

1543
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,960
And then in the other case,

1544
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,540
it showed decreases in testosterone.

1545
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,740
So there really wasn't any
conclusion to takeaway from that.

1546
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:57,240
Now, there's pretty
impressive amount of data

1547
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,530
pointing to the fact that

1548
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,950
there are effects of
these things on hormones.

1549
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,470
I don't know what to do
with that information.

1550
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,463
I'm not going to stop using my phone but,

1551
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:09,283
in light of the work from Tyrone
Hayes and others looking at

1552
01:02:09,283 --> 01:02:13,430
sperm counts and looking
at the decrease in

1553
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,170
testosterone levels and
sperm counts and fertility

1554
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,450
over the last 20, 30 years,

1555
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,880
perhaps it's you know, not surprising.

1556
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,340
Although there again,

1557
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,270
cell phones and smartphones
have really been

1558
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:28,480
in prominent use mostly within
the last 10 or 11 years.

1559
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,170
And so it's hard to explain
all of those declines

1560
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,800
simply on the basis of cell phone use.

1561
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,570
There's some interesting
effects of hormones

1562
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,990
that actually you can observe
on the outside of people,

1563
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,330
that tell you something about

1564
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:43,270
not just their level of hormones,

1565
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,720
but also about their underlying genetics.

1566
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,270
And these relate to beard
growth and baldness.

1567
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,483
And it's fascinating.

1568
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,123
The molecule, the hormone
dihydrotestosterone,

1569
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,246
made from testosterone,

1570
01:02:56,246 --> 01:03:00,150
is the hormone primarily
responsible for facial hair,

1571
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,113
for beard growth.

1572
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,140
As well, it's the molecule,

1573
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,680
the hormone primarily responsible for

1574
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,360
lack of hair on the head, for hair loss.

1575
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,600
So how does that work?

1576
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,640
Well, DHT circulates in the body

1577
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:19,100
and it binds to DHT receptors in the face

1578
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,380
to promote hair growth.

1579
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,470
But it binds to DHD receptors on the scalp

1580
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,193
to promote hair loss.

1581
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,640
Not incidentally,

1582
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,000
the drugs that are designed
to prevent hair loss

1583
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,560
are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.

1584
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,180
So remember 5-alpha-reductase
from the Guevedoces?

1585
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:42,550
Well, the people that
discovered the Güevedoces,

1586
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:44,300
went on to do a lot of research

1587
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,160
on the underlying biochemistry

1588
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,580
of this really interesting
molecule dihydrotestosterone.

1589
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,800
They identified 5-alpha-reductase.

1590
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,390
and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors

1591
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:57,560
are the basis of most of the

1592
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,720
anti-hair loss treatments
that are out there.

1593
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,340
And so there's some
interesting things here.

1594
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,080
First of all, the side effect profiles

1595
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,140
of those treatments for hair loss

1596
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,280
are quite severe in many individuals.

1597
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,690
Remember DHT is the primary androgen

1598
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:17,590
for libido, for strengthened
connective tissue repair,

1599
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,588
for aggression.

1600
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:22,640
Even if that aggression of
course is held in check,

1601
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,570
but just sort of ambition and aggression

1602
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,650
is related to dopamine,

1603
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,020
but within the testosterone pathway,

1604
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,140
less so pure testosterone,

1605
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,910
although pure testosterone
has its effects.

1606
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:36,410
But DHT is, at least in primate
species including humans,

1607
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:40,670
is the dominant androgen for
most of those sorts of effects.

1608
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,205
And if you look at somebody,

1609
01:04:43,205 --> 01:04:46,100
everyone can predict whether or not

1610
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,350
they're going to go bald
based on looking at their,

1611
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:50,300
we're always taught our mother's father.

1612
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,670
So if your mother's father was bald,

1613
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:54,050
there's a higher probability that

1614
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,100
you're going to go bald.

1615
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,000
The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp,

1616
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,600
will dictate whether or not
you're going to go bald everywhere

1617
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,250
or just in the front or the
so called crown type baldness.

1618
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,310
And the density of the
beard tells you about

1619
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,970
the density of DHT receptors.

1620
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:13,210
Now this varies by background,
by genetic background.

1621
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,290
And actually around the world nowadays,

1622
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,550
because people travel and people

1623
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,729
form couples and have kids with

1624
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:22,480
so many different people of
different mixed cultures.

1625
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,910
You're seeing this starting to disappear.

1626
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:26,120
But there are areas areas of the world

1627
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,780
where all the men seem to

1628
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,070
have the same pattern of baldness,

1629
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,800
like a strip of baldness down the center,

1630
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,100
with hair still on the
sides and and full beards.

1631
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,240
That's because these
patterns of DHT receptors

1632
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,070
are genetically determined.

1633
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,800
Elsewhere, testosterone
levels can still be very high,

1634
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,600
DHT levels in the blood can be very high

1635
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,330
and yet people will have very
light beards or no beards.

1636
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:49,560
And that's because

1637
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,300
they don't have a lot of
DHT receptors in the face.

1638
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,480
And in still other cultures

1639
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,010
you'll see people with huge beard,

1640
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:56,940
tons of beard.

1641
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,570
Their beards are growing
all the way up to their eyes

1642
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,820
and they have huge heads of hair.

1643
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,910
And that's because they have a lot of

1644
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,890
DHT receptors on the face
and not on the scalp.

1645
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,310
So there are a lot of effects of DHT

1646
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:09,410
that you can just see in male phenotypes.

1647
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,310
And it's interesting that
these hair loss drugs

1648
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,680
that are,

1649
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,950
or to prevent hair loss drugs,

1650
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:19,340
are directly aimed at preventing

1651
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,870
the conversion of testosterone
into dihydrotestosterone.

1652
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,000
And that's why they to some
extent prevent hair loss,

1653
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,160
but also to some extent have,

1654
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,840
a bunch of side effects that
are associated with low DHT.

1655
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,400
Along these lines there's a particular

1656
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,830
sports supplement that a lot
of people use called Creatine.

1657
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:40,210
Creatine, now there's a lot
of research showing that

1658
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,740
Creatine can bring more
more water into the muscle.

1659
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,442
It can support strength.

1660
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:47,740
It does a number of other things.

1661
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,220
Might even have some
important cognitive promoting.

1662
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,220
Cognitive enhancement
effects, although mild.

1663
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,963
The studies there show
that it can be significant.

1664
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,700
Some people, not all it's more anecdotal,

1665
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,013
report that creatine promotes hair loss.

1666
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:04,570
It differs by individual.

1667
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:07,380
For some people that's
true, for others no.

1668
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,870
But yes it does appear,

1669
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:10,950
based on the studies I was
able to find on PubMed,

1670
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:15,330
that creatine does promote
5-alpha-reductase activity

1671
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,470
and therefore the
conversion of testosterone

1672
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,220
into dihydrotestosterone.

1673
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,800
And so it makes sense
that it might promote

1674
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,020
some degree of hair loss,
as well as beard growth,

1675
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,263
as well as the other effects of DHT.

1676
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,420
I recall in junior high
school and middle school,

1677
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,180
going home one Summer
it was seventh grade,

1678
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,140
coming back in the eighth grade

1679
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:36,050
and a kid that I knew
that I was friends with,

1680
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,420
went from being like a young kid to,

1681
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,440
he was like a grown man,
he had a full beard.

1682
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,273
It was amazing.

1683
01:07:41,273 --> 01:07:42,920
It was like he would
completely transformed.

1684
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,470
And in puberty as I've said before,

1685
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,954
is without a doubt the most accelerated

1686
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:50,220
rate of development
that we will go through

1687
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,710
at any point in our lives.

1688
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:54,300
Even faster than infancy
just in terms of the

1689
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,280
huge number of different cognitive changes

1690
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,210
and physical changes.

1691
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,680
Not surprisingly that same individual

1692
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,600
was mostly or bald by his early twenties.

1693
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,040
And that's because he must have had

1694
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,070
just exceedingly high levels of DHT.

1695
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:09,400
I also played soccer with this kid

1696
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,250
and he was basically like
dribbling past everybody.

1697
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,083
It who was like a grown man,

1698
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,990
playing soccer with a
bunch of little kids.

1699
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,100
Full beard you know, bald at 20.

1700
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,970
And so the rate of
maturation, the rate of aging

1701
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:20,979
is very interesting.

1702
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:22,429
It's hard to know rate of aging.

1703
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,689
There's some genetic tests that now

1704
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:24,649
can allow you to do that.

1705
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:27,609
Things like Horvath Clocks
and things of that sort.

1706
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,919
Beautiful work of David
Sinclair at Harvard and others

1707
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,520
has pointed to this.

1708
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,520
The speed of entry and
exit from puberty might be,

1709
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:38,439
I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis.

1710
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:40,129
Might be an interesting window,

1711
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,689
into how fast one is going through

1712
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:44,549
their aging or developmental arc.

1713
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,069
Because development of course,

1714
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:48,479
doesn't just start at birth
and end after puberty.

1715
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,599
It continues your entire life.

1716
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,620
So I think it's interesting.

1717
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:57,560
You will often see that
people, boys and girls.

1718
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,220
I should say boys or girls,

1719
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:02,670
will develop secondary
sexual characteristics

1720
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:03,660
at different rates.

1721
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,340
And sometimes it's sequential.

1722
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,376
You know you might see a kid will,

1723
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,120
she'll grow very tall

1724
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,960
or she'll have a big growth spurt,

1725
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,979
but then breast development
will come a little bit later.

1726
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:16,339
And then other features will
come a little bit later.

1727
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,010
You can also see this in boys.

1728
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,720
The person that I referred to earlier,

1729
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,859
my friend that developed a full
beard, you know, went bald.

1730
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,269
He was also quite muscular,
he was a great athlete.

1731
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:27,439
So he went through
puberty exceedingly fast.

1732
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,159
Other people go through it more slowly.

1733
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,750
Some people will go
through puberty at age 14,

1734
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:35,040
but they won't start to
accumulate facial hair

1735
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,979
until much, much later.

1736
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:40,049
Or their voice will
change first, very early.

1737
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,300
And then they won't get

1738
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,520
the other secondary sexual characteristics

1739
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,689
until much later.

1740
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:48,309
And so, we don't really
know how that impacts

1741
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,479
or relates to overall
trajectory or rate of aging.

1742
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,819
But it's an interesting
thing to think about

1743
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:55,340
for each and every one of us.

1744
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,750
I'm going to offer you the opportunity

1745
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,950
to do an experiment today,

1746
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,230
while listening to the podcast.

1747
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:04,100
But first I want to tell you a story about

1748
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,550
hyenas, professional baseball

1749
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:10,980
and clitoris's the size of penises.

1750
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,440
So when I was a graduate
student at UC Berkeley,

1751
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,760
we had a professor in our department,

1752
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,530
phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.

1753
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:26,530
Steve Glickman, had a colony
of hyenas, spotted hyenas

1754
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,570
that lived, within caged
enclosures of course,

1755
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:33,210
in Tilden Park behind
the UC Berkeley campus.

1756
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,950
The enclosures are actually still there.

1757
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,990
I run past there fairly often.

1758
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,060
The hyenas are no longer there.

1759
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,380
This was a Federally Funded field station.

1760
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,660
These animals were
brought over from Africa

1761
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,530
or were bred there.

1762
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:50,083
And the reason why they
were hyenas in Tilden Park,

1763
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,530
enclosed in Tilden Park.

1764
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:56,910
Was because hyenas exhibit
an incredible feature

1765
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,633
to their body, their hormones
and their social structure.

1766
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:05,690
Hyenas, unlike many species,

1767
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:08,550
have a situation with
their genitalia where

1768
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:12,490
the male penis is actually smaller

1769
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,990
than the female clitoris.

1770
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:17,240
And I should say that
the male penis itself,

1771
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,880
having seen a fair
number of hyena penises,

1772
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,730
is not particularly small.

1773
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:26,773
Which means that the hyena
clitoris's are extremely large.

1774
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:30,260
This was well known for some time.

1775
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:33,720
It turns out that in these spotted hyenas

1776
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:37,060
the females are dominant.

1777
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,460
So after a kill

1778
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,280
the females will eat, then
they're young will eat.

1779
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,883
And then the male hyenas will eat.

1780
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,120
As well,

1781
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,060
when the female hyena gives birth,

1782
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:53,120
she gives birth, not
through the vaginal canal

1783
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,490
that we're accustomed to seeing,

1784
01:11:56,490 --> 01:12:01,490
but through a very enlarged
clitoris's like phallus.

1785
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:05,710
Although it's not a
phallus, it's a clitoris.

1786
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:07,710
And it literally splits open.

1787
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,600
So many fetuses die during the course of

1788
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,253
hyena development and birth.

1789
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,410
These animals have this,

1790
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:18,070
what could only be described as

1791
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,000
a very large or giant clitoris.

1792
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,310
Although for a hyena it's
not giant, it's normal.

1793
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:25,270
And it splits open and the
baby actually comes through.

1794
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:29,130
The baby hyena actually
comes through the tissue

1795
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:31,670
and it's it's a very traumatic birth.

1796
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:33,920
A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.

1797
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,890
And as I mentioned, a
lot of baby hyenas die.

1798
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:41,720
It was a mystery as to how
the female hyenas have this

1799
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,040
we'll call it masculinization,

1800
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,500
but it's really a androgen jet.

1801
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:50,580
Excuse me, androgenization
of the periphery.

1802
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,500
Of the genitalia.

1803
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,470
And it turns out, through
a lot of careful research

1804
01:12:55,470 --> 01:13:00,040
done by Steve Glickman,
Christine Drey and others.

1805
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,740
That it's androstenedione.

1806
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:06,653
What is essentially a pro
hormone to testosterone?

1807
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,570
It's androstenedione at very high levels

1808
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:13,630
that's produced in female hyenas

1809
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,690
that creates this enlargement
of their genitalia.

1810
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,267
So if you want to read
up on androstenedione.

1811
01:13:19,267 --> 01:13:22,050
Androstenedione is made into testosterone

1812
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:27,050
through this enzyme 17-beta-hydroxy
steroid dehydrogenase

1813
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:32,340
it's a complicated pathway to pronounce.

1814
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,630
It's a fairly straightforward
pathway biochemically.

1815
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:39,270
You may recall during the 90's and 2000's

1816
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,630
there were a lot of performance
enhancing drug scandals,

1817
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:45,080
in particular in Major League Baseball.

1818
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,700
And it was purported,

1819
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,700
although I don't know
that it was ever verified.

1820
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,920
But it was purported that the major

1821
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,000
performance enhancing drug
of abuse at that time,

1822
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,060
in particular players whose
names we won't mention

1823
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,420
but you can Google it
if you want to find out.

1824
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,560
Was androstenedione.

1825
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,530
And I actually recall long ago,

1826
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:05,540
when you could buy androstenedione

1827
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,580
in the health food stores.

1828
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,130
And so it was sold over the counter.

1829
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:13,160
So a lot's changed since then.

1830
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,400
But it's interesting that these hyenas,

1831
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,030
with these highly androgenized genitalia

1832
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,310
accomplish that through

1833
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:24,840
high levels of androstenedione
in the females.

1834
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,200
Now if that's unusual,

1835
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,450
what might be even more unusual is that

1836
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,300
a graduate student that I
was working with at the time.

1837
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,250
Alongside we didn't share research.

1838
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,550
Her name was Nicola Sitka.

1839
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,980
She is actually a trained behavioral,

1840
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,390
animal behavioral expert.

1841
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:43,810
She had trained ferrets for
that show the "BeastMaster."

1842
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,710
And she had trained wolves
for television shows

1843
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:47,810
and was a dog trainer.

1844
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:49,490
She had these two large dogs that,

1845
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:51,370
unlike my dog would actually listen to her

1846
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:53,720
when she would give them commands.

1847
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:55,110
A remarkable scientist.

1848
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:58,380
She was studying a species of mole

1849
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,910
that also lived in Tilden Park.

1850
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:01,780
People are going to start
to wonder about Tilden Park,

1851
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,080
what's in Tilden Park?

1852
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,670
But this particular mole that lived there

1853
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,100
had testes for part of the year

1854
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,710
and had the capacity
to trans differentiate

1855
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:13,830
its testes into ovaries

1856
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:15,430
in order to balance out the ratio

1857
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,300
of males and females in the population

1858
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,470
to keep reproduction at appropriate levels

1859
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:22,290
for that certain population.

1860
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:24,040
So some animals are actually able

1861
01:15:25,176 --> 01:15:29,210
to adjust whether or not
they have androgenized

1862
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:32,100
or estrogenized gonads,

1863
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:36,900
in order to adjust the ratios of offspring

1864
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,900
or the males and females in
therefor promote offspring.

1865
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,010
And the last little anecdote about this,

1866
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,170
which is also published in
the scientific literature,

1867
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:47,390
which is weird but I do find interesting.

1868
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:48,720
Hormones are so fascinating,

1869
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,980
they're just incredible to me is

1870
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,720
going back to the marijuana plant.

1871
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,860
You know, the marijuana plant

1872
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,783
has these estrogenic properties.

1873
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:01,770
And I asked a plant biologist

1874
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,423
whether or not this was unusual.

1875
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,700
And I asked because

1876
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,767
there's all this stuff out there about,

1877
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:09,350
"Oh, you know, Soy does this.

1878
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:12,970
And these plants are highly
estrogenic, et cetera."

1879
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,060
Although we should probably point out that

1880
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,850
a lot of factory meats
are also estrogenic.

1881
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:18,060
So this isn't a meat versus plants thing.

1882
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,227
But this plant biologist told me,

1883
01:16:19,227 --> 01:16:22,670
"Oh yeah, there are plants that make

1884
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:26,040
what is essentially the
equivalent of testosterone

1885
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,540
like pine pollen as it looks
a lot like testosterone.

1886
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,380
And there are other plants that make

1887
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,060
what is essentially estrogen.

1888
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,320
And I said, "Well, why
would they do that?"

1889
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,600
Well and you know plants,

1890
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,640
at least as far as I know,

1891
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,630
don't have a consciousness.

1892
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:39,580
They don't have a brain.

1893
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,713
They don't have neurons even but,

1894
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,270
his answer was fascinating.

1895
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:49,130
He said that, one of the
reasons why some plants

1896
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:51,120
have evolved this capacity

1897
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,280
to increase estrogen levels

1898
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:57,120
in animals that smoke, not smoke it

1899
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,710
but then animals that consume them.

1900
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,570
I'm guessing that animals
aren't smoking marijuana.

1901
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,210
Although I don't know, send me the paper

1902
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:04,030
if you've heard of this.

1903
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,890
Is that plants have figured out ways.

1904
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:10,100
They've adapted ways to
push back on populations

1905
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,100
of rodents and other species
of animals that eat them.

1906
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,490
So plants are engaged in a kind of

1907
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,690
plant to animal warfare

1908
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:19,370
where they increase the estrogen

1909
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:20,910
of the males in that population

1910
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,210
to lower the sperm counts,

1911
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:25,450
to keep those populations
clamped at certain levels

1912
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:28,350
so that those plants can
continue to flourish.

1913
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:33,190
Even if those animals are
reproducing very robustly.

1914
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,210
And I find this just fascinating.

1915
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,800
And hormones therefore,

1916
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,890
aren't just impacting tissue
growth and development

1917
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,380
within the individual
and between the mother.

1918
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,410
Remember the placenta
is an endocrine organ,

1919
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,400
and the offspring,

1920
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,890
but plants and animals
are in this communication.

1921
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,420
And today we're in this communication,

1922
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,310
I'm telling you that

1923
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,510
there are certain herbicides
that humans are using

1924
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,040
for which there's very good data,

1925
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,410
are disrupting the endocrine pathways.

1926
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,640
And so it's fascinating that

1927
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,200
humans and other animals,

1928
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,700
we're always in this interplay

1929
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,930
with plants and the other
things in our environment.

1930
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,980
And hormones and adjusting
the hormone levels

1931
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,440
of animals and plants is one way in which

1932
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,110
the environment kind of pushes back

1933
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,240
or pushes forward if you will,

1934
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,780
in terms of promoting their
well-being and longevity,

1935
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,010
as well as you trying to promote

1936
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,830
your wellbeing and longevity.

1937
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,970
If anyone wants to see
the incredible paper

1938
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,940
by Steve Glickman and colleagues.

1939
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:30,060
It was published in the proceedings
of the national Academy.

1940
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,430
First in 1987, that's Glickman et al.

1941
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:35,900
That was the hypothesis that
it was androstenedione .

1942
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,870
And then if you just Google

1943
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:41,150
Glickman hyenas science magazine,

1944
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,755
there's a beautiful
cover article and feature

1945
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:45,870
all about that important discovery,

1946
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,280
it's a fascinating one.

1947
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,340
And I should mention also
that those discoveries,

1948
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:53,267
both the moles and the hyenas weren't just

1949
01:18:53,267 --> 01:18:55,680
impactful for the world of animal behavior

1950
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,513
and endocrinology,

1951
01:18:56,513 --> 01:18:59,490
they've also strongly
impacted understanding

1952
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:01,670
of conditions that show up in the clinic,

1953
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,640
which we haven't talked about today.

1954
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,080
Which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism.

1955
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,160
Occasionally babies will be
born where it is unclear,

1956
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,240
if they are boys or girls
based on the genitalia.

1957
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:17,940
And this has a very important
ethical and other issues.

1958
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:20,010
Do you raise them as a boy or a girl?

1959
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:23,610
It's not super uncommon
for this to happen.

1960
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:26,830
And there have been terrible
cases where people have

1961
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:30,410
gone against the chromosomal sex.

1962
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:32,840
And the person was very unhappy

1963
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,940
with the the choice that their
parents had made for them.

1964
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,310
There were also cases where

1965
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,337
they've gone with a chromosomal sex

1966
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:40,140
and the person was very
happy about the outcome.

1967
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:40,973
There've been cases where

1968
01:19:40,973 --> 01:19:42,290
they've been treated with hormones

1969
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,750
and there been cases where they have not

1970
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,686
been treated with hormones.

1971
01:19:45,686 --> 01:19:48,402
It's a complicated literature and

1972
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:52,420
it has to be sorted out on
kind of a case by case basis,

1973
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,290
but it is something that does happen.

1974
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,000
And the studies on
androstenedione in hyenas

1975
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,900
and in these very interesting moles,

1976
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,860
pseudo-hermaphroditic moles
that live in Tilden Park,

1977
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,080
have impacted not just the science

1978
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,310
but the therapeutics around
those important issues.

1979
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,550
So now last but not least,

1980
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:13,890
I want to discuss the effects of hormones

1981
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:18,610
while you and I were separately in utero

1982
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:22,313
and the effects that
that had on who we are,

1983
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:26,490
who we select as mates.

1984
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:29,010
So mate choice, sexual preference.

1985
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:33,490
And all other aspects
of what you would call

1986
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:35,430
sexual development.

1987
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,650
Now this is something that's
gotten a lot of popular press

1988
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:40,110
and it has to do with

1989
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:42,990
how exposure to androgens in particular

1990
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,110
while we were in utero,

1991
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,640
impacted whether or not people report

1992
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,220
as homosexual, heterosexual,

1993
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,770
identify as male or female.

1994
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,250
I'm very familiar with this work

1995
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,530
because I was a graduate student

1996
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:57,340
in the department that
first published this work

1997
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,610
and I'm an author on the paper.

1998
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,650
I was not the main driver of the work,

1999
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,570
but I was involved in the work.

2000
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:06,120
And I certainly know the
people that did this work.

2001
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,453
First it starts with a story.

2002
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:13,800
There was a researcher
who's still going now.

2003
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,490
His name is Dennis McFadden.

2004
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:19,100
I believe he was at UT Austin back then.

2005
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:22,220
And he was studying the auditory system.

2006
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,730
And people would come into
his clinic and he would,

2007
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,750
or his laboratory.

2008
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,600
And he would look at hearing

2009
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,150
and he would explore different aspects

2010
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,760
of what they call the
psychophysics of hearing

2011
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,340
and understanding hearing thresholds

2012
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,850
and frequency thresholds.

2013
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,923
And he made several observations.

2014
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,670
And those observations were that

2015
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:44,300
young males tended to have

2016
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,090
what are called auto acoustic emissions,

2017
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:49,810
more often than young females did.

2018
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:52,210
Auto acoustic emissions,
as the name suggests,

2019
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,670
are the ears actually making sounds.

2020
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:56,150
Now these sounds have to be picked up

2021
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:57,440
by a special apparatus,

2022
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,930
because they can hear into that frequency.

2023
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:01,670
But it turns out that your ears don't just

2024
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,496
take sound waves and convert them into

2025
01:22:03,496 --> 01:22:05,330
this thing we call hearing.

2026
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,530
But they also in some cases make sound.

2027
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,090
So your ears are making sounds.

2028
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,400
Strange right?

2029
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,937
So it turns out that there's a

2030
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:16,770
sex difference in auto acoustic emissions.

2031
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:20,513
It turns out also that people
that self-report as lesbians,

2032
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,220
they also have auto acoustic emissions

2033
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,510
significantly more than females

2034
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:29,500
that don't self-report as lesbian.

2035
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:33,560
And Dennis noticed this
and published this.

2036
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,230
And it was an important discovery because

2037
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:38,060
it was one of the first discoveries

2038
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:42,090
that pointed to the fact that there are

2039
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:46,950
sex differences in biology
that are independent of sex.

2040
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,180
I mean, this is hearing and
auto acoustic emissions.

2041
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,620
And just to really illustrate what that.

2042
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:54,140
What the former problem was

2043
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,797
and why this study was so important?

2044
01:22:55,797 --> 01:22:58,140
You know, a lot of people had explored

2045
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,543
for instance whether or not,

2046
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,770
homosexuals had lower testosterone
for instance in males.

2047
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:06,790
And actually the result
often was the opposite.

2048
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:10,050
That gay men or men
that self-report is gay,

2049
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:12,460
often had much higher testosterone.

2050
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,070
And those studies then
became controversial

2051
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:15,903
because people said,

2052
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:19,030
"Well, sexual behavior can
relate to testosterone,"

2053
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,863
et cetera.

2054
01:23:19,863 --> 01:23:21,220
And so it became very controversial.

2055
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,720
And then there were some studies

2056
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,210
that attempted to look at
the equivalent phenomenon in

2057
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,130
people that self report as lesbian.

2058
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:30,290
Or self-report as heterosexual.

2059
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,860
And so it became very complicated.

2060
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:36,190
But this was an identification
of a phenomenon,

2061
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:37,680
auto acoustic emissions,

2062
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,610
that was independent of
anything that had to do with

2063
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:41,543
sexual or even social behavior.

2064
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,983
1998 rolls around.

2065
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,950
And I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley

2066
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,930
and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove.

2067
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:54,145
Kind of an ironic name,
given that he worked on.

2068
01:23:54,145 --> 01:23:56,560
He worked and still works
on sexual dimorphism

2069
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,410
in the brain and in the spinal
cord and nervous system.

2070
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,310
And Mark, who's a phenomenal scientist

2071
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,780
comes running down the hall.

2072
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,650
I'll never forget this.

2073
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,125
And he said, "Give me your hands."

2074
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:07,958
I was like, [indistinct].

2075
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:09,017
He's like, "Give me your hands."

2076
01:24:09,017 --> 01:24:09,850
And he pulls out a ruler

2077
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:10,683
and he starts measuring my fingers.

2078
01:24:10,683 --> 01:24:11,920
And he takes down a couple of measurements

2079
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,150
and then he goes away.

2080
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,540
And I was like, "What was that?"

2081
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,380
Well, I was in a course
that Mark was teaching

2082
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:19,860
at that point.

2083
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:24,860
And soon after, we did a
study that Mark directed

2084
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,060
exploring the finger length ratios.

2085
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,690
And I'll explain what those are.

2086
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:34,050
Of males and females,

2087
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:38,510
and people that self-reported
as homosexual or heterosexual.

2088
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:40,830
So let's just get to the basic,

2089
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,550
what we'll call sex differences first.

2090
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:44,770
These are averages.

2091
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,603
I want to point out.

2092
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:47,030
Anytime you get into this kind of topic,

2093
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:49,390
people assume it's causal,
but it's not causal.

2094
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:51,590
These are averages that
I'm about to report.

2095
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,560
It is the case that the ratio

2096
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,020
of what's called the D2 to D4 digits.

2097
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,890
So the D2 is your index finger.

2098
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:01,140
So your thumb is D1.

2099
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,390
Then D2 would be your index finger

2100
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,610
that you would point with.

2101
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:06,320
Middle finger is D3,
which you whatever with.

2102
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,330
And then D4 is the so-called ring finger.

2103
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,783
Okay and D5 is the pinky.

2104
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:15,490
It is the case that

2105
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:19,210
the D2 to D4 ratio is greater

2106
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:23,650
in self-reported females
than it is in males.

2107
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:24,483
What does that mean?

2108
01:25:24,483 --> 01:25:29,483
It means that digit D4 and
D4 are more similar in length

2109
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,730
in females than in men males.

2110
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:34,800
And that effect is
particularly, excuse me,

2111
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,470
pronounced on the right hand.

2112
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,499
Although not always, okay?

2113
01:25:39,499 --> 01:25:41,470
And it does not have
to do with handedness.

2114
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:45,850
This D2 to D4 difference has
to be measured correctly.

2115
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,657
You can't just look at
somebody who's hands and say,

2116
01:25:47,657 --> 01:25:52,010
"Oh, their ring finger and
index finger are very similar.

2117
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:55,680
And therefore they are female you know.

2118
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,920
Or they were exposed to very
little testosterone in utero."

2119
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,800
You can't look at somebody and see that

2120
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,250
their index finger is much
shorter than their ring finger

2121
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,710
and say, "Oh, they must've been exposed

2122
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:06,780
to a lot of androgen."

2123
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,150
You have to actually measure it

2124
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:09,910
and you have to measure it correctly.

2125
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,250
You have to measure it from

2126
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,950
the base of the finger where
there's that first crease,

2127
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:16,211
all the way to the tip past the.

2128
01:26:16,211 --> 01:26:17,700
You can't include the fingernails.

2129
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,820
If you're growing fingernails,

2130
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,170
it'd be logical here folks.

2131
01:26:21,318 --> 01:26:24,970
So you can't normally see it
from the back of the hand.

2132
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:27,960
Although, I don't know if
this'll show up here but

2133
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,300
if you look at the back of the hand

2134
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,829
sometimes you can see it.

2135
01:26:30,829 --> 01:26:32,920
You know, in my case for instance.

2136
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,000
Let me see if I can do this.

2137
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,760
So my D4 is a little
bit longer than my D2.

2138
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,360
In some people it's more pronounced

2139
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,320
and that's on my right hand.

2140
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,153
On the other hand,

2141
01:26:41,153 --> 01:26:42,550
the difference actually
is far less pronounced.

2142
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:43,840
Is it's a little bit.

2143
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,720
it's a little bit pronounced
there, but not so much okay?

2144
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:50,643
So that's sort of the typical
ratio that you would see.

2145
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:54,763
It turns out that in mice and in humans,

2146
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:59,203
the more androgen that you
were exposed to in utero,

2147
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,020
the smaller the D4 D2 ratio.

2148
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,540
Meaning that the ring finger tends to be

2149
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:07,490
slightly longer than the pointer finger.

2150
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,370
And in females because they're exposed to

2151
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:13,170
less androgen in utero typically.

2152
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:15,360
Then those fingers tend to
be more equal in length.

2153
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,870
And these are subtle differences

2154
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,070
and these are averages.

2155
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,950
I invite you to look up the paper.

2156
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:21,830
This was published in Nature in 2000

2157
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:26,420
and it's been replicated six times.

2158
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:28,820
Now, here's where it gets
even more interesting.

2159
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:31,580
And potentially precarious,

2160
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,380
so we're going to step cautiously here.

2161
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,290
If you look at the finger length ratios

2162
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:40,690
of men that self-report as homosexual,

2163
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:45,630
they have either the typical
male pattern of D2 to D4 ratio

2164
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:49,240
or a hyper masculinized D4 to D2 ratio.

2165
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,700
Now this can't be something

2166
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,730
that's established or
modified by behavior.

2167
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:55,970
This has to be something that
was established in utero.

2168
01:27:55,970 --> 01:28:00,520
And in fact, it's present at birth okay?

2169
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,980
So it completely divorces

2170
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:05,300
the interactions between
hormones and behavior.

2171
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,200
And that's an important theme
that we've been talking about.

2172
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,290
And we're going to talk about even more.

2173
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:10,430
Next episode is that
hormones impact behavior

2174
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:12,130
but behavior also impact hormones.

2175
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:14,900
But this is a case of hormones impacting

2176
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,360
what really should be considered

2177
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,830
a primary sexual characteristic.

2178
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:20,280
Because it doesn't show up in puberty,

2179
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,420
it shows up before puberty.

2180
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:23,940
It's actually established in utero.

2181
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:27,070
And in people that self-reported lesbians.

2182
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,290
And I remember going out there

2183
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:30,320
and collecting these data with,

2184
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,900
with the collaborators on this work.

2185
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,660
Again, I wasn't the
main driver on the work.

2186
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:36,250
But I participated in
some of the analysis.

2187
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,170
People that self-report as lesbians

2188
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:43,170
also tend to have a
smaller D2 to D4 ratio.

2189
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,420
So this is consistent with the
auto acoustic emission study

2190
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:48,250
that Dennis McFadden had published.

2191
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:51,910
And it points to the fact that
early exposure to androgens

2192
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,630
may have an impact,

2193
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:59,580
not just on androgenization
of the body plan,

2194
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:04,580
but also separately on sexual preference.

2195
01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:06,990
Now, this raises all sorts
of interesting questions

2196
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:09,010
about biological basis
of sexual preference.

2197
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,870
I'll tell you about another study.

2198
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:13,810
A guy named Simon LeVay who was at UCLA.

2199
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:16,630
Who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.

2200
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:18,780
If any of you remember early
episodes on "Plasticy,"

2201
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:20,320
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel

2202
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,900
my scientific great-grandparents
won the Nobel Prize

2203
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,670
for discovery of critical
periods for brain plasticity.

2204
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,620
They defined some of the
most important aspects

2205
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:31,640
of how we see and brain plasticity.

2206
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,890
Simon LeVay trained with them.

2207
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,670
And then Simon went on to discover that

2208
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:40,660
in the brains of people
that self-report homosexual

2209
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,400
there is a brain difference.

2210
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,190
And the brain difference
is in an area called

2211
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,543
the Interstitial Nucleus of
the Anterior Hypothalamus.

2212
01:29:48,387 --> 01:29:49,550
So it's the INAH.

2213
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:54,770
And so there are published reports.

2214
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:56,380
That was published in Science.

2215
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:58,160
The other work I refer to
as published in Nature,

2216
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,730
and then replicated no
fewer than six times.

2217
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,954
And the McFadden results that point to

2218
01:30:02,954 --> 01:30:06,790
strong biological correlates

2219
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:11,590
of mate choice, of sexual preference.

2220
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:14,440
And these tie directly to

2221
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:18,900
things like androgenization
or estrogenization.

2222
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,970
Meaning we could call it
maleness or femaleness,

2223
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:22,660
but that's sort of tricky territory.

2224
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:23,920
Because of the way that we described

2225
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,040
the huge range in which
sex can be defined earlier.

2226
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,870
So, if you want to
measure your D2 D4 ratio

2227
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:31,830
you're welcome to,

2228
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:34,110
but you also have to understand that

2229
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:36,760
it's not predictive of anything, right?

2230
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,060
It's just a window into the possible

2231
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,610
androgen exposure that
you had early in life.

2232
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:44,730
There are plenty of men
who report themselves

2233
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,410
as heterosexual who are out there

2234
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:50,360
who have similar or have
D2 D4 ratios to females.

2235
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,840
And there are plenty of
females whose index fingers

2236
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,530
are shorter than their ring fingers.

2237
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:55,790
And they're perfectly happy

2238
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:57,590
where they say they're perfectly happy.

2239
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:00,150
And we are inclined to believe
them being heterosexual.

2240
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:01,090
So there's variation.

2241
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:03,040
In fact, Mark tells a really good joke.

2242
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,030
If you want to know whether or not

2243
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:09,060
somebody is homosexual or heterosexual,

2244
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,810
simply look at their hands,

2245
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:15,260
look at their D2 D4 ratio
and guess heterosexual.

2246
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:17,560
And you'll be right 96% of the time.

2247
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,140
Because 96% of the time

2248
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,020
people report themselves
as heterosexual on average.

2249
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,710
Those numbers might be changing.

2250
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,291
So the joke really is a
joke on science because,

2251
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:30,000
that falls within the realm
of statistical significance.

2252
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,970
And yet it really
illustrates the fact that

2253
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,830
none of this is causal.

2254
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:35,620
But it's nonetheless very interesting

2255
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:37,870
because it means that
hormones are organizing

2256
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:40,540
the brain early in
development in ways that

2257
01:31:40,540 --> 01:31:42,380
can potentially impact

2258
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,970
same or opposite sex partner
choice later in life.

2259
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:48,090
Now of course, there are
other things that can impact

2260
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,734
opposite sex or same-sex
partner choice later in life.

2261
01:31:50,734 --> 01:31:54,630
The study did not look at
people who reported bisexual.

2262
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:57,800
There hasn't been a lot
of studies on that yet.

2263
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,440
One thing that's very interesting,

2264
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,990
for which there are some
good scientific data

2265
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:04,840
but there's also some controversy is that,

2266
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:09,170
it appears that the
probability of a male human

2267
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,910
self-reporting as homosexual,

2268
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:16,450
increases with the number of
older brothers that he has.

2269
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:18,240
Now, that doesn't mean if
you have an older brother

2270
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,840
or even if you have 10 older brothers,

2271
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,900
that you are sure to
self-report as homosexual.

2272
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:27,900
But statistically it becomes
more likely that somebody will

2273
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,550
with each successive older
brother that they have.

2274
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:33,210
And the idea that starting to emerge,

2275
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:36,709
in the developmental
neuroendocrinology landscape

2276
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:41,150
is that there's a record within the mother

2277
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:43,430
of how many male fetuses she's carried,

2278
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:46,420
because male fetuses are
secreting certain things,

2279
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,720
dihydrotestosterone, other things,

2280
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,880
that can feed back on to the genome.

2281
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,420
So these could be epigenomic effects

2282
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:55,740
or onto the placenta itself,

2283
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:57,660
so that there's a higher probability

2284
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,530
in subsequent pregnancies

2285
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,930
that offspring will
self-report as homosexual.

2286
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:05,070
So it's a fascinating area of biology.

2287
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:06,540
And as you've noticed today,

2288
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,220
none of this deals with

2289
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:10,960
the current controversies around gender

2290
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,020
and how many genders and sex, et cetera

2291
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,420
That's a separate conversation that is

2292
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,290
by definition grounded
in the kind of concepts

2293
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:19,750
we've been talking about today

2294
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,440
and needs to take place,

2295
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,820
taking into consideration

2296
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:26,240
all of the aspects of sex
and the effects of hormones,

2297
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,610
both on the body, on the brain.

2298
01:33:28,610 --> 01:33:30,030
We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord,

2299
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:32,160
but we will in the next episode.

2300
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,740
But we can just say on the
brain and the periphery,

2301
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:37,230
early effects, late effects,

2302
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:40,180
acute effects, meaning
effects that are very fast

2303
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,270
of levels of hormones going up or down.

2304
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:44,400
Something that absolutely happens during

2305
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,380
and across the menstrual cycle.

2306
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,297
As well as long-term effects

2307
01:33:48,297 --> 01:33:51,750
like the effects of these
hormones on gene expression.

2308
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,870
So today, as always,

2309
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:55,510
we weren't able to cover

2310
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:59,670
all things related to sex and hormones

2311
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:02,860
and sexual differentiation or development.

2312
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,170
There's no way we could.

2313
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:06,360
But we have covered a lot of material.

2314
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:10,390
We talked about some effects
of environmental toxins.

2315
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,950
We talked about potential
effects of cell phone radiation.

2316
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:15,740
Something I never thought
that I would be talking about,

2317
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,410
especially not in a podcast.

2318
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:19,450
But for which there are
interesting emerging data.

2319
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:21,800
We talked about considerations about

2320
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,610
Evening Primrose Oil and
its estrogenic effects.

2321
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:27,180
About Creatine and its pro DHT effects.

2322
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,190
About cannabis, alcohol.

2323
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:31,810
About plants exerting warfare on animals

2324
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:33,210
by increasing aromatase.

2325
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:35,200
The conversion of
testosterone to estrogen.

2326
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,410
We talked about hyenas
with giant clitoris's.

2327
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:40,240
And we talked about moles that can revert

2328
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,560
from having ovaries to testicles.

2329
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,530
And throughout this Costello
has been snoring nonstop.

2330
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:48,040
He missed all of it.

2331
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,340
Although he might be
learning it in his sleep

2332
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,860
for all I know.

2333
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,010
And I do understand it's
a lot of information,

2334
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:56,330
a lot of detail as always.

2335
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:57,360
I just want to remind you,

2336
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,100
you don't have to absorb
all the information at once.

2337
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,779
Next episode, we are
going to be talking about

2338
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:06,894
the science of sex, the
verb, actual reproduction.

2339
01:35:06,894 --> 01:35:07,920
We're also going to be talking about

2340
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,730
effects of hormones on
various aspects of behavior

2341
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:14,170
and ways to modulate hormones,

2342
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:18,796
through the use of
behavior, supplementation.

2343
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:22,050
Also we'll touch on diet
and nutrition a bit.

2344
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,110
And we're going to talk about

2345
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:26,180
interactions between
those things and behavior,

2346
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:28,280
as they relate to important themes

2347
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,960
like sex and reproduction.

2348
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,320
Like workplace performance.

2349
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,900
Like motivation and
drive and even anxiety.

2350
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,560
There's a very interesting
relationship between

2351
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:42,400
hormones and anxiety and the
desire to explore novelty.

2352
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,690
So just to remember as we go forward that,

2353
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:48,790
hormones affect behavior and
behavior affects hormones.

2354
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:49,790
But that doesn't mean that

2355
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:51,050
cutting off your index finger

2356
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:53,170
will increase your testosterone.

2357
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:55,980
Many of you have asked how you
can help support the podcast.

2358
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,740
And we thank you for the question.

2359
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,070
There are several ways to do that.

2360
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:01,130
The first one is to subscribe on YouTube.

2361
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,080
If you haven't subscribed to
the YouTube channel already,

2362
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,330
please do so.

2363
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:06,060
As well, please hit the subscribe button.

2364
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:08,440
So you're sure not to
miss any of the episodes.

2365
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,540
We do release episodes every Monday,

2366
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,440
but we also occasionally
release short clips in between.

2367
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,120
As well, if you could subscribe

2368
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,760
on Apple and or Spotify,

2369
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:18,840
that's very helpful.

2370
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,550
And on Apple you have the opportunity

2371
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:22,710
to leave us up to a five star review

2372
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:24,410
and to leave a comment.

2373
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:27,290
On YouTube, please do leave
us comments and suggestions

2374
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,610
for future episodes.

2375
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:30,140
We really appreciate the feedback

2376
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,250
and we appreciate those suggestions.

2377
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:35,150
Also ask us any questions
you have about the material.

2378
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:37,820
Those questions help
guide our office hours,

2379
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,470
this discussion about your questions

2380
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,890
that we hold from time to time,

2381
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:43,460
as well as inform future content.

2382
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:45,530
Also, if you could tell
people about the podcast.

2383
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:48,080
Please tell your family,
your friends, your coworkers

2384
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,490
anyone that you think might
benefit from the material.

2385
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:52,740
That really helps us get the word out.

2386
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,897
As well, if you're
interested in supplements.

2387
01:36:54,897 --> 01:36:56,600
We've partnered with Thorne.

2388
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,528
T-H-O-R-N-E.

2389
01:36:58,528 --> 01:37:00,250
And we've partnered with Thorne because,

2390
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,440
Thorne has the highest level of stringency

2391
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:04,160
with respect to the ingredients

2392
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,850
that they put in their products.

2393
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:09,350
As well as the precise
amounts of those contents.

2394
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:10,880
You know, a lot of
supplement brands out there

2395
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,530
claim to have X amount of some supplement,

2396
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:15,560
but then when people have measured

2397
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,030
the amount in capsules and tablets,

2398
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:18,170
it's turned out to be very different.

2399
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,570
Thorne is very precise about this.

2400
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:23,190
They partnered with important
and stringent institutions

2401
01:37:23,190 --> 01:37:25,300
like the Mayo Clinic, all
the major sports teams.

2402
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,330
So that's why we partnered with Thorne.

2403
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:29,200
If you want to try any
of Thorne's products,

2404
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,200
if you want to see what I take

2405
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,670
you can go to Thorne that's

2406
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:34,660
thorne.com/u/huberman

2407
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,000
And if you do that you can see

2408
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,100
any of the products that I take.

2409
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,540
You can get 20% off any of those.

2410
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:43,840
As well as 20% off any
of the other products

2411
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,090
that Thorne makes.

2412
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:48,760
So that's thorne.com/u/huberman.

2413
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,500
Please also check out our sponsors.

2414
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,700
Check out the sponsor links.

2415
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:54,450
That's perhaps the best way to support us.

2416
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:56,100
And of course, I want to point out,

2417
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,190
that any of the ways that support us,

2418
01:37:58,190 --> 01:37:59,480
whether or not they are cost-free

2419
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,980
like subscribing and leaving comments

2420
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:03,230
or whether or not you're
interested in the products

2421
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:05,880
that I've referred to, those all help us.

2422
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,940
And so we really appreciate it.

2423
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:09,570
So once again, I want to thank you

2424
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:12,190
for embarking on this
journey through neuroscience

2425
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:15,180
and today neuroendocrinology with me.

2426
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,883
And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

2427
01:38:17,883 --> 01:38:20,466
