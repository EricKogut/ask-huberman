00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,420
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,930
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,389
for everyday life.

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,490
[guitar music]

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,290
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,700
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,850
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,110
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,110
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,960
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,980
and science-related tools
to the general public.

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,270
In keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,280
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,473
Our first sponsor is Four Sigmatic.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,510
Four Sigmatic is a wellness company

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,100
that makes mushroom coffee.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,230
And if you're asking yourself,

18
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,430
why would you want to
put mushrooms in coffee?

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,390
First of all, let me tell you

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,040
these are not psychedelic
mushrooms and no,

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,070
the coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,700
The coffee is delicious

23
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,930
and you don't taste mushrooms at all.

24
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,020
I know this because I've been
using Four Sigmatic coffee

25
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,960
and been stocking it in my
laboratory for several years now

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,930
long before I ever had the podcast

27
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,140
or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor.

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,560
The two kinds of mushrooms that
are in Four Sigmatic coffee

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,270
our lion's mane and chaga mushrooms,

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,103
both of which have been shown

31
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:10,490
to have a slight anxiolytic
effect to reduce anxiety.

32
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,310
And lion's mane has also been shown

33
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,950
in several studies to lower the symptoms

34
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,480
of depression just slightly.

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,170
Although I wouldn't consider
it a treatment for depression,

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,680
that's an attractive benefit,

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,050
as well as have some effect at
offsetting cognitive decline.

38
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,180
Albeit slightly, the effects were real

39
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,650
in the studies that I've found.

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,240

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,363
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Blinkist.

48
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,840
Blinkist is an app that has thousands

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,550
of nonfiction books condensed
down to just 15 minutes

50
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,520
of key takeaways that you
can read or listen to.

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm a big reader and I'm a
big consumer of nonfiction.

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,840
And most of the time I consume books

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,400
in their traditional form like a book

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,419
where you flip the pages and so forth.

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,680
I also listen to full length audio books.

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,640
However, over time we know
that we forget lots of things.

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,870
And even though sometimes I think

58
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,340
I got all the critical
information from a book,

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,240
when I listen to Blinkist and
I get the 15-minute rundown,

60
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,860
either an audio or in written form,

61
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,980
what I find is there key points
that oftentimes I missed.

62
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,020
And so it's a great way for
me to both jog my memory

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,300
and to bring forward ideas

64
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,410
that I hadn't considered previously.

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,900
They have thousands of nonfiction titles

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,360
and some really terrific
ones in the science category.

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,110
For example, David
Eagleman's book "Livewired"

68
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,880
which came out recently as a
book I read in full length form

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,957
and I've listened to the
Blinkist version of it as well.

70
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:50,180
"Livewired" is a book
about neuroplasticity.

71
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,470
The brain's ability to change
in response to experience.

72
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,340
I get so many questions and requests

73
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,270
for books about neuroplasticity.

74
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,550
In my opinion, "Livewired"
is the most recent

75
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,380
and up-to-date and the best one to date.

76
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,440
So that's there.

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,690
David Sinclair's book "Lifespan."

78
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,240
David, as many of you know,

79
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,787
is a professor of genetics
at Harvard Medical School.

80
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,950
"Lifespan" is this terrific
book about aging as a disease

81
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,570
and the future and present
of longevity treatments.

82
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,910
Very interesting book.

83
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,220
As well as Matt Walker's
book, "Why We Sleep."

84
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,540
Matt, of course, is a
professor at UC Berkeley

85
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,500
and "Why We Sleep" is a terrific book

86
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,980
about why we sleep, the
science of sleeping,

87
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,650
and things you can do
to improve your sleep.

88
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,410
All of those are on Blinkist.

89
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,250
But with Blinkist you get unlimited access

90
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,850

102
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,973
This episode is also
brought to us by Munk Pack.

103
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,720
Munk Pack is a company that
makes keto-friendly snacks

104
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,100
that taste incredible

105
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,040
but have just one gram of sugar or less.

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
As I've said before on this
podcast, I am not in ketosis.

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,079
I'm not ketogenic.

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,020
I don't advocate or follow
any one particular diet.

109
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,970
For me, what works is to fast
in the early part of the day

110
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,610
and to eat low carb and
keto-ish throughout the day.

111
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,440
That's for alertness and attention.

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,020
So I can work and focus

113
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,380
and I don't feel sluggish or brain fog.

114
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,090
And then at night and in the evening

115
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,140
is when I tend to eat my carbohydrates

116
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,710
to aid the transition to sleep.

117
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,210
That's what works for me.

118
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,630
Munk Pack bars are a terrific snack

119
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,150
whether or not you're keto all the time,

120
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,020
whether or not you're low carb,

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,370
or even if you're not, they
are absolutely delicious.

122
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,780
And I don't say that lightly.

123
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,890
I'm not a big fan of bars in general.

124
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,350
Most bars to me tastes like
a combination of, you know,

125
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,350
a metal bumper mixed with some cardboard

126
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,170
and some lawn trimmings
and some artificial sugar.

127
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,930
Munk Pack bars, when they were sent to me,

128
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,000
I was like, all right, I'll try them.

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,833
I tried it.

130
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,460
Like, uh-oh, this is a problem

131
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,170
'cause I liked them very, very much.

132
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,610
And when I say it's a problem,
it really is a problem.

133
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,700
I actually keep the Munk
Pack boxes in my basement

134
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,570
so that I don't tear
through them all at once.

135
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,420
I'm a huge fan of the
caramel sea salt flavor.

136
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,253
It's delicious.

137
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,240
Just talking about it
makes me hungry for one.

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,360
But they also have sea salt,

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,910
dark chocolate, peanut
butter dark chocolate.

140
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,050
They're terrific.

141
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,410
In addition to being keto-friendly,

142
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,640
they're also gluten-free, plant-based,

143
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,900
non-GMO, no soy, trans fat,

144
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,880
sugar alcohols or artificial colors.

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,420
So all the bad stuff that you don't want.

146
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,070
And as I mentioned before, they're keto,

147
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,470
less than one gram of sugar.

148
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,580
If you want to try Munk Pack,
you can go to munkpack.com.

155
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,770
This month, we've been
talking all about hormones,

156
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,870
which are these absolutely
incredible chemicals

157
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,690
in our brain and body.

158
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,560
They impact our entire lifespan.

159
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,130
So from the time that we are in the womb,

160
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,500
they're controlling the development

161
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,540
of our brain and our bodies.

162
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,460
After we are born,
they're still controlling

163
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,380
the development of our brain and bodies.

164
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,530
And I did say development,

165
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,250
and that's because, contrary
to what most people think,

166
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,020
development lasts the entire lifespan.

167
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,080
From the time you're conceived
until the time you die,

168
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,760
you are developing, you are changing.

169
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,640
And hormones are constantly
updating and changing

170
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,720
the different functions of your body.

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,060
They have two major kinds of effects.

172
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,640
One are immediate effects,
so they can actually bind to

173
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,000
or kind of park in parking spots on cells

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,910
and impact all sorts of things

175
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,900
like the growth of cells, et cetera.

176
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,340
They also can control gene expression.

177
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,240
This is the way that
hormones during puberty

178
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,360
control body hair growth
and breast development

179
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,160
and growth of muscles and limbs and height

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,140
and all sorts of things.

181
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,630
They are incredible.

182
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,210
We've talked about
testosterone and estrogen.

183
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,760
We talked about insulin and glucagon

184
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,020
and some of the other things.

185
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,790
Today, we are going to
talk about metabolism.

186
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,690
Mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone

187
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,320
and growth hormone and some
other related pathways.

188
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,880
I'm going to explain to you the logic

189
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,180
of how thyroid hormone
and growth hormone work.

190
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,360
It will become obvious
why I've paired thyroid

191
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,810
and growth hormone together
in the same episode.

192
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,500
And I will of course talk about tools

193
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,730
that you can use to elevate
or reduce thyroid hormone.

194
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,610
There are cases where people
want to reduce thyroid hormone.

195
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,180
I will talk about tools that you can use

196
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,170
to elevate growth hormone.

197
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,550
There are rare cases where people

198
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,940
want to reduce growth hormone.

199
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,400
Most people are interested
in increasing growth hormone.

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,780
So today is going to be
rich with information,

201
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,020
rich with actionable tools.

202
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,080
And as always, the idea is to spell out

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,290
an organizational logic
so you can come away

204
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,630
from this episode and in fact

205
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,810
the entire month on hormones,

206
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,230
really understanding at some level

207
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,930
what these things we call
hormones are and how they work.

208
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,050
And that's really to arm
you to encounter information

209
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,690
going forward, whether
or not it comes from me

210
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,440
or from somebody else, a book or a course,

211
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,110
someplace else online to
make sense of how to work

212
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,050
with these incredible
chemicals we call hormones.

213
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,010
Before we begin to talk about
thyroid and growth hormone

214
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,539
and how our metabolism works
and how to control metabolism,

215
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,099
I want to answer a few
questions that I received

216
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,409
from you from the audience.

217
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,279
Every once in a while,

218
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,570
someone will send me a
quite earnest question

219
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,170
about something they saw on the internet.

220
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,860
And one of the things I've
heard about quite a bit

221
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,660
in the last couple of
weeks as we've been talking

222
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,160
about hormones and food
intake and how those interact

223
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,670
is this question of are certain foods

224
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,680
particularly good for
certain organs of the body?

225
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,930
And can that be predicted

226
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,180
on the basis of the shape of those foods?

227
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,860
So first of all, I want to
acknowledge the question

228
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,360
as a valid one, because I see this

229
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,630
every once in a while out there.

230
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,840
People will say, well, you know,

231
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,770
walnuts are in the shape of the brain

232
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,430
and therefore they are good
for your brain or, you know,

233
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,150
a particular fruit like the
beet often looks like a heart

234
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,890
and it's good for your heart.

235
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,440
And I certainly invite
questions of all kinds,

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,210
provided they're sincere questions.

237
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,210
However, I am not aware
of any science whatsoever

238
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,830
supporting the idea that
the shape of a given food

239
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,730
or object for that matter is relevant

240
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,520
to its functional role in the
body in reference to biology.

241
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,670
Now, beets contain something

242
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,710
that we're going to talk about today.

243
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,410
They contain a substance called arginine,

244
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,810
which actually can control the dilation

245
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,800
of blood vessels and arteries.

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,763
So it has some relationship
to heart and heart health.

247
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,400
Walnuts contain various fatty acids

248
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,220
that maybe, I want to underscore maybe,

249
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,230
beneficial for certain
aspects of brain health

250
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,010
but there's no evidence whatsoever

251
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,970
that the shape of the
food itself is relevant.

252
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,760
And, you know, I think what's happened is,

253
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,930
is that people have gone out there

254
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,370
and found foods that
contain certain substances

255
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,130
like carrots and vitamin A

256
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,530
or walnuts and particular fatty acids

257
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,960
or beets and arginine.

258
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,080
And they've selected the foods

259
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,410
that happen to be in
the shape of the thing,

260
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,300
the organ that the particular
substance like vitamin A

261
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,580
or fatty acids and so forth
might benefit or support.

262
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,370
But of course, there are
many, many other sources

263
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,620
of these nutrients that
don't come from walnuts

264
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,110
or from beets or from carrots.

265
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,660
And so I guess the short way to put it

266
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,390
is that the idea that
the shape of some food

267
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,010
is an indication of
whether or not that food

268
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,010
would be healthy for a
particular organ in the body

269
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,640
is absolutely unfounded.

270
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,620
I don't know of any evidence for it

271
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,170
and I'm not out to quash
anybody's great love

272
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,003
of these foods.

273
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:18,030
I enjoy all the foods I just described,

274
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,520
but the shape of things
in the physical universe

275
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,650
bears very little, if any, relevance

276
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,690
to the nutrients that it contains

277
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,560
and therefore the organs that it supports.

278
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,400
So thank you for your question

279
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,074
but if you see that out there,

280
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,650
I don't even think you
need to tell the person

281
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,930
who's putting that information
out into the world.

282
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,640
I would just, you know, back away slowly.

283
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,500
One other thing, before we
move into today's material,

284
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,380
last episode, I talked about the problems

285
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,930
with emulsifiers in highly processed foods

286
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,120
and the way that they can strip

287
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,870
the mucosal lining of the gut.

288
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,090
And they can limit the
signaling of hormones like CCK

289
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,180
that can signal to the brain satiety,

290
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,310
the signal to stop eating.

291
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,410
And then we got into a discussion

292
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,530
about artificial sweeteners

293
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,020
and I threw out Stevia as
an artificial sweetener.

294
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,950
And several people
reached out to correct me

295
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,080
that Stevia is not an
artificial sweetener,

296
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,040
it is a noncaloric sweetener,
and you are correct.

297
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,970
I lumped artificial and
noncaloric sweeteners together.

298
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,180
And thanks to many of you that
also sent me some references.

299
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,220
It does not appear that
Stevia can negatively impact

300
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,310
the gut microbiome.

301
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,960
It does seem unique among
noncaloric sweeteners.

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,900
There are probably others out there.

303
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,940
The other thing that we
discussed is how Stevia

304
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,160
can lead to slight
increases in blood glucose

305
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,960
but can also improve insulin
management just slightly,

306
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,840
probably cancels to zero
in terms of its impact

307
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,860
on blood glucose,

308
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,190
provided it's not at concentrations

309
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,370
that are super, super sweet.

310
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,480
Ingestion of anything that's very sweet,

311
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,130
whether or not contains calories
or not, artificial or not,

312
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,030
will create an insulin response.

313
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,730
In fact, just walking past a bakery

314
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,210
and smelling delicious baked goods

315
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,170
can increase your insulin secretion.

316
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,300
And so we just want to point that out.

317
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,990
Thank you for the information

318
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,270
and the references that you found.

319
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,530
Please send additional
ones if you do find them.

320
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,490
And I appreciate that you
allow me to make corrections

321
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,690
every once in a while I must speak here

322
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,120
and the opportunity to make corrections

323
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,770
keeps us all on the same page.

324
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,010
And please do keep any
feedback that you have

325
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,803
about particular things I
cover here coming my way.

326
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,710
There is so much interest in metabolism.

327
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,690
We hear about having a
high or a low metabolism.

328
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,920
There are some people out there

329
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,190
who would like to reduce their metabolism.

330
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,310
They simply can't eat enough
to maintain their weight.

331
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,840
Most people, however, struggle
with the opposite issue.

332
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,644
They struggle to maintain a healthy weight

333
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:53,090
and/or their metabolism is too low.

334
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,510
Now, there are a variety of reasons

335
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,200
why metabolism can be low.

336
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,280
Today, we are going to
talk about two hormones,

337
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,470
thyroid hormone and its related pathways

338
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,790
and growth hormone and
it's related pathways,

339
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,570
which arguably are the two hormones

340
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,100
and two systems in the body
that are most significant

341
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,083
for setting your overall
level of metabolism.

342
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,290
Before we dive into those,

343
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,900
I just want to cover a little
bit of what metabolism is.

344
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,960
And I want to talk about
which organs in your body

345
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,400
use the most energy.

346
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,520
So metabolism is the
consumption of energy,

347
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,860
not necessarily eating,

348
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,110
but it's the use of energy
in the cells of the body

349
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,660
for growth of tissues,
for repair of tissues,

350
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,820
and also just for day-to-day
maintenance of function.

351
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,450
A good example of maintenance of function

352
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,730
would be your brain.

353
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,840
Most of your metabolic needs,

354
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,970
your so-called basal or
resting metabolic needs

355
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,840
are for your brain, for thinking.

356
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,720
If you were to just sit in a bed all day

357
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,830
and do nothing but think,

358
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,600
that consumes about 75%
of your metabolic needs.

359
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,850
Now, there's also moving around.

360
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,580
If you have a job that
requires a lot of heavy labor

361
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,440
or lifting things or you're a new parent

362
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,520
and you're carrying kids around

363
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,660
and you're going up and down the stairs

364
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,950
or back and forth to the refrigerator

365
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,120
for formula, et cetera,

366
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,810
well then you're burning more
energy, burning more calories.

367
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,450
But even if you are
very physically active,

368
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,990
unless you're an ultra
marathoner or a marathoner,

369
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,720
chances are that 75%
of your metabolic needs

370
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,560
are coming just from your brain.

371
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,420
And that's because neurons
consume a lot of energy.

372
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,260
Neurons, of course, are just
the nerve cells of your brain.

373
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,690
So these two hormones, thyroid
hormone and growth hormone,

374
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,920
we think of as related to
metabolism of things in the body,

375
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,970
keeping body fat low, and
keeping muscles strong,

376
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,830
and tendons strong and
repairing themselves, et cetera,

377
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,020
but they are also key for brain function,

378
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,330
for the ability to
maintain cognitive function

379
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,810
throughout the lifespan.

380
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,990
So the big theme I'd like to introduce

381
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:03,400
is that metabolism isn't
just about losing weight

382
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,930
but having a high metabolism,

383
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,660
provided it's not too high, is great.

384
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,600
It means that you will
have more lean tissue,

385
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,847
more bone and muscle and
less adipose tissue, fat.

386
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,120
And we know that that's healthy.

387
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,360
How much fat and how much muscle?

388
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,290
Well, that varies,

389
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,220
and the numbers on this
are always shifting.

390
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,220
But in general, muscle
and its related tissues

391
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,860
burns more energy than
does adipose tissue or fat.

392
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,470
And the water in your body
doesn't consume any energy.

393
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,030
So metabolism can be increased

394
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,380
simply by adding muscle to your body

395
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,540
and reducing fat or adjusting
the ratio of the two.

396
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,520
But regardless, even if
you're not interested

397
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,590
in changing body composition,
these two hormones,

398
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,160
thyroid hormone and growth hormone,

399
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,560
are super important for
metabolism of all kinds,

400
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,900
including tissue repair after injury,

401
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,720
including maintaining cognitive function

402
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,700
and well-being and the ability
to think clearly as you age,

403
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,720
offsetting dementia and so forth.

404
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,720
So the big theme here really
includes the previous episodes.

405
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:06,069
You don't have to have seen those episodes

406
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,119
but for the last three
episodes and today as well,

407
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,479
we've been talking about hormones,

408
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,390
these substances that are
released from one location

409
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,180
in the body that go and act
other locations in the body.

410
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,319
I'm going to tell you how that works

411
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,899
for thyroid and growth hormone.

412
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,609
But now that you've heard
about testosterone and estrogen

413
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,029
and you're going to hear about
thyroid and growth hormone,

414
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,030
I want you to realize that
there's a repeating logic.

415
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,570
First of all, there are
neurons in your brain

416
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,020
in an area called the hypothalamus,

417
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,200
which just means it's
below the thalamus, hypo.

418
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,360
It sits at the base of your brain,

419
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
in the front, it's part of the forebrain.

420
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,190
So it's more or less above
the roof of your mouth,

421
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,020
maybe about a centimeter or so,

422
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,050
and then about a centimeter
forward in most people.

423
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,847
And neurons in the
hypothalamus release hormones

424
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,300
that are called releasing hormones.

425
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,980
So we've talked in previous episodes

426
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,610
about, for instance,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

427
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,190
So those are a little
neurons that then signal

428
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,290
another brain area called the pituitary

429
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,890
to release other hormones.

430
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,070
Today, we're going to see this again.

431
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,020
In the brain, you have neurons
that release thyrotropin

432
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,610
or thyroid-releasing hormone.

433
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,860
You also have growth
hormone-releasing hormone.

434
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,780
So anytime you hear releasing,

435
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,220
chances are those are neurons
that are in your brain

436
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,250
and they extend little wires we call axons

437
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,110
into your pituitary and the pituitary

438
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,570
releases a bunch of hormones
into the bloodstream.

439
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,410
And the pituitary releases things

440
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,580
that most often have the
name of stimulating hormone

441
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,700
because they stimulate organs.

442
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,440
So in keeping with the
theme of thyroid hormone,

443
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,540
you have thyroid-releasing
hormone in the brain,

444
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,630
tells the pituitary to release
thyroid-stimulating hormone

445
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,570
and then the thyroid, which
we'll talk about in a moment,

446
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,470
releases thyroid hormones.

447
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,020
In the testosterone and estrogen episode,

448
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,550
we talked about how you have
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

449
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,370
there's the releasing
again, up in the brain.

450
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,100
Remember, releasing hormone
comes from the brain.

451
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,460
Then you had things
like luteinizing hormone

452
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,050
and follicle-stimulating hormone,

453
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,090
which were in the pituitary
and those traveled

454
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,520
to the ovaries or the testes

455
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,740
and acted on those tissues, okay?

456
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,740
So please try and embed this logic.

457
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,540
If you hear the word releasing hormone,

458
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,710
it's coming from the brain,
and that makes it actionable

459
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,610
in certain ways that
we'll return to later.

460
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,800
In addition, the pituitary is letting go

461
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,380
of all these hormones into the bloodstream

462
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,520
that are stimulating different tissues.

463
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,710
So for thyroid, it's
thyroid-stimulating hormone.

464
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,900
And then it goes to the thyroid.

465
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,210
And the thyroid is a little
butterfly-shaped gland

466
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,240
that's right around the Adam's apple.

467
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,580
If you want to see yours, not directly

468
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,800
'cause it's got skin over it,

469
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,120
what you would do is
you'd take a sip of water,

470
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,270
you'd look in the mirror
and you'd swallow.

471
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,210
And the thing that moves up
and down, that is your thyroid.

472
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,130
Now, some people call it your Adam's apple

473
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,820
because it sits right near
this protrusion in the trachea,

474
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,670
which is the Adam's apple.

475
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,360
No matter, whether or
not you're male, female,

476
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,550
or regardless of what your
chromosomal background is,

477
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,450
everyone has an Adam's apple.

478
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,100
It tends to be more pronounced in people

479
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,380
that got a surge of testosterone
early in development

480
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,650
because it has a testosterone
sensitivity to it.

481
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,740
And that actually controls the timbre,

482
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,230
the so-called deepness of the voice.

483
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,570
So the thyroid gland sits right there

484
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,560
and it's got four little bumps behind it

485
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,010
called the parathyroid gland.

486
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,500
And it releases two
hormones into the blood

487
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,800
to stimulate different
tissues and their metabolism.

488
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,430
And those hormones are called T4 and T3.

489
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,640
So if this is already sounding

490
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,140
like a lot of information,
it's really easy, I promise.

491
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,530
Releasing hormone comes from the brain.

492
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,610
Stimulating hormone
comes from the pituitary.

493
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,270
And in this case, we're
talking about the thyroid,

494
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,040
binding up that stimulating
hormone and saying, oh,

495
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,873
I need to release something.

496
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,430
And it releases T4 and T3.

497
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,263
And guess what?

498
00:20:53,263 --> 00:20:55,060
You can basically forget about T4.

499
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,150
T4, it's not completely
inactive, it has some roles,

500
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,040
but T3 is the one that's
more or less active.

501
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,050
Now, what does thyroid hormone do?

502
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,500
A lot of people think, oh, thyroid,

503
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,920
it's like metabolism and
people who are hyperthyroidal

504
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,640
have bulging eyes and are real thin

505
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,880
and people who have
hypothyroid are overweight

506
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,290
and their eyes are like are, you know,

507
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,420
half closed or something.

508
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,840
And indeed thyroid hormone controls

509
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,993
a lot of the features of
the face and the eyes.

510
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:25,170
And it can control amounts of
adipose tissue and so forth.

511
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,170
But the main role of
thyroid hormone, of T3,

512
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,870
is to promote metabolism.

513
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,960
And that doesn't just mean
the consumption of energy,

514
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,900
it means the utilization of energy,

515
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,290
including the buildup of tissues.

516
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,700
So it acts on all sorts of
target tissues in the body.

517
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,370
It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,

518
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,100
it acts on the cartilage,
it acts on the bone.

519
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,460
And it's not just
involved in using energy,

520
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,030
it's also converting energy.

521
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,780
I do realize I said that twice.

522
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,750
It's involved in taking fats

523
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,010
and breaking them down into fatty acids

524
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,480
and converting those into ATP,

525
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,800
which is an important thing
for cells to use energy.

526
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,220
It's also involved in taking sugars

527
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,170
and turning those into energy.

528
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,600
And yes, it goes to adipose tissue to fat.

529
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,490
We have different kinds of fat
that we'll talk about today

530
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,580
but it goes to white fat

531
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,960
and it liberates or helps
liberate some of the fats

532
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,630
from those fat cells
and use them for energy.

533
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,000
And this is why higher thyroid

534
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
is associated with leaner bodies.

535
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,430
Lower thyroid is associated
with less lean bodies.

536
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,620
So one thing that's absolutely
key and is actionable,

537
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,400
we're right there already in
discussing tools is iodine.

538
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,330
Iodine comes from things
in the ocean, right?

539
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,190
And here are a couple of
interesting facts about iodine.

540
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,660
And then we'll talk about whether or not

541
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,010
you should be supplementing iodine or not.

542
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,563
First of all, iodine is most common

543
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,080
in sea salt, in kelp and in seaweed.

544
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,020
And most people can get enough iodine

545
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,773
from the food they eat and/or
the table salt they consume.

546
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,640
Almost all table salt
from all over the world,

547
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,103
regardless of where you
are, contains iodine.

548
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,820
The thyroid needs iodine

549
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,990
in order to produce thyroid hormone.

550
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,000
And you need sufficient
levels of thyroid hormone,

551
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,210
not too much, but you need it.

552
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,580
So chances are you are
getting enough iodine.

553
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,200
Although, you might not,

554
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,610
especially those of you
following a particularly,

555
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,070
quote, unquote, clean diet,

556
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,330
might not be getting enough iodine.

557
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,750
Here's the deal with iodine.

558
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,340
Iodine combines with an amino acid

559
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,430
that we've talked about
before called L-tyrosine.

560
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,710
L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.

561
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,880
There are some plant-based
sources as well.

562
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,770
It is the precursor to dopamine.

563
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,220
But in the thyroid,
iodine combines or works

564
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,220
with L-tyrosine to produce T3
and T4, the thyroid hormone.

565
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,460
So you absolutely need sufficient iodine,

566
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,920
you need sufficient L-tyrosine,

567
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,230
and then you also need something else,

568
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,270
which is called selenium.

569
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,780
And we'll talk about selenium in a moment.

570
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,940
So there's a condition that shows up

571
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,490
in little pockets in the world.

572
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,490
It's not super common, meaning
it's not very widespread,

573
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,050
but in certain areas that
are far away from the ocean,

574
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,160
at one point, this was historically

575
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,030
in the Midwestern states
of the United States,

576
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,550
in some mountain regions
of other countries,

577
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,550
in some areas of Africa that
were far from the ocean,

578
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,290
people would get extremely
swollen bulges in their necks.

579
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,540
And this was called goiter.

580
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,130
And the reason they were
getting those swollen bulges

581
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,720
is because the thyroid
itself was hypertrophying.

582
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,660
It was growing in an attempt
to churn out more thyroid.

583
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,760
And because it was getting a lot

584
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,863
of stimulating hormone from the pituitary.

585
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,180
And I don't want to go
too far off track here

586
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,860
but as you recall,

587
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,700
the brain and the pituitary
are paying attention

588
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,687
in a cellular sense to the
levels of hormones in the blood.

589
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,780
And when those hormones get too high,

590
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,330
they shut off the stimulating hormone,

591
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,780
they shut down the signal to make more,

592
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,060
kind of like a thermostat.

593
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,820
When the levels are too low,

594
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,900
like there's not enough
testosterone in the bloodstream

595
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,020
or there's not enough estrogen,

596
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,170
the brain will continue to push
out the signal to make more.

597
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,670
Similarly, if there's not
enough thyroid circulating

598
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,280
or there's not enough
iodine to make thyroid,

599
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,940
therefore not enough
thyroid hormone circulating,

600
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,530
the thyroid gland itself
is not getting shut down.

601
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,090
There's tons of stimulating hormone

602
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,510
and releasing hormone
coming from the brain,

603
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,620
like release, release, release,

604
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,057
and there's no way they
can make thyroid hormone

605
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:48,460
and so the gland just gets
bigger and bigger and bigger.

606
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,920
And so people get goiter.

607
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,260
This is one of the reasons why
table salt has iodine in it.

608
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,230
Although there are other foods

609
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,460
that have iodine in it as well.

610
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,390
So how much iodine do you need?

611
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,440
Well, you don't need a whole lot.

612
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,170
Some people who are hypothyroidal might,

613
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,130
and I want to emphasize might,

614
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,820
you absolutely should talk to your doctor.

615
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,010
This is a serious matter.

616
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,140
Anytime you're talking about hormones

617
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,900
or manipulating levels of thyroid,

618
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,730
you absolutely want to
talk to your doctor.

619
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,370
Some people benefit from
supplementing iodine.

620
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,960
It is contained in most salts.

621
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,720
It's in Himalayan salt,
not always, but often.

622
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,990
I know these days, there's
a lot of excitement

623
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,040
about pink salts and sea salts and what,

624
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,920
you know, they're kind
of artisan salt thing

625
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,450
has kind of taken off in the
foodie land, which is great.

626
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,420
Some of them are actually quite tasty.

627
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,240
You can just take it directly
if you like the taste of salt.

628
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,290
But iodine can be supplemented

629
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,970
through things like kelp and
seaweed and kelp tablets.

630
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,100
Now, if you are hyperthyroidal,
you make too much thyroid,

631
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,820
that actually can be a problem.

632
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,300
So really, the best way to figure this out

633
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,100
is to get your blood levels
tested of thyroid hormone.

634
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,010
But there's so much iodine in the ocean

635
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,550
that believe it or not people
that live near the coast

636
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,570
can actually just absorb
it through the air,

637
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,360
just by breathing ocean air.

638
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,500
So that gives you a sense
of just how little iodine

639
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,700
you actually need to
consume in food or in salt.

640
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,290
So if you're within a
few miles of the ocean

641
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,760
or you visit the ocean from time to time,

642
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,620
you're probably getting plenty.

643
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,550
It does have to come
together, as I mentioned,

644
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,910
with L-tyrosine,

645
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,853
and this is why foods
that contain L-tyrosine,

646
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,993
and provided that you have
sufficient iodine in your diet,

647
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,030
and if you have sufficient
selenium in your diet,

648
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,640
does serve to increase your metabolism.

649
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,910
And that again is for the
growth and repair of tissues.

650
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,600
And that's really important.

651
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,550
It's not just about keeping
your metabolism high

652
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,950
so that you can be on
the leaner side of things

653
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,130
or adjust your body weight, excuse me,

654
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,800
your body composition
ratios the way you like.

655
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,080
Repair of injuries,
repair of brain tissue,

656
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,880
clearance of any damage from neurons,

657
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,480
clearance of any damage to the body

658
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,210
is also going to depend on thyroid.

659
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,870
Again, metabolism being this kind of rate

660
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,470
of fuel consumption and
use in the body, generally,

661
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,010
not just about body mass
indexes and things of that sort.

662
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,840
So let's talk about selenium
because it's really important.

663
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,810
And even though most
people are getting a lot

664
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,763
of sufficient iodine,

665
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,310
and most people are probably
getting enough L-tyrosine.

666
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,560
I'm guessing most people may
not be getting enough selenium

667
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,840
if their goal is to
increase thyroid hormone,

668
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,100
at least that's what the literature says.

669
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,520
Without going into the biochemistry,

670
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,160
selenium is important in order

671
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,830
for thyroid hormone to be made

672
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,000
because of the way that
it allows L-tyrosine

673
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,520
and iodine to interact.

674
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,150
And the thing is most people
aren't getting enough selenium

675
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,080
because they don't eat foods
that are high in selenium.

676
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,640
Now, how much selenium you need

677
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
will depend on where you live.

678
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,970
It actually varies country by country.

679
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,370
Some countries I found

680
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,180
say that you should get 100 micrograms,

681
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,590
some say 200, some say 155.

682
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,780
The average was about 155 micrograms,

683
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,380
the countries I looked at.

684
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,780
People who are trying to
increase thyroid levels

685
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,010
might want to consume more selenium.

686
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,550
And if you consume a vitamin, of course,

687
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,350
you want to make sure if it has selenium

688
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,920
that you're not overdoing it by consuming

689
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,120
a lot of selenium rich foods either.

690
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,380
But nonetheless, I think it's fair to say

691
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,970
that most people probably could do well

692
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,080
by ingesting slightly more
selenium than they currently are.

693
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,260
Although, of course,
always talk to your doctor.

694
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,080
Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion

695
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,470
of foods to get selenium from.

696
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,690
It has very high
concentrations of selenium.

697
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,640
In just six or eight Brazil nuts

698
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,420
contain something like 550
micrograms of selenium.

699
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,290
It's also present in fish.

700
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,970
So certain fish like yellowfin tuna,

701
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,180
although nowadays whenever
I mention tuna or shellfish,

702
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,890
which is the other rich
source of selenium,

703
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,660
people will tell me immediately

704
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,240
there are all sorts of issues around farm,

705
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,150
not farm, mercury, et cetera.

706
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,250
So I've never particularly
liked eating fish

707
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,650
'cause of the way it tastes.

708
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,780
So that's why I avoid it.

709
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,920
But for those of you that like it,

710
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,430
I'm sure you're much more skilled

711
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,610
in knowing which fish to buy
and which fish not to buy.

712
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,830
Ham, of all things,
contains a lot of selenium,

713
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,520
for whatever reason pork does.

714
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,260
I'm not a big consumer of pork.

715
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,760
Beef has some selenium,
but what's interesting

716
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,030
if you look at the sources,
you know, pork, beef,

717
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,640
turkey, chicken, cottage
cheese, eggs, brown rice,

718
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,070
what you want to understand
is that Brazil nuts,

719
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,980
six to eight Brazil nuts has
550 micrograms of selenium.

720
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,120
And all the other foods I mentioned

721
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,710
at much greater portion size

722
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,780
than equivalent to six
to eight Brazil nuts,

723
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,100
either by volume or by calories,

724
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,570
they have something like 30
to 50 micrograms of selenium.

725
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,850
So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,

726
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,450
I'm guessing most people aren't,

727
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,160
and you're not eating a
lot of animal based foods,

728
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,750
which I know many of you aren't,

729
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,900
then you're probably not
getting enough selenium.

730
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,350
And again, you can have
these levels measured

731
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,350
or you can just check what
you're consuming and figure out

732
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,860
whether or not you're meeting
the ration that you need

733
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,900
in order to get healthy levels of thyroid.

734
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,370
It is present in things
like mushrooms, but again,

735
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,630
in a bowl of mushrooms, you
know, what is the equivalent

736
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,610
to a bowl of mushroom is
12 micrograms of selenium.

737
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,540
And if the daily ration is
something in 100 to 200 range,

738
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,200
again, look it up for the area you are.

739
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,850
You can see really quickly
why even though things

740
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,040
like mushrooms and spinach
and milk and yogurt

741
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,100
and lentils and cashews,

742
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,380
and now we're into the vegetarian segment

743
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,040
of the list that I constructed,

744
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,770
you're probably not
getting enough selenium.

745
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,960
So it's kind of an interesting thing.

746
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,050
If you're an experimenter

747
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,160
and you get the clearance
from your doctor,

748
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,970
you could try increasing
your selenium levels

749
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,120
and see how that impacts your metabolism.

750
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,090
Again, Brazil nuts are probably
going to be the most direct way

751
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,050
to get sufficient selenium levels

752
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,200
but because levels are
so high in Brazil nuts,

753
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,700
it also means that you
could overdo it as well.

754
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,700
I'm not really aware of
what the consequences are

755
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,370
of getting too much selenium,
although you can get too much

756
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,490
of anything and I'm guessing
those consequences aren't good.

757
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,640
I also want to mention that for children,

758
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,710
their daily requirements
of selenium are much lower,

759
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,710
as low as 30 or 40 micrograms
for kids 14 years or younger.

760
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And in some areas, I really
want to underscore this,

761
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,140
the amount of selenium
that's recommended daily

762
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,090
is as low as 55 micrograms.

763
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,190
So it's not that you should be shooting

764
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,200
for thousands or even
high levels of hundreds

765
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,810
of micrograms of selenium.

766
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,310
And again, that's
micrograms, not milligrams.

767
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,640
So again, look into what you need

768
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,730
but if you're somebody who's interested

769
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,730
in keeping thyroid function
healthy and productive,

770
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,810
then you certainly want to make sure

771
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,950
you're getting enough iodine,

772
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,810
you're getting enough selenium

773
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,630
and you're getting enough L-tyrosine.

774
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,090
And it's interesting
when you start looking

775
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,980
at the various foods, especially
highly processed foods,

776
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,140
then you start to realize

777
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,560
that perhaps many people,
maybe you, are not.

778
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,160
Not incidentally, selenium
has some other effects

779
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,440
on health that can be quite positive.

780
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,200
And even though these
don't relate to thyroid

781
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,140
or growth hormone function specifically,

782
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,310
I think you might want to know about them,

783
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,390
given that we're on the topic of selenium.

784
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,720
The first is that there are three studies,

785
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,380
all of which showed very high efficacy

786
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,130
for reducing the risk of
something called preeclampsia,

787
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,560
excuse me, preeclampsia.

788
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,820
Preeclampsia is seizures that are related

789
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,600
to blood pressure issues during

790
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,240
or around the delivery of a new baby.

791
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,890
And actually, it's a rare-ish condition

792
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,410
but it actually can be quite deadly.

793
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,880
And so the fact that selenium is important

794
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,840
for offsetting preeclampsia
risk is interesting.

795
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,490
I don't know the exact mechanism

796
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,510
and I'm guessing there are
only a few of you out there

797
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,200
that are either pregnant or
thinking of conceiving soon,

798
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,490
but that's worth noting.

799
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,590
Obviously, anything related
to pregnancy or lactation,

800
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,770
especially talk to your doctor.

801
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,900
I'm guessing that selenium is probably

802
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,590
in a lot of prenatal formulas

803
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,570
but that's one clear benefit
of having sufficient selenium.

804
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,219
The other is a reduced
prostate cancer risk.

805
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,139
There's a study showing that
having sufficient selenium

806
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,202
can reduce prostate cancer risk.

807
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,150
And there is some evidence

808
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,260
that if you consume foods
from areas with soil

809
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,810
that's low in selenium,
that can be a problem.

810
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,320
And last episode, we talked
about all these issues related

811
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,033
to soil quality, things that
are making their way into food

812
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:36,043
that are disrupting hormones and so forth.

813
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:40,299
But having sufficient selenium from food

814
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,639
could offset the low content in any soil.

815
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,839
And so that apparently can
reduce prostate cancer risk.

816
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,770
It's a minor effect

817
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,100
but it's a statistically significant one.

818
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,469
And the other one is a reduction in acne,

819
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,619
which is interesting.

820
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,730
I'm guessing that that probably has to do

821
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,260
with the thyroid hormone pathway

822
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,110
because of the way thyroid
hormone can impact the liver.

823
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,910
And it turns out that the liver

824
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,910
and various biochemical reactions

825
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,420
in the liver can impact acne.

826
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,750
And that's probably an
episode all into itself

827
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,120
but those are just some
additional benefits

828
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,220
of getting a sufficient selenium.

829
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,070
Okay, so we're already deep into tools

830
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,970
related to making sure that
you have sufficient selenium,

831
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,430
iodine, and L-tyrosine
in order to make enough

832
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,660
thyroid hormones that can
support your metabolic processes

833
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,500
in your liver, your muscles, your tendons,

834
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,700
for whatever purpose,
keeping your metabolism high,

835
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,510
for body composition
reasons or for healing,

836
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,830
for keeping your brain working well.

837
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:42,580
Earlier I mentioned, there are people

838
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,720
who are following very clean diets.

839
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,410
So these are people that
consume no processed foods.

840
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,920
You know, any starch they might eat

841
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,550
is going to be maybe a rice or a grain

842
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,920
or any protein they might consume

843
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,910
is going to be either from, let's hope,

844
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,010
from humanely raised animal sources

845
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,480
or maybe they're pure plant-based.

846
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,140
Believe it or not, those folks

847
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,930
are actually very
susceptible to low iodine

848
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,770
because it turns out that
diets that are very meat rich

849
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,320
and don't have many vegetables,

850
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,150
as well as diets that
are very vegetable rich

851
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,040
but don't have many meats or salts

852
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,330
are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone

853
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,930
by way of the iodine
pathway and other pathways.

854
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,740
And so let me try and
simplify this for you.

855
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,810
Chances are if people are
doing the all-meat diet,

856
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,950
they're not sprinkling, they're
not wrapping those steaks

857
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,230
in seaweed and they may

858
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,270
or may not be supplementing with iodine.

859
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,040
Chances are they're probably
consuming iodine salt

860
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,440
but their requirements go up

861
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
if they're not consuming vegetables.

862
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,420
People who are consuming
vegetables is kind of interesting.

863
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,253
We always hear

864
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,520
that we should have our
cruciferous vegetables

865
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,740
and those are so important

866
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,090
but there are actually substances,

867
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,810
compounds within high quality
cruciferous vegetables

868
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,700
that can interfere with
thyroid hormone function.

869
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,010
So if you're eating a lot of that stuff,

870
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,670
a lot of cabbages and
just look up your other,

871
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,640
I think broccoli is a
cruciferous vegetable,

872
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,960
and I won't read off the whole list,

873
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,890
you could just put into the internet.

874
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,140
But we're always told to eat a lot

875
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,570
of the dark, leafy green stuff.

876
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,510
Well, unless that dark, leafy green stuff

877
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,590
is kelp or seaweed,

878
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,960
chances are that we're
not getting enough iodine

879
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,390
unless we're adding salt to our food.

880
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,860
And chances are that we may be lowering

881
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,950
the total amount of
thyroid that we're making,

882
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:37,950
as well as the fact that
in plant-rich diets,

883
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,710
it's hard to get enough L-tyrosine

884
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,300
and I don't want, you know,
I'm not here to inflame

885
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,070
any of the vegans or the carnivore folks.

886
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,380
I don't take a stance
either way on any of that.

887
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,970
I'm just learning, trying
to report the science.

888
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,740
The point I want to make is
your health is important.

889
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,730
So if you are purely plant-based

890
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,440
and you're eating a lot
of cruciferous vegetables,

891
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,240
make sure you're getting enough iodine.

892
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,410
It does seem like the
cruciferous vegetables

893
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,510
can increase the need for further iodine.

894
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,173
And same thing if you're
purely on this all-meat diet

895
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:10,000
or your keto, and you're not
ingesting many vegetables.

896
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,120
So I always thought that the
cleaner the diet, the better,

897
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,030
but it turns and probably that's true

898
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,130
from the standpoint of, you
know, hormone regulation,

899
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,720
you know, estrogen and
testosterone and other hormones.

900
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,510
The highly processed
foods really are terrible.

901
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,110
There's so much evidence for that.

902
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,760
The phthalates in plastics
and the processed foods

903
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,670
and the emulsifiers,

904
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,870
all this stuff we talked
about previous episode,

905
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,410
but it does seem to be that people

906
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,190
that are not getting enough
iodine for whatever reason,

907
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,320
really need to check out whether
or not their iodine levels

908
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,330
need to be increased because of the fact

909
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,324
that they're consuming so
many plants or so many meats

910
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:50,540
and in some cases,

911
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,750
plants that actually
lower thyroid hormone.

912
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,460
And not to beat a dead horse or cabbage,

913
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,490
but there are a number of
things that iodine can do

914
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,000
that are positive that are sort of,

915
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,190
they're related to thyroid, not directly,

916
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,400
they're kind of offshoots
of the thyroid pathway

917
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,990
on their downstream of it, we would say,

918
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,410
in terms of how they
impact metabolic function.

919
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,310
One of those is to reduce something

920
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,930
called c-reactive protein.

921
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,950
Some of you may have heard
of CRP or c-reactive protein.

922
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,990
C-reactive protein is
something that you want to keep

923
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,930
at modestly low levels.

924
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,220
It's associated with
inflammation and various forms

925
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,620
of heart disease and even eye
disease, macular degeneration.

926
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,100
So it does appear that
iodine supplementation

927
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,690
or getting sufficient iodine
from food, either works,

928
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,360
is associated with reduced
levels of c-reactive protein

929
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,610
in the blood and an
anti-inflammatory effect.

930
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,010
And the anti-inflammatory
effect brings us back

931
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,810
to our old friend, interleukin 6.

932
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,480
Remember, they're these
inflammatory cytokines.

933
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,180
They have many, many names

934
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,020
because there are many, many of them.

935
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,320
Interleukin 10 is the one
that's anti-inflammatory.

936
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,330
Interleukin 6 is the
one that's inflammatory.

937
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,450
Anytime you see IL-6,

938
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,170
that usually means that there's
an inflammatory response,

939
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,330
there's a wound, there's
inflammation of the brain,

940
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,170
somebody is either sleep
deprived or had a brain injury

941
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,190
or they're dealing with
some sort of infection.

942
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,130
IL-6 is kind of a
catch-all for inflammation.

943
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,070
And it does appear that
iodine supplementation

944
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:22,130
can reduce circulating IL-6
associated with inflammation.

945
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,590
So in that sense,

946
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,340
iodine can have an
anti-inflammatory effect.

947
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,680
So by now, it should be abundantly clear.

948
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,230
If you care about thyroid hormone,

949
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,960
if you care about the
pathways that it impacts

950
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,530
like having a high level of metabolism,

951
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,300
which I guess if for no
other reason is attractive

952
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,580
'cause then you can eat more

953
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,780
and still maintain a
healthy body composition,

954
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,230
but also for brain health,
cognitive function,

955
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,300
tissue repair, all that stuff,

956
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,160
keeping c-reactive protein
low, keeping IL-6 low,

957
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,480
make sure you're getting enough iodine,

958
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,240
selenium and L-tyrosine.

959
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,477
If you're curious how
thyroid actually increases

960
00:40:57,477 --> 00:40:59,920
the metabolism, allows you
to eat more, et cetera.

961
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,200
It relates to something
we covered last issue,

962
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,690
which is glucose.

963
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,860
Remember when you eat
something, blood sugar goes up,

964
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,340
insulin is secreted from the pancreas

965
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,470
and it makes sure that blood
glucose doesn't go too high,

966
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,470
which can damage tissues or too low,

967
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,133
which can make you hypoglycemic.

968
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,810
Thyroid increases glucose uptake

969
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,360
by various tissues, in
particular muscle and bone.

970
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,720
It actually can increase
bone mineral density,

971
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,830
which is a really good thing.

972
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,190
As you get older, injuries,

973
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,120
when I say older, I mean
basically 30 and older,

974
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,840
the reason you can recover
more quickly from injuries

975
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,330
if you have a healthy thyroid
and healthy thyroid pathways

976
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,740
is because you can consume energy.

977
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,800
That energy is diverted toward bone repair

978
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,960
and muscle repair and cartilage repair.

979
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,810
And so the way it does this
again is by increasing ATP.

980
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,030
But the whole idea here is that iodine,

981
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,420
selenium, L-tyrosine, allow
thyroid to be at healthy levels

982
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,760
so that thyroid then can
take glucose in the blood

983
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,330
and divert it to tissues
for it to be used,

984
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,580
in particular your brain.

985
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,410
And that's why these things
that we're talking about,

986
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,750
supplementing or getting from food,

987
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,940
can actually improve or
support brain function.

988
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,970
People are always asking me,

989
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,870
what is the food that I
should eat for my brain?

990
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,470
Like, are blueberries good for your brain?

991
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,860
Or they do ask me, are
walnuts good for your brain

992
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,230
'cause it looks like a brain?

993
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,580
We talked about that earlier.

994
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,240
The fact of the matter is what you need

995
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,580
are nutrients that support hormones

996
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,770
and biological pathways
that support the brain.

997
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,980
That's the way to think about it.

998
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,210
And I realized when people ask,

999
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,700
what should I eat to support my brain?

1000
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,760
That's basically what
they're asking in short form.

1001
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,020
So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy

1002
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,890
at healthy levels that is,
is going to be terrific

1003
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,820
for your brain because
75% of your metabolism

1004
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,700
is from your brain.

1005
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,520
The ability of your brain to use glucose

1006
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,060
or ketones for that matter
is going to be aided

1007
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,230
by having healthy thyroid.

1008
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,170
So do the things, take
the things, eat the things

1009
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,380
that are going to allow you

1010
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,010
to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone.

1011
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm sure a number of you
are out there wondering,

1012
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,320
do I have healthy levels
of thyroid hormone?

1013
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,890
Those can be measured from the blood.

1014
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,550
There are some telltale signs
of having really high thyroid

1015
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,590
or really low thyroid, and I
could start listing those off.

1016
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,580
They're easy to find online as well.

1017
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,630
Things like bulging eyes,

1018
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,100
inability to maintain
weight, shaky, anxiety,

1019
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,720
that's kind of hyperthyroidal,
thinning of hair,

1020
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,498
this kind of thing.

1021
00:43:23,498 --> 00:43:26,750
I don't want to get into
diagnosing hypothyroidism

1022
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,880
and hyperthyroidism.

1023
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,780
It's just impossible 'cause you're there

1024
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,590
and I'm here and we're kind
of shouting back and forth

1025
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,430
through a tunnel of video and comments.

1026
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,160
If you're concerned about
having excessively high

1027
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,640
or excessively low levels
of thyroid hormone,

1028
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,000
absolutely look up what the symptoms are.

1029
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,930
Talk to your physician.

1030
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,600
And there are a number of good treatments.

1031
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,400
I didn't talk about prescription drugs

1032
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,770
that can improve symptoms
related to hypo or hyperthyroid.

1033
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,240
Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.

1034
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,610
So if you don't make enough thyroid,

1035
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,200
you can take thyroid,
it's by prescription.

1036
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,220
If you have too much thyroid,

1037
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,670
sometimes they'll take
out the thyroid gland

1038
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,620
or they can administer drugs

1039
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,290
that will either block
receptors or will interfere

1040
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,420
with some of the pathways from the brain

1041
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,010
to the pituitary or from
the pituitary to the thyroid

1042
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,770
in order to adjust the
thyroid hormone that way.

1043
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:21,140
So there are the big guns
in terms of the treatments

1044
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
for different thyroid disorders

1045
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,050
but we're not talking
about thyroid disorders,

1046
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,370
we're talking about how to get
and maintain thyroid levels

1047
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,340
in healthy ranges and some
straightforward ways to do that

1048
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,770
through diet and supplementation.

1049
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,200
There's also a lot of evidence

1050
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,520
that for people who menstruate,

1051
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,010
levels of thyroid hormone
can fluctuate dramatically

1052
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,580
across the menstrual cycle.

1053
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,860
So that's really going to be
a process of experimentation.

1054
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,940
I don't know that you could,

1055
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,560
you could, in theory, take
blood at different phases

1056
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,220
of your cycle and figure
out whether or not

1057
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,300
your thyroid hormone was
excessively high or low

1058
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,700
at different phases of the cycle.

1059
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,570
That's going to be pretty tough to do.

1060
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,960
If you have an endocrinologist

1061
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,250
that's willing to do
that with you, terrific.

1062
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,730
I think most people are
going to have to figure out

1063
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,650
how supplementing the sorts of things

1064
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,650
that we talked about before,

1065
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,570
or getting them from foods relates

1066
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,380
to different aspects of their cycle.

1067
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,310
In general, the first half of
the cycle before ovulation,

1068
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,830
people crave carbohydrates and sweets more

1069
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:18,570
and that makes total
sense based on the biology

1070
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,400
of the menstrual cycle.

1071
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,800
Thyroid hormone is going to go up as you,

1072
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,850
as anyone, male or female,
menstruating or not,

1073
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,560
increases more starchy carbohydrates.

1074
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,840
This is interesting because
ketogenic diets have been shown

1075
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,680
to slightly lower thyroid levels.

1076
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,990
And that makes sense
because in ketogenic diets,

1077
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,250
blood glucose levels are very low.

1078
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,940
And thyroid hormone is
secreted in large part

1079
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,090
in proportion to how much
glucose is in the bloodstream

1080
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,800
and how much that glucose,
excuse me, needs to be regulated.

1081
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,050
So I'm not trying to
demonize the ketogenic diet.

1082
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,410
I think it definitely has its place.

1083
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,670
There are 22 studies now

1084
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,940
showing that it can dramatically
reduce blood glucose.

1085
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,320
And about a third of those show
that thyroid hormone levels

1086
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,430
are slightly reduced,
sometimes significantly,

1087
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,560
if not more, in the ketogenic diet

1088
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,120
that may explain, I want
to highlight may explain

1089
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,320
the fact that when people go
back to a more traditional diet

1090
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,700
if they've been on a ketogenic
diet for a long time,

1091
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,010
that oftentimes they will
gain weight very quickly

1092
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,630
as they bring carbohydrates
back into their diet.

1093
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,500
Some people are cycling

1094
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,220
between ketogenic and non-ketogenic
every three, four days.

1095
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,540
So-called cyclical ketogenic diet.

1096
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,830
Some people are staying ketogenic
for long periods of time.

1097
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,450
Some people six days on, one day off.

1098
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,730
So there's a huge variation there.

1099
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,400
The point is that carbohydrates,

1100
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,860
starchy carbohydrates in particular,

1101
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,500
support the healthy
production of T3 and T4.

1102
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,540
And so if you're very low carbohydrate,

1103
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,110
you're going to have a
reduction in T3 and T4.

1104
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,210
And so if you're going
to bring carbohydrates

1105
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,360
back into your diet,

1106
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,790
then you might want to
do it more gradually.

1107
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,430
And for those of you that menstruate,

1108
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,550
and are craving carbohydrates

1109
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,740
in the early part of the cycle,

1110
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,000
that is actually associated
with having a healthy cycle.

1111
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,960
If any of you have had a healthy
cycle on a ketogenic diet,

1112
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,850
that would be interesting.

1113
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,490
Maybe let me know through the comments

1114
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,430
or point me in the
direction of some research

1115
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,550
if you're aware of it.

1116
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,470
So as you can start to see,

1117
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,110
there's this really beautiful interplay

1118
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,230
between the different hormones,

1119
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,850
between insulin and glucose,
between estrogen and thyroid,

1120
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,090
between thyroid and blood
glucose and the ketogenic diet.

1121
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,800
It all starts to fit together

1122
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,590
in ways that make a lot of sense

1123
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,680
once you understand just
kind of the core elements

1124
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,760
of what the hormones are

1125
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,030
and the variety of
tissues that they work on.

1126
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,130
The simple version of this

1127
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,410
is if you haven't had a
carbohydrate for a year,

1128
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,880
then your T3, T4 levels
are going to be pretty low.

1129
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,710
And I'm sure there's some
ketonistas out there.

1130
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:47,650
They're going to say, wait, no,

1131
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,080
thyroid hormone levels go up with keto.

1132
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,670
That might be true for other reasons,

1133
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,650
indirect reasons related
to hormone pathways

1134
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,270
that are cascade from being in ketosis

1135
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,270
for long periods of time.

1136
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,103
Great.

1137
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:02,680
But for most people that don't
consume any carbohydrate,

1138
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,280
T3, T4 are going to go down.

1139
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,530
And when they start to consume foods

1140
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,950
that require thyroid metabolism

1141
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,720
in order to work with, to metabolize,

1142
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,860
then weight gain can
sometimes happen more quickly.

1143
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,550
So it's just something to consider.

1144
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:19,860
And it's something to work with carefully

1145
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,300
if you're going to be cyclic
ketogenic, long-term ketogenic.

1146
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,520
And if you're not ketogenic,

1147
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,060
and you're consuming carbohydrates.

1148
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,490
And the three things that
we talked about earlier,

1149
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,590
selenium, tyrosine and iodine,

1150
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,220
chances are unless there's
an underlying condition there

1151
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,860
that your levels of
thyroid are going to be

1152
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,210
in healthy range.

1153
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,150
Next, we're going to talk
about growth hormone.

1154
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,800
Growth hormone has
received a ton of attention

1155
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,910
in the last 20 years.

1156
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,350
I actually remember when
it was for sequenced.

1157
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,200
This was a huge deal.

1158
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,600
There was a huge patent drama.

1159
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,820
I won't mention the universities
of the people involved.

1160
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,350
There were companies and
monster patents and payouts

1161
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,740
and it was really interesting.

1162
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,240
You can look that up online

1163
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,680
if you're interested in some
of the scientific history.

1164
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,510
Growth hormone is a
pretty straightforward one

1165
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,350
for you to understand
now because it follows

1166
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:09,300
the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.

1167
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,110
In fact, their functions
are so closely overlapping

1168
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,840
on the, you know, when we
first look at the face of it

1169
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,990
that you're probably going to think,

1170
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,680
why do you have these two systems?

1171
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:23,680
So just very briefly, growth
hormone-releasing hormone.

1172
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,850
So remember releasing means
it comes from the brain,

1173
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:28,110
comes from the brain
and tells the pituitary

1174
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,630
to release growth hormone,

1175
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,040
and then growth hormone is released

1176
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,620
into the bloodstream
where it goes and acts

1177
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:36,000
on a ton of tissues, muscle, ligaments,

1178
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,950
bone, fat, et cetera,
to increase metabolism.

1179
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,460
It sounds just like thyroid hormone.

1180
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,840
And they do work in parallel.

1181
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,060
And that's why we've lumped them together

1182
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,893
in the same episode.

1183
00:49:46,893 --> 00:49:49,200
They increase metabolism and repair

1184
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,453
and growth of tissues.

1185
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,770
A conversation about growth
hormone would be incomplete

1186
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,670
if we didn't talk about
the kind of extremes.

1187
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,180
There are certain people who are born

1188
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,230
that don't make enough growth hormone,

1189
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,100
and they end up very short in stature.

1190
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,697
There are certain people who
make a ton of growth hormone

1191
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:07,890
and they end up very, very large.

1192
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,170
They tend to have very large appendages.

1193
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,200
They have something called acromegaly.

1194
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,740
It's kind of like a
ridging of the forehead.

1195
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,740
It's actually a bone ridge.

1196
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,060
They are giant.

1197
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,400
And it used to be called giantism.

1198
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,290
And most people of course
are in a range of height

1199
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,170
and appendage length.

1200
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,270
That doesn't imply

1201
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,940
that there's a growth
hormone disruption there.

1202
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,730
Growth hormone received a lot of attention

1203
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,820
after it was sequenced because
that meant the opportunity

1204
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,020
to inject growth hormone

1205
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,890
and replace growth hormone that was lost.

1206
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,890
And there was actually a lot of cases

1207
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,130
of people taking their
kids and trying to get them

1208
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,399
to be taller for whatever reason

1209
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:51,790
by injecting growth hormone.

1210
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,410
Today, we're going to
talk about the things

1211
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:56,100
that anyone can do to
increase growth hormone.

1212
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,830
And there are reasons why certain people

1213
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,663
would want to do that.

1214
00:50:58,663 --> 00:51:00,130
People who overproduce growth hormone

1215
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,400
certainly would not want to do that.

1216
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,390
People who underproduce it
would probably want to do that.

1217
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,710
People that make normal, quote, unquote,

1218
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,130
levels of growth hormone
might want to do that

1219
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,970
as they age because during
puberty and development,

1220
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,820
the pituitary is churning
out tons of growth hormone.

1221
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,810
It's responsible for the
growth, not surprising,

1222
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,570
of the body and all its features.

1223
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,200
Height, just being one of those.

1224
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,040
And so as we age, we
make less growth hormone.

1225
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,980
And that is one of the
reasons why we recover

1226
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,240
more slowly from injuries.

1227
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,600
It's one of the reasons
why we accumulate body fat.

1228
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,250
And it's one of the reasons
why our metabolism slows.

1229
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,770
And so growth hormone replacement therapy

1230
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,670
has been tremendously
popular in the last 20 years,

1231
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,520
which is not to say it doesn't
carry its problems, it does.

1232
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,240
Here's one of the major problems

1233
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,490
with injecting growth hormone.

1234
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,920
Not saying people shouldn't do this

1235
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,590
if the doctor has approved
it or it's in keeping

1236
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,000
with their particular life goals,

1237
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,433
but growth hormone, if it's
in levels that are too high,

1238
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,550
will cause growth of all tissues.

1239
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,830
So not just muscle, not just reduction

1240
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,570
in body fat by metabolizing, you know,

1241
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,750
by allowing fatty acids to
be pulled out of storage

1242
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,910
and used for ATP, but it
will also cause increase

1243
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,990
in growth of the heart and the lungs

1244
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,650
and the liver and the spleen.

1245
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:28,090
And so this is the concern
with abuse of growth hormone.

1246
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,030
So we're not going to be talking

1247
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,140
about abuse of growth hormone.

1248
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,720
We will, however, talk about
tools that anyone can use

1249
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,880
to increase levels of growth hormone.

1250
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,930
Some of them are behavioral,

1251
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,630
some of them are supplement-based

1252
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:42,280
and some of them interact with
behaviors and supplements.

1253
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,370
And what's cool about the discussion

1254
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,820
about growth hormone is that the tools

1255
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,980
that exist out there to
increase growth hormone

1256
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,940
are very actionable.

1257
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,720
Most people can do these without the need

1258
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,420
for any equipment or even any supplement.

1259
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,890
Although there are some
supplement related themes

1260
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,090
for tools for growth hormone increase.

1261
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,720
And also the increases that one can get

1262
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,230
in growth hormone are substantial.

1263
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:07,490
So normally, when you
talk about the difference

1264
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,370
between taking something
as an exogenous substance

1265
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,310
like testosterone or estrogen
versus using supplements

1266
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,880
or behaviors to increase them,

1267
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,130
you're talking about tenfold
differences from, you know,

1268
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,880
administering the prescription compound.

1269
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,920
In terms of growth hormone,

1270
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,530
there are things that can
increase growth hormone three,

1271
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,090
four, 500% or more.

1272
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,230
And even though that's
a short-lived increase,

1273
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,570
they can have very powerful effects

1274
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,860
on metabolism and on repair of tissues.

1275
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,480
So let's talk about those.

1276
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,540
Okay, let's go step by
step in terms of the things

1277
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,500
that anyone, perhaps everyone,

1278
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,670
should be doing in order to maintain

1279
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,020
healthy growth hormone levels

1280
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,200
or increased growth hormone levels.

1281
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,270
Unless you have overproduction
of growth hormone,

1282
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,313
chances are these things
are going to benefit to you.

1283
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,010
However, as always, I want to emphasize,

1284
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,750
talk to a doctor before you do anything,

1285
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,340
including remove any treatments.

1286
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,150
So anything you would add or take away,

1287
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,790
that's the responsibility of you

1288
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,550
and your healthcare provider, okay?

1289
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,850
I don't just say that to protect me,

1290
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,960
I say that to protect you.

1291
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,740
First of all, growth hormone is released

1292
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,570
every night when you go to sleep

1293
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,170
and it's released in
the early part of sleep,

1294
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,073
during so-called slow-wave sleep.

1295
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,800
So the two conditions that have to be met

1296
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,210
in order for growth hormone
to be secreted regularly

1297
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,620
for tissue repair, et cetera,

1298
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,610
are you need to get into slow-wave sleep

1299
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:39,410
that so-called deep sleep
and you need blood insulin

1300
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,800
and glucose to be relatively low.

1301
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,740
So eating within two hours of sleep,

1302
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,300
excuse me, eating within
two hours of going to sleep

1303
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,200
is going to suppress
growth hormone release.

1304
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,690
That's very clear.

1305
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,970
However, some people are
going to have problems

1306
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,470
falling asleep if they are too hungry.

1307
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,970
So you have to work with that

1308
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,520
and decide what you're going to eat.

1309
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,420
And when you're going to eat that thing

1310
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,640
so that you're not so hungry

1311
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,840
that you're having trouble falling asleep.

1312
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,660
The episodes on sleep that were covered

1313
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,760
in episodes two, three, and
four of the Huberman Lab Podcast

1314
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,160
has, I believe, more tools
there than you could ever want

1315
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,460
or make use of in terms
of how to optimize sleep.

1316
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,620
So you can refer to those, if you like.

1317
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,850
So don't eat too close to sleep

1318
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,430
and then get into slow-wave sleep.

1319
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:24,350
And as I talked about in one
of those earlier episodes,

1320
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,820
the first half of the night,

1321
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,380
slow-wave sleep and
deep sleep predominate.

1322
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,270
The second half of the night,

1323
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:31,910
it's another kind of sleep,
we call it REM sleep.

1324
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,050
So what is special about
this early phase of sleep?

1325
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,370
This is how you should be thinking

1326
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:39,200
if you listen to this podcast.

1327
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,400
You should be thinking, okay,

1328
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,960
I hear that something is important,

1329
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,560
it's related, it's in the pathway,

1330
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,680
but mechanistically when we
say get into slow-wave sleep,

1331
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,080
get into deep sleep,

1332
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,990
that's when growth hormone is secreted.

1333
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,750
The question you should
be asking yourselves

1334
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:56,750
as scientists of yourselves
is wait, why slow-wave sleep?

1335
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:01,470
What in particular about
slow-wave deep sleep

1336
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,400
allows the pituitary to
release growth hormone?

1337
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,410
Like, what is it?

1338
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,270
Because if you can understand that,

1339
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,490
if you can understand a
little bit of mechanism,

1340
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,800
there are actually ways
that you can increase

1341
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,810
the amount of growth
hormone that you release

1342
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,260
both in sleep and out of sleep.

1343
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,610
So the answer is it's delta
wave activity in the brain.

1344
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:26,320
Delta waves are these big
giant waves of activity

1345
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,930
in the brain that correlate
with slow-wave sleep

1346
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,560
as opposed to faster waves of activity

1347
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,450
that is associated with
rapid eye movement sleep.

1348
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:37,810
So slow-wave sleep and the delta activity

1349
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,810
actually triggers the
neurons in the brain,

1350
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,580
the releasing hormone, right?

1351
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,380
Growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons

1352
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,040
to signal to the pituitary.

1353
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,320
Now, how do I know this is true?

1354
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,230
And what can you do with this?

1355
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,130
Well, we know this is true

1356
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,937
because researchers have taken people

1357
00:56:50,937 --> 00:56:54,750
and sleep deprived them,
and they just asked, well,

1358
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,100
is it just one period
of time every 24 hours

1359
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,260
and then the pituitary
releases growth hormone?

1360
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,930
If that were the case, that would say

1361
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,680
that growth hormone is just released

1362
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,400
in a so-called circadian dependent way.

1363
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,460
Every 24 hours is the pulse of it, but no,

1364
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,680
it's always relating to slow-wave

1365
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,420
deep sleep and delta waves.

1366
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,410
And this is cool because what it means

1367
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,470
is that even if you're not
measuring your brainwaves

1368
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,490
during sleep, which most
of you probably are not,

1369
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,040
you might be measuring slow-wave sleep

1370
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,060
or deep sleep using a
device like a Whoop or Oura.

1371
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,230
And even if you're not,

1372
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,500
what this means is that during the day,

1373
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,440
there's the potential

1374
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,380
to also increase growth hormone release

1375
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,480
if you can get the brain into
the so-called delta waves.

1376
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,300
And it turns out there
are things you can do

1377
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,310
in waking as well to increase
growth hormone release.

1378
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:42,890
So we're going to talk about those next.

1379
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,330
But as a tool and to just really make sure

1380
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:47,200
that we put brackets around this,

1381
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,380
try and have blood glucose not too high.

1382
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,840
So if you do need to eat close to bed,

1383
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,020
you wouldn't want to eat anything

1384
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,610
that would increase
blood glucose too much.

1385
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:57,080
Try not to eat too close to bedtime.

1386
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,010
Get into deep sleep early in the night.

1387
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,990
Get the growth hormone release.

1388
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,970
And understand that it's
the delta waves of activity,

1389
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:06,190
the sweeping big waves of
activity in the neurons

1390
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,373
that stimulate the brain
to stimulate the pituitary.

1391
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:10,570
Because once you understand that,

1392
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,940
then you have something to anchor to

1393
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,480
in terms of thinking what
are the things I can do

1394
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,190
in waking that will allow me
to release more growth hormone

1395
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,970
which for most people is
going to be a good thing.

1396
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,600
Several times before on this podcast,

1397
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,940
I've talked about the fact
that I'm not a big fan

1398
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,240
of melatonin supplementation
for most purposes.

1399
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,393
It might be helpful under
conditions of jet lag.

1400
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,930
However, there are a lot of reasons

1401
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,270
why I personally don't like melatonin.

1402
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,030
It interacts with the
reproductive hormones,

1403
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,420
testosterone and estrogen,

1404
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,530
and that whole access in
ways that are unattractive,

1405
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,363
at least to me.

1406
00:58:46,363 --> 00:58:48,770
It suppresses puberty during development.

1407
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:53,110
It's present in much, much
higher doses in most supplements

1408
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:57,240
than one would normally make
like a hundred fold, 300 fold.

1409
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,250
However, today I'm going
to talk about an instance

1410
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,870
where very low levels of
melatonin supplementation

1411
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,170
might actually be advantageous.

1412
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,900
And that is aiding the transition

1413
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:12,080
to the delta wave, slow-wave
sleep I just described

1414
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,010
because that's the pattern of sleep

1415
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,940
and brainwave activity that
triggers growth hormone release.

1416
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,530
So whereas most melatonin
supplements are one milligram,

1417
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,920
three milligrams, 12
milligrams, this kind of thing,

1418
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,330
that is super physiological.

1419
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,330
There are some data
showing that microgram,

1420
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:35,330
maybe 500 micrograms of
melatonin, so half a milligram,

1421
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,970
can be beneficial in shifting the pattern

1422
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,550
of early night's sleep
toward more of the slow-wave

1423
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,650
deep sleep delta activity

1424
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,930
and improving growth hormone release.

1425
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,610
Not a lot of studies but the
ones that I saw are quality.

1426
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,210
They were done in subjects that, you know,

1427
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:55,660
both sexes, sufficient numbers, et cetera.

1428
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,580
So this is interesting.

1429
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,020
So if you're interested in
melatonin supplementation,

1430
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,250
you might think about it
just at very low levels.

1431
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,130
You know, hundreds of micrograms

1432
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,990
as opposed to the milligram dosages.

1433
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,430
Most of the ones out there

1434
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,300
are going to be in milligram dosages.

1435
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,660
So that's one way that
some studies have shown

1436
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,080
that you can increase the
amount of growth hormone

1437
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,970
that's secreted in early phases of sleep.

1438
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:23,020
Now, the delta wave activity
and the slow-wave activity

1439
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,830
in the brain being very important

1440
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,360
for growth hormone release
and growth hormone release

1441
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,830
being so important for metabolic functions

1442
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,410
and peeling away unwanted body fat

1443
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,840
and repairing tissues, et cetera,

1444
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,630
forces us to ask, well,
what other things can we do

1445
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,980
in waking in order to increase
growth hormone release?

1446
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:42,813
So let's start

1447
01:00:42,813 --> 01:00:46,540
with the ones that have
a potentially big effect

1448
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,400
but are a little bit harder to access.

1449
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,210
And for that, I want
to point toward a book,

1450
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,710
which is really kind of interesting.

1451
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,470
It's not focused on growth hormone

1452
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,000
but the book is called "Altered Traits."

1453
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,480
This is the book.

1454
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,287
It's an excellent book,

1455
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,087
"Altered Traits" by Goleman and Davidson.

1456
01:01:03,087 --> 01:01:04,860
"Science Reveals How Meditation

1457
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,410
Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body."

1458
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,120
Very interesting book.

1459
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,550
For those of you that are
interested in meditation,

1460
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,170
and perhaps those of you who are not,

1461
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,946
but are considering it,

1462
01:01:15,946 --> 01:01:18,250
what they talk about in
this book is the fact

1463
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,170
that meditation has two
separate lines of effects.

1464
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,870
One of those lines of effects are things

1465
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,260
that change your state.

1466
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,580
So you're stressed.

1467
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,910
You sit down, you meditate

1468
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,890
and you relax and you go
into a particular state.

1469
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,660
The other are the changes
that occur over time

1470
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,650
and those are changes in trait.

1471
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,720
So personality can actually change

1472
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,720
with long bouts of TM meditation
or repeated meditation.

1473
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,090
In any case, the reason we're talking

1474
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:49,090
about "Altered Traits" today
is because certain types

1475
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:52,760
of meditation can get people's brains

1476
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,590
into states that very closely
mimic slow-wave sleep.

1477
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,700
If you hear snoring in the
background, Costello is,

1478
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,470
sounds like he's in slow-wave sleep.

1479
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:04,320
These big oscillatory snores

1480
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,970
that he's in 23.6 hours per day.

1481
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:11,340
So what this means is for
people that are interested

1482
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,930
in increasing growth hormone,
a meditation practice

1483
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,930
that allows you to get into
these slow-wave delta type

1484
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,810
frequency activity in the
brain may be very beneficial

1485
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:25,900
because as I mentioned before,

1486
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,060
that's what's gating
growth hormone release.

1487
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,900
It's not just a circadian phenomenon,

1488
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,010
it's actually controlled
by these brainwaves.

1489
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,970
I did look up binaural beats.

1490
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,970
I get so many questions
about binaural beats

1491
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,730
and it's a really attractive idea, right?

1492
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,940
Binaural beats, for
those of you don't know,

1493
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,090
you listen to one frequency
of tone in one ear

1494
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,370
and another frequency of
tone and the other ear,

1495
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:50,110
and then the brain essentially
takes the average of the two

1496
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,870
or there's some other
wiring in the brainstem

1497
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,060
that makes it not quite the average

1498
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,600
but it takes the average of
the two for sake of discussion.

1499
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,310
And that frequency is
what the brain entrains

1500
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,930
or maps onto.

1501
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,840
There are a lot of apps that are claiming

1502
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,840
that you can get the
brain into delta waves

1503
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,910
using binaural beats.

1504
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,880
I could not find quality
peer review studies

1505
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,930
supporting that, but I know
there are a lot of fans

1506
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,260
out there of binaural beats.

1507
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,660
If you know of any literature

1508
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,500
that's independent of the company

1509
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,690
that makes the binaural beat technology,

1510
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:22,010
so unbiased research,
please send it my way.

1511
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:26,580
But in "Altered Traits,"
Goleman and Davidson

1512
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:29,360
talk about the fact that
people who do 20 minutes

1513
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,970
of sitting meditation per day

1514
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:36,970
can access these slow-wave
sleep like brain states.

1515
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:38,320
Now, I've talked a lot on here

1516
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,410
about non-sleep deep rest,

1517
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,650
things like yoga nidra and hypnosis.

1518
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,600
I'm not aware that those will put people

1519
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,890
into slow-wave sleep per
se, or delta waves per se.

1520
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,420
So we're really talking about 20 minutes

1521
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,300
of more traditional type meditation.

1522
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:55,750
Okay, so we've talked about
very low doses of melatonin

1523
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,250
as a way to trigger delta waves

1524
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,640
and more growth hormone release in sleep.

1525
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,860
There's science to support that.

1526
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:05,140
We've now talked about a
waking behavior of 20 minutes

1527
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:08,050
of sort of what I would
call standard meditation

1528
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:10,030
or just sitting there,
concentrating on one's breathing

1529
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,340
to try and access delta waves.

1530
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,860
Binaural beats, no science yet.

1531
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,693
Who knows?

1532
01:04:15,693 --> 01:04:17,310
Maybe there's science to support it.

1533
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,940
If you're aware of it, let me know.

1534
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,620
Now, let's move to the
things that one can do

1535
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:25,130
that have been shown to have
what's, let's just be honest,

1536
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,080
pretty enormous effects on
growth hormone release in waking.

1537
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,930
And these are things
that are very actionable.

1538
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:34,290
One of the things that
can have a dramatic effect

1539
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,110
on levels of growth
hormone release in waking

1540
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,050
as well as in sleep the
following night is exercise.

1541
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:46,630
But the key is the type of
exercise and the duration.

1542
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,910
Now, there's a logic to this.

1543
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:51,340
There are hundreds, if
not thousands of studies

1544
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,210
measuring growth hormone,

1545
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:57,480
both during or sometimes after exercise

1546
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,780
or the following night.

1547
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,500
And the conclusion that one takes away

1548
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,140
from all of these is that exercise

1549
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,640
has to be of particular
duration and intensity

1550
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,810
in order to get growth hormone release.

1551
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,560
So first I'm just going to tell you

1552
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,570
what I found to be the maximum amount

1553
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,930
of growth hormone release

1554
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,910
as it relates to a
particular form of exercise.

1555
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:22,280
The particular form of exercise
is either weight training

1556
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,850
or it can be endurance training,

1557
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,170
but the endurance training
and the weight training

1558
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,460
actually have to be limited
to about 60 minutes,

1559
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,340
not much longer.

1560
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,350
Now, this is important

1561
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,350
because it's been shown
over and over again

1562
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,590
that if one exercises
too long with weights

1563
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:44,620
or endurance exercise, that
cortisol levels go high enough

1564
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,540
that it starts to inhibit the testosterone

1565
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,700
and even the estrogen pathways.

1566
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,460
This is why I believe
people who overexercise

1567
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,800
or exercise a lot can lose
their menstrual cycles.

1568
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,180
They stop menstruating.

1569
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,090
It's why you get
suppressions in testosterone

1570
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:01,400
if people train too long and too hard.

1571
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,970
The cutoff has always been, you know,

1572
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:06,370
60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.

1573
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,830
It's going to vary a lot
from person to person,

1574
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,770
but in terms of growth hormone,

1575
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,570
the conditions that seem to lead

1576
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:17,570
to the greatest growth hormone
releases are one, get warm.

1577
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,410
This is interesting, we're
going to talk about temperature.

1578
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:23,030
So a proper warmup seems to accelerate

1579
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,880
the release of growth hormone

1580
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,280
once the hard work phase starts.

1581
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,570
So 10 minutes of warmup
or so was the number

1582
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:33,000
that I extracted from all these studies.

1583
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,920
There's a beautiful review
on this, by the way.

1584
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,983
Growth hormone responses
of varying, excuse me,

1585
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:43,310
"Growth hormone, arginine and exercise."

1586
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,960
We'll talk about arginine
in a few minutes.

1587
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,930
That's by Kanaley, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y.

1588
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,940
It was published in Current Opinion

1589
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,520
in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care.

1590
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,700
The Current Opinion journals are generally

1591
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,150
of pretty high quality
in terms of the reviews

1592
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,830
just because they tend
to be pretty recent.

1593
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:06,170
And then the references
therein are also quite good.

1594
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,560
So what does this mean?

1595
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,910
This means warm up.

1596
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:09,900
And when you say warm up,

1597
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,600
it doesn't mean just warm
up the limbs and tissues

1598
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,130
that you're going to use
so you don't get injured,

1599
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,990
actually warm the body.

1600
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,580
So there was actually some discussion

1601
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,420
about whether or not
in cold winter months,

1602
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,900
people should wear like a stocking cap,

1603
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,240
bringing the conditions,
making the room warm.

1604
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,410
So getting the body warm as a
warmup seems to be important

1605
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,400
because temperature of the body

1606
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,640
seems to be an important condition

1607
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,630
or prerequisite for certain
patterns of exercise

1608
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,760
to maximize growth hormone release.

1609
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,000
So it's really interesting to me.

1610
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,970
I have an obsession with
how body temperature,

1611
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,110
light exercise and food interact.

1612
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,650
We're going right there with
the fact that if you get warm,

1613
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,190
you bring up the body temperature

1614
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:53,810
a degree or two or maybe
three, and then start exercise.

1615
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:57,640
It does appear that
high-intensity exercise,

1616
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,190
but again as discussed
in a previous episode,

1617
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,260
not exercise that brings
muscles to failure

1618
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,270
but close to it.

1619
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,120
So if it's weight-bearing exercise,

1620
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,150
it would be getting close
to that final repetitions

1621
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,190
where you can't complete them

1622
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,710
but not pushing through those
or even going to failure

1623
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:17,520
but getting close leads to anywhere

1624
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,990
from 300 to 500% increases in
resting growth hormone levels

1625
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:26,090
and 300 to 500% increases
in growth hormone

1626
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:28,340
the following night when you go to sleep,

1627
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,260
which is incredible.

1628
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,960
Now, I want to dissect this properly.

1629
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,910
Okay, so one of the other conditions

1630
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,520
that seem to be important, again,

1631
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,490
was to have relatively low blood glucose.

1632
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,529
So it's looking a lot like
the conditions you need

1633
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:44,249
for sleep in order to get maximum

1634
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,000
growth hormone release in sleep.

1635
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,143
So not having blood glucose
too high or too low,

1636
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,609
that's a discussion unto itself.

1637
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:54,249
You want to have sufficient
energy to do the exercise

1638
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,290
but getting warm,

1639
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,229
not having blood glucose
too high or too low.

1640
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:59,789
So probably not eating
too close to exercise

1641
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:04,300
or not in ingesting a lot of
sugars during the exercise.

1642
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,310
That was supported by
the fact that ingestion

1643
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,350
of a sports drink that
contains caloric sugar

1644
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,260
immediately flat-line the
growth hormone levels.

1645
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,189
So really interesting relationship

1646
01:09:14,189 --> 01:09:17,069
between insulin, glucose
and growth hormone.

1647
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,189
So then doing the training for anywhere

1648
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:23,079
from 60 to 75 minutes to
maximize growth hormone release.

1649
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,930
And then the other interesting thing

1650
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:28,590
was that even after the exercise,

1651
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:30,630
taking body temperature back down

1652
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:35,140
to normal levels relatively
quickly seemed to be associated

1653
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,160
with these big spikes in growth hormone.

1654
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,090
Otherwise, what would happen
is you get these big spikes

1655
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,000
in growth hormone, but if
the exercise went too long

1656
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,790
or if body temperature
remained too high for too long,

1657
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,760
then you didn't get the second increase

1658
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,930
in growth hormone the
following night, okay?

1659
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,729
So I hope I made that abundantly clear.

1660
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:53,159
Warm up well, get body temperature up,

1661
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,600
exercise 60 to 75 minutes.

1662
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,110
Don't go to absolute failure

1663
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:00,860
if your interest is in
growth hormone release

1664
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:04,210
both during the exercise
and later that night.

1665
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:07,320
And if you can bring body
temperature back down

1666
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,820
to normal levels by cooling off,

1667
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:11,080
maybe cool shower or maybe
ice pack or something,

1668
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,010
or maybe just turning
off the heat in the room

1669
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,840
or going outside, whatever it is,

1670
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,420
then you increase the probability

1671
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,720
that you're going to
increase growth hormone

1672
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,600
the following night as well.

1673
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,210
And again, these are big
increases, 300 to 500%.

1674
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,050
It's almost like you're getting

1675
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,390
a second sleep during the day.

1676
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,670
But if the exercise is too
hard, if body temperature

1677
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:33,180
stays too high for too long,
you disrupt the whole process

1678
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,850
and you don't get the effect
of increased growth hormone.

1679
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,420
Growth hormone is really powerful

1680
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,100
but it doesn't work alone.

1681
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,130
In fact, a lot of the effects
of growth hormone are mediated

1682
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:43,700
by its effects on the liver.

1683
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,610
So growth hormone is
released, goes to the liver,

1684
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,980
and then the liver releases
something called IGF-1,

1685
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,450
insulin growth factor 1.

1686
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,430
Insulin growth factor 1 was popular

1687
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,720
in the neuroscience
community as an area of focus

1688
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,290
because of its ability
to trigger improvements

1689
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,410
in memory and learning after exercise.

1690
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:03,080
And indeed exercise triggers

1691
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,774
both the release of
growth hormone and IGF-1.

1692
01:11:05,774 --> 01:11:08,710
IGF-1 seems responsible
for a lot of the effects

1693
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,600
of improved memory.

1694
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,050
Some people report that that is due

1695
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,690
to increased number of
neurons or neurogenesis,

1696
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:16,570
birth of new neurons.

1697
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,210
It's pretty clear that in humans,

1698
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,870
that's not what's happening.

1699
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,260
Yes in animals, not in humans.

1700
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,480
IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects

1701
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,290
on memory and cognition.

1702
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,147
And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release

1703
01:11:27,147 --> 01:11:30,520
and growth hormone release
is through exercise.

1704
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,510
Now, the interesting thing,

1705
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:35,050
and the reason I'm bringing up IGF-1 here

1706
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:37,500
is that certain patterns of exercise,

1707
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,500
actually duration of exercise
have different effects

1708
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,463
on IGF-1 and growth hormone,

1709
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:45,810
depending on whether or not the exercise

1710
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,590
is done by men or women.

1711
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,550
There's what we call sex-dependent effect.

1712
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,820
And the sex-dependent
effect is as follows.

1713
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,000
In this particular study
and several others,

1714
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,480
what they did is they had people exercise.

1715
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,760
They measured growth
hormone and IGF-1 levels

1716
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,690
from the blood before,
during and after exercise.

1717
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:08,390
And they could see when the
greatest increases occurred.

1718
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,750
This was standard sorts
of resistance exercise.

1719
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,843
So some squats.

1720
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:17,350
There was a sprint like activity.

1721
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:21,830
It doesn't really matter what
the specific exercises were.

1722
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,930
None of them were to failure.

1723
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,980
These were in kind of the 10 repetition

1724
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,230
or less range, six sets.

1725
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:28,840
So kind of standard weight training stuff

1726
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,630
that anyone might do.

1727
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:35,250
But what was interesting is
that women were able to access

1728
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,070
the biggest peak in
growth hormone and IGF-1

1729
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,410
early in the exercise.

1730
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:40,970
So in the first 30 minutes.

1731
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:45,190
So what this means is even
if you just have 30 minutes,

1732
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:48,920
at least for women, there's
going to be a big increase

1733
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,050
in growth hormone and IGF-1
in the first 30 minutes.

1734
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,950
For men, the biggest
increase occurred later

1735
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:58,950
in the exercise, which was
at 60 minutes or so total.

1736
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:02,620
And so the sex-dependent
effects are interesting.

1737
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,510
They point to the fact

1738
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,810
that things like cortisol,
testosterone, and estrogen,

1739
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,270
which of course vary in different levels

1740
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,240
in men and women are going to impact

1741
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,570
the release of things like
IGF-1 and growth hormone.

1742
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:16,290
And yes, they did control
for all sorts of things

1743
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,930
like diet and they controlled for weight

1744
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:20,030
and prior experience.

1745
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,890
It's actually a quite nice study.

1746
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:25,317
If you'd like to check it
out, it's by a Pierce et al,

1747
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,940
"Growth Hormone and
Insulin Growth Factor-I

1748
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,350
Molecular Weight Isoform Response

1749
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:32,230
to Resistance Exercise Are Sex-Dependent"

1750
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:35,820
in Frontiers in Endocrinology,
fine journal in 2020.

1751
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,130
So it's quite recent.

1752
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:38,470
So what does this mean?

1753
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,220
This means if you're exercising

1754
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,840
and you want growth
hormone release, warm up,

1755
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,390
do the type of exercise
that we've been discussing.

1756
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,010
Women, in the first 30 minutes,

1757
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,690
is when you're going to
get the maximum benefit

1758
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,630
in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.

1759
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:55,910
Men, you have to keep going
for the entire 60 minutes.

1760
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,270
So don't tap out early
if you're interested

1761
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,880
in getting the growth
hormone and IGF-1 release.

1762
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,520
And the same conditions apply

1763
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,710
about then cooling down and not making

1764
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,030
the exercise last so
long that you don't get

1765
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,840
the increase in growth
hormone the following night.

1766
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,310
My experience thus far
in doing this podcast

1767
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:16,160
is that people fall into
one of two categories.

1768
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,950
There are the just tell
me what to take people,

1769
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,010
the people that are really
eager to try supplements

1770
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:24,250
and maybe in prescription compounds.

1771
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,030
And then there are people
who are a little bit more shy

1772
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,490
about supplementation.

1773
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,080
They are more focused on what they can do

1774
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,940
with diet and behaviors
and things of that sort.

1775
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,150
I don't have a bias either way.

1776
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,580
I try and offer tools that are supported

1777
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,290
by the scientific literature.

1778
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,350
And I always point to safety margins.

1779
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,410
There are supplements that
can increase growth hormone

1780
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,330
to a considerable degree and no,

1781
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,130
these aren't growth hormone itself.

1782
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:51,110
Although, that of course
will increase growth hormone

1783
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,100
to a considerable degree.

1784
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,200
We will talk about
prescription drugs at the end,

1785
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,480
not just growth hormone,

1786
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:58,470
but some other things
that are quite prominently

1787
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,550
in use right now,

1788
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:03,580
in particular in the
entertainment industry.

1789
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,320
There are pretty interesting compounds.

1790
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,950
But first let's talk about supplements.

1791
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,550
So this has been known about for some time

1792
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:14,320
but arginine, the amino acid arginine,

1793
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,060
as well as the amino acid ornithine

1794
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:20,590
can increase growth hormone
levels substantially.

1795
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:24,660
Now, arginine has a number of effects.

1796
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,230
You can get it from food, you
can get it from supplements.

1797
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:30,830
Some people take it in
pill form or capsule form.

1798
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:34,943
Some people will actually
take it by IV, intravenously.

1799
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:39,650
The levels and the amounts
of arginine required

1800
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:42,610
to get big growth
hormone release increases

1801
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,730
is pretty substantial.

1802
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:46,900
So some people will take
arginine before bedtime,

1803
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,770
some people will take it before exercise.

1804
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:53,430
The prerequisite again
is low blood glucose.

1805
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:56,880
Blood glucose is high, it's
going to quash the effect.

1806
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,770
The amounts of arginine that people take

1807
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:04,300
are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams,

1808
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,670
or sometimes even more.

1809
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:09,223
Although, this is definitely
a case of more is not better.

1810
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:12,840
There's a threshold at
which growth hormone release

1811
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,880
is actually blunted by taking

1812
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,880
more than nine grams of arginine.

1813
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,740
Now, nine grams of arginine
orally is a lot of pills.

1814
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,070
It's at minimum nine pills.

1815
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:26,670
And it can cause some
GI disturbance, right?

1816
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,810
People can feel nauseous.

1817
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,110
Some people will throw it up.

1818
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:34,110
Some people get some constipation
or diarrhea, et cetera,

1819
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,570
or just stomachaches.

1820
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:38,500
I'm certainly not
suggesting people do this

1821
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,510
that they take arginine

1822
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:43,270
but that's the reason why most
of the studies that looked

1823
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:46,180
at the role of arginine
on growth hormone levels

1824
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:50,250
did it by IV, intravenous infusion.

1825
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,640
So what's interesting, however,

1826
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,020
is that whether or not
it's by mouth or by vein,

1827
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,230
taking arginine can dramatically increase

1828
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:03,390
growth hormone release and the levels

1829
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:07,460
or the amount of increase was anywhere

1830
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:12,355
from 100 on the low-end but
anywhere basically from 400

1831
01:17:12,355 --> 01:17:14,120
to 600% above baseline.

1832
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,770
So these are huge increases
in growth hormone.

1833
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,320
Now, I've never tried arginine.

1834
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,900
Arginine is out there for a
number of different purposes.

1835
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,980
One of them is to increase growth hormone.

1836
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,970
Some of the supplements out there

1837
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:30,320
to increase growth hormone
include arginine and ornithine.

1838
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:35,240
Arginine does have the
effect of dilating arterials.

1839
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,851
And it basically increases blood supply.

1840
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:42,170
The arginine pathway is
involved in vasodilation.

1841
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:43,250
It's actually the pathway

1842
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,570
that's downstream of a lot of drugs

1843
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:49,090
that are used to treat things
like erectile dysfunction.

1844
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:51,900
And anytime people have problems

1845
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,070
with peripheral blood flow of any kind,

1846
01:17:55,070 --> 01:18:00,070
they focus on compounds that
will either disrupt the enzymes

1847
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,020
or will adjust the levels of amino acids

1848
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,370
to get more vasodilation.

1849
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,550
So taking arginine for the purpose

1850
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,320
of increasing growth hormone
will also have the effect

1851
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,020
of dilating blood vessels

1852
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,610
and for people with blood, excuse me,

1853
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:17,280
with heart conditions, that
actually can be a serious issue.

1854
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,350
Now, here is something really important

1855
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,810
and interesting to note,

1856
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:24,930
which is that increasing arginine levels

1857
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:28,440
with the specific goal of
increasing growth hormone release

1858
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,460
can actually short circuit
the effects of exercise

1859
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,360
on growth hormone.

1860
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,950
Several studies that I looked at,

1861
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:39,800
looked at the interaction
of taking arginine

1862
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,390
and the exercise or just the arginine

1863
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,810
or just the exercise alone.

1864
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,080
And so you don't, unfortunately,

1865
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,700
if growth hormone increase is your goal,

1866
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:52,190
you don't unfortunately get to
increase growth hormone 800%

1867
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:53,880
by taking arginine and exercising.

1868
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,230
It always seems to be clamped

1869
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,630
at about 300 to 500% increases.

1870
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:59,220
Still large increases.

1871
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,960
So I make that point for several reasons.

1872
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,520
First of all, be aware that arginine

1873
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,640
has these other effects on vasodilation.

1874
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,230
Take those seriously if
you have a heart condition

1875
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:10,660
or take them seriously in any case.

1876
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:13,540
Second of all, you can
supplement with arginine,

1877
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,270
not exercise and get these big increases

1878
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:19,160
in growth hormone by
taking them before sleep.

1879
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,340
But if you're taking the
arginine before exercise,

1880
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,380
you're going to short circuit

1881
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:29,070
or clamp the effects of exercise
on growth hormone, okay?

1882
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,770
So it's something that one could use

1883
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:35,460
but it doesn't have a
synergistic effect with exercise.

1884
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,210
The two more or less cancel
each other out, not to zero,

1885
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:41,130
but you end up with the
same effect you would

1886
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:42,890
had you done one or the other.

1887
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,310
So hopefully that's clear.

1888
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:46,280
The other thing is if one's goal

1889
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,630
is really to increase
arginine in the blood

1890
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:49,510
for whatever reason,

1891
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:53,170
arginine may not actually
be the best way to do that.

1892
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:56,210
Because of the way it's
metabolized in the gut,

1893
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:59,430
it doesn't have access or get access

1894
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,660
to the tissues that
you're most interested in

1895
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,250
in terms of increasing growth hormone

1896
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,900
or vasodilation for that matter.

1897
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,080
And in that case,

1898
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,280
there's something else called L-citrulline

1899
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,900
which has powerful
effects on vasodilation,

1900
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:16,900
powerful effects potentially
on growth hormone levels

1901
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,210
via the arginine pathway.

1902
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:21,610
But basically L-citrulline,

1903
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,590
it acts as sort of a donor,

1904
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:26,560
or it's kind of a biological
prerequisite for arginine

1905
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,810
and can lead to even
bigger arginine increases

1906
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:32,190
than you would get if
you took arginine itself.

1907
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:34,700
And so L-citrulline is out there.

1908
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,030
Keep in mind that anything that dilates

1909
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:39,130
the blood vessels will
lower blood pressure.

1910
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:42,050
So L-citrulline, yes, will
lead to increase blood flow

1911
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,660
for whatever purpose
you want to use it for,

1912
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:47,210
whether or not that's pumps
in the gym or whatever.

1913
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,480
It also can lead to big increases

1914
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,120
in arginine and growth hormone,

1915
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,240
but it will lower blood pressure.

1916
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,180
So be aware of that.

1917
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,740
And understand that the biology
isn't so straightforward.

1918
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,430
L-citrulline may actually
be the better way

1919
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:03,960
to get arginine increases
than arginine itself.

1920
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,830
And ornithine can also
increase growth hormone,

1921
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,180
although that's also
through an indirect pathway.

1922
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,140
And nowadays, there isn't a lot of focus

1923
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:15,450
on ornithine as a way to
increase growth hormone.

1924
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,760
That was kind of all the rage in the 90s,

1925
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,760
not so much anymore.

1926
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,930
Nowadays, the people are really
in the know for this stuff

1927
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:23,420
tend to focus on L-citrulline.

1928
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:26,590
And if you're interested in
L-citrulline or arginine,

1929
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:30,370
I highly recommend you
go to our old friend,

1930
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:32,590
good friends, examine.com,

1931
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:35,940
because there you can
put it into their list.

1932
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,040
You can just put search
and it's totally free.

1933
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,430
And it will tell you that blood pressure

1934
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,520
will be slightly decreased.

1935
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,500
Power output in the gym will increase.

1936
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,390
There's very strong
effects on blood glucose.

1937
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:48,840
Fatigue is reduced notably.

1938
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,240
Big increases in nitric oxide.

1939
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,060
That's also related to the
increase in vasodilation.

1940
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:58,210
Plasma arginine, very high, excuse me,

1941
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:02,020
notable effects, very
high support for studies,

1942
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,900
which allow people more training
volume, aerobic exercise,

1943
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,450
arterial stiffness is brought down.

1944
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:07,920
There's a huge list of things.

1945
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,700
Increase in growth hormone.

1946
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:13,550
So two studies showing,
this was done double-blind.

1947
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,020
Great, you always want
to see double-blind,

1948
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,130
placebo controlled.

1949
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,990
This was only done in
males, not in females.

1950
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,800
Unfortunately, just have data from males

1951
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
but increases in growth hormone,

1952
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,430
it's a small, but a
real significant effect.

1953
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,330
And again, from quality studies.

1954
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:31,430
So there's a huge number of effects there.

1955
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,710
And some of the other kind
of more interesting ones

1956
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:38,620
about L-citrulline that you
might not have thought about

1957
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,000
are things like muscle oxygenation

1958
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,310
as we scroll down, decreases
in c-reactive protein.

1959
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,740
So a lot of the same things
that you might affect,

1960
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,080
expect, excuse me, from
the same sorts of compounds

1961
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,060
we saw before.

1962
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:56,190
The takeaway here is if you
want to increase growth hormone,

1963
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,830
think about the arginine pathway,

1964
01:22:57,830 --> 01:23:01,110
but arginine itself might
not be the best direct route

1965
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,943
to get there.

1966
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,910
L-citrulline might be a better option.

1967
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:07,130
But please do consider take very seriously

1968
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,630
the effects on blood pressure.

1969
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,910
So we've been talking about big effects

1970
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:15,420
from supplementation or
exercise on growth hormone,

1971
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,760
this extremely powerful hormone.

1972
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,360
And one thing to note is that
the profile of growth hormone

1973
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,540
as we age, changes, I
mentioned that earlier,

1974
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:28,570
but it's important to
understand how it changes.

1975
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,250
One thing that's particularly
interesting to me

1976
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,010
as somebody who's in his 40s

1977
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:36,670
is that it's actually
between ages 30 and 40

1978
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,050
that the amount of growth hormone

1979
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:40,980
that you release each night is reduced

1980
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,010
by two to threefold.

1981
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:44,380
That's really incredible.

1982
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,070
You know, we hear so much
about testosterone levels

1983
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:50,010
going down as we age or
estrogen levels going down.

1984
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:50,843
But if you recall

1985
01:23:50,843 --> 01:23:53,140
from the testosterone
and estrogen episode,

1986
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:55,290
we talked about the fact
that if you really look

1987
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:58,130
at the data, just for
instance, on testosterone,

1988
01:23:58,130 --> 01:24:02,190
there are men in their
90s and they are not rare,

1989
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,520
it turns out, that are
making as much testosterone

1990
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,300
and DHT, dihydrotestosterone,

1991
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,820
as they were in their 20s, okay?

1992
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,850
So we hear so much nowadays
about how testosterone levels

1993
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:15,570
are dropping, sperm levels
are dropping, et cetera.

1994
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,460
And I don't dispute that.

1995
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:19,580
I talked about that in that episode.

1996
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,620
But it's clear that testosterone
levels vary tremendously

1997
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:24,000
from person to person.

1998
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,550
And just getting older
does not necessarily mean

1999
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,800
that testosterone levels are dropping.

2000
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,430
Growth hormone levels, it seems,

2001
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:33,950
are dropping when people
are in their 30s and 40s

2002
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:35,390
and they're dropping substantially.

2003
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:37,610
And that seems to be the
case across the board.

2004
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:40,490
You're just not going to find
people in their 40s, 50s and 60s

2005
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:42,580
that are making as much growth hormone

2006
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,800
as they were in their teens and 20s.

2007
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,330
And as somebody who, I feel really good,

2008
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,700
but as somebody who definitely noticed

2009
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:51,960
that as I got into my 40s

2010
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,200
that even if I slept the same amount,

2011
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,730
I wasn't feeling quite

2012
01:24:55,730 --> 01:25:00,690
as I would say able to
recover from exercise

2013
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:03,540
or wound healing even with
the same amount of sleep.

2014
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,920
And I was trying to optimize
a great number of things.

2015
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,660
This business of growth hormone

2016
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,430
became a particular interest to me.

2017
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:11,810
And since the ways to
manipulate growth hormone

2018
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:14,060
in men and women are so straightforward.

2019
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,310
And since everybody goes

2020
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,540
through this age-related
decline very dramatically,

2021
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,010
it seems to me that the things

2022
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:22,880
that we're supposed to be
doing anyway, like exercising,

2023
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,660
like trying not to eat
too close to bedtime,

2024
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,730
trying to optimize sleep.

2025
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:27,130
All of these are wonderful tools

2026
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:31,590
that we should be pursuing
and perhaps using.

2027
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,260
And they can actually offset

2028
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:36,370
the two to three fold decrease, right?

2029
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,150
If we're talking about a
two to threefold decrease

2030
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:40,270
for people that are in their 30s and 40s.

2031
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,940
And then we're talking about increases

2032
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,200
from exercise or maybe
from supplementation

2033
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:49,030
but certainly from
exercise of 300 to 500%.

2034
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:50,990
Well, then, all of a
sudden we're in a position

2035
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:53,210
to actually offset the age-related decline

2036
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:55,820
in growth hormone completely
just through behaviors.

2037
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,160
And I think that's quite
interesting and quite powerful.

2038
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,050
Now, I'd like to discuss a way that anyone

2039
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:04,170
can increase their levels of
growth hormone dramatically.

2040
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:06,560
And when I say dramatically,
I mean dramatically.

2041
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,430
I'll get to the numbers
in a couple minutes.

2042
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:13,140
But we have to remember how
growth hormone is released

2043
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,510
in the first place.

2044
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:18,040
Remember, it all starts in the
brain, in the hypothalamus.

2045
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,590
The hypothalamus is a
brain area that controls

2046
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:24,440
things like sexual behavior,
temperature regulation,

2047
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,840
circadian behavior, meaning
when you want to be awake

2048
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,500
and when you want to be asleep,
aggression, all of that.

2049
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,170
There are other brain areas involved too

2050
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:35,210
but it has a rich collection
of different neurons

2051
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:38,920
involved in all these
very basic functions.

2052
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,600
Now, as we talked about
the releasing hormones,

2053
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,700
the growth hormone-releasing hormone,

2054
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,330
it comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.

2055
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:49,750
Those then communicate with the pituitary

2056
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,980
and the pituitary releases growth hormone

2057
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:53,870
and then the growth hormone

2058
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,710
acts on all these
different tissues, muscle,

2059
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,433
liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.

2060
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,787
Makes them use energy.

2061
01:27:00,787 --> 01:27:02,300
That's why you lose body fat

2062
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,470
when growth hormone levels are high.

2063
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:07,493
It makes you grow muscle,
strengthens bones, et cetera.

2064
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,690
Now, one of the things
that has a profound effect

2065
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:17,310
on growth hormone levels,
growth hormone release,

2066
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,810
is temperature.

2067
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:21,090
Now, the data on this are very strong

2068
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:23,280
and the data come from both animal studies

2069
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,140
and human studies.

2070
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,360
So there are a number of studies

2071
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,050
that have explored how
making animals cold or hot

2072
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:31,720
can increase growth hormone.

2073
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:35,270
And if you're guessing which
direction this is going to go,

2074
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:38,200
you can probably imagine
that making animals

2075
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:41,140
or people warmer is the way to go

2076
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,250
if you want to increase growth hormone.

2077
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,980
Now, anytime you're going
to increase temperature

2078
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,700
of yourself or anyone else
or an animal, it is risky.

2079
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,230
I want to be really clear about this.

2080
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:53,440
Not everyone should engage

2081
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,653
in the behaviors I'm about to describe.

2082
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,130
And I should just say
the reason it's risky

2083
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:01,080
is it doesn't take much
of a temperature increase

2084
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,820
in the brain to cook the
brain, to cook neurons.

2085
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,660
And after that point,
neurons can't come back.

2086
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:09,580
And people can die from hyperthermia.

2087
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,470
We have a much greater
range in terms of cold.

2088
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:13,030
You can also die of hypothermia.

2089
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:14,980
You can freeze to death.

2090
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:18,230
But you have a much greater
range of getting cold

2091
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:20,450
than you do warming up the brain.

2092
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:24,810
However, there are really
strong data pointing to the fact

2093
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:29,810
that sauna, AKA deliberate hyperthermia,

2094
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,060
not too high, however,
that sauna can increase

2095
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:37,060
the release of growth
hormone and other hormones.

2096
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:39,120
And what's so dramatic
about this literature

2097
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,710
is the size of the
effects that are reported.

2098
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:43,543
So first of all,

2099
01:28:43,543 --> 01:28:46,400
let's talk about these
temperature increases.

2100
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,510
And yes, I will refer to
things that people can do

2101
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:52,370
even if you don't own a sauna

2102
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:54,810
because I realized not
everybody has a sauna

2103
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,060
in their backyard or
has access to a sauna.

2104
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,850
So first of all, recall our study

2105
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:03,610
about exercise where
warming up a few degrees

2106
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:08,010
before the exercise led to
bigger and quicker increases

2107
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:11,150
in growth hormone during
the exercise about itself.

2108
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:12,680
So that already point in the direction

2109
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,490
that temperature was important.

2110
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:17,740
Now, the degrees, no pun intended,

2111
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:21,680
that we're talking about
increasing body temperature

2112
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:25,180
is by entering saunas that are somewhere

2113
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:28,170
between 176 degrees Fahrenheit,

2114
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,663
so that's 80 degrees Celsius,

2115
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:36,590
and all the way up to like
210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit.

2116
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,520
I personally know people
that go even higher than that

2117
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,450
but they've trained themselves to deal

2118
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:42,340
with very high heats.

2119
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,780
And again, high heat is dangerous.

2120
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,650
You must clear this with your doctor.

2121
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,500
Now, what happens in high heat?

2122
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,780
A couple things happen in high heat.

2123
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,050
First of all,

2124
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,410
you start getting bigger
stroke volume of the heart.

2125
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,550
Kind of like an exercise.

2126
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,730
Once you get well-trained
in endurance activity,

2127
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:57,220
your stroke volume and the amount of blood

2128
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,663
that your heart can pump
each time gets larger.

2129
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,890
You dilate the blood vessels, right?

2130
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:04,040
There are a lot of
things that happen also.

2131
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:04,873
You're sweating.

2132
01:30:04,873 --> 01:30:06,693
Your body's trying to unload heat.

2133
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,460
Dilation of blood vessels,
arginine, increases in heat.

2134
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:14,670
We're starting to see
and hear a common theme.

2135
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:17,200
But it appears that getting into,

2136
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,360
I'm not saying getting the body

2137
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,847
up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,
I want to be very clear,

2138
01:30:20,847 --> 01:30:22,480
I'm not talking about getting the body

2139
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,930
up to 100 degrees Celsius.

2140
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:25,510
That would be terrible.

2141
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:26,450
You would die.

2142
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:30,210
But entering environments
where it's very hot

2143
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:31,410
for short periods of time,

2144
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:34,203
anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,

2145
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,020
where the temperature
is 80 degrees Celsius

2146
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:42,570
to 100 degrees Celsius or
175 degrees Fahrenheit,

2147
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:45,260
more or less, to about
210 degrees Fahrenheit,

2148
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:48,920
more or less, has been shown to increase

2149
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,770
growth hormone release 16 fold.

2150
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,200
That's right, 16 fold.

2151
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,830
That's 1,600%.

2152
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,060
Now, there are also
effects on other hormones,

2153
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,540
prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.

2154
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:04,030
So the pattern that was
described in this study

2155
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:05,780
and there've been many studies now.

2156
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:11,890
Endocrine effects of repeated
sauna were done in 17 humans.

2157
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,530
This was from doing this repeatedly.

2158
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,900
So it wasn't the first time they did this.

2159
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,940
They had to do this three days in a row.

2160
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:23,310
And the pattern was to get
into the sauna for 20 minutes,

2161
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:25,470
followed by a 30-minute cooling period.

2162
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:26,440
Remember, you don't want to spend

2163
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,770
long periods of time at high heat.

2164
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:30,910
You can cook your brain and other tissues.

2165
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:33,370
Be very careful as you
approach this if you decide to.

2166
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:36,590
But 30 minutes, excuse
me, 20 minutes sauna,

2167
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:38,160
followed by 30 minutes of cooling,

2168
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,650
followed by 20 minutes sauna again,

2169
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:42,720
led to a five fold
increase in growth hormone.

2170
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,160
And then by doing that
day after day after day,

2171
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:50,170
on the third day, you would
see these huge increases

2172
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:52,680
of like 16 fold, up to 16 fold.

2173
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,470
And there are now many studies like this.

2174
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:59,470
This was described a few
years ago, but since then,

2175
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,210
there've been a number of
other studies that have pointed

2176
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:07,920
in the direction of
deliberate hyperthermia,

2177
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,000
but not too hot that you kill yourself

2178
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,950
in order to increase growth hormone.

2179
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,790
And I know I keep highlighting
the dangers there,

2180
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:16,700
but again, anytime you're
going to mess with heat,

2181
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,020
you have to be cautious,
you have to be careful.

2182
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,950
So standard sauna can be useful.

2183
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:23,520
If you don't have access to a sauna,

2184
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,320
one way that people do this,

2185
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,670
we have to look to our
friends, the wrestlers, right?

2186
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:31,270
They wear plastics, which
are basically bodysuits

2187
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:32,860
that are fairly inexpensive

2188
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:37,860
that you can buy on any
online purchase platform,

2189
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:39,750
I should say.

2190
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:41,440
Some people in the old days

2191
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:46,440
before they had these plastic
things so readily available.

2192
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,700
I actually knew people
that wrapped themselves

2193
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,680
in garbage bags and then
throw on sweats and a hoodie

2194
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,200
and then go out for a jog.

2195
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,560
Again, you have to be really careful,

2196
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,590
especially on a hot day.

2197
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:56,720
Overheating can equate to death.

2198
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,980
But that's another way to heat up.

2199
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,640
You don't actually need a sauna.

2200
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,960
I've known people who will do this

2201
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:04,010
in hotel rooms while they're traveling.

2202
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:06,650
They'll turn on the heat,
you know, make a hot bath.

2203
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:08,440
They won't actually get in the bath

2204
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,340
but they'll fill the
room with steam and heat

2205
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:13,390
and they'll put on a
hoodie and some sweatshirt,

2206
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,760
sweat pants, and they'll sit there

2207
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,610
with wool socks on and they'll
get warm for 20 minutes,

2208
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:19,210
then they'll take a cool shower,

2209
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,820
and then they'll do it again.

2210
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,750
I guess when the hotel
is paying the water bill,

2211
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,120
you don't worry about it too much.

2212
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,560
Some people of course own saunas.

2213
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,393
There are a lot of ways to do that.

2214
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:27,770
I have friends who were in the military

2215
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:30,690
who made saunas out of cars
while they were overseas.

2216
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:31,730
All sorts of things.

2217
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:32,930
You do have to be careful.

2218
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,230
I know I've said it many, many times.

2219
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:35,770
I just don't want anyone
to hurt themselves.

2220
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,090
But these increases in growth
hormone are tremendous.

2221
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:40,280
And what they probably stem from

2222
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,920
are increased activity of
neurons within the hypothalamus

2223
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,860
that stimulate growth hormone
release from the pituitary.

2224
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,160
And that's probably

2225
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,700
because the growth
hormone-releasing hormone neurons

2226
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,470
in the hypothalamus sit very closely

2227
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:57,210
and may even be intermixed
with some of the neurons

2228
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:00,810
in the hypothalamus that regulate
heat and body temperature.

2229
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:03,540
Remember, metabolism is impart a heat.

2230
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,150
It's like a furnace of how
much energy you're consuming

2231
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:11,120
and using for building or
for energy usage purposes.

2232
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,690
So sauna can be very, very interesting.

2233
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,150
And again, it's 20
minutes, 30-minute cooling,

2234
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:20,300
20 minutes again, proceed
with extreme caution,

2235
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,230
but nonetheless, these
are pretty extreme effects

2236
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:25,110
in terms of their abilities

2237
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:27,400
to increase growth hormone levels.

2238
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,500
Along the lines of
temperature and hormones,

2239
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,480
I just want to mention
a very recent study,

2240
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:32,750
it just came out.

2241
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:35,307
March, April, 2021,

2242
01:34:35,307 --> 01:34:38,040
"Endocrine Effects of
Repeated Hot Thermal Stress

2243
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,520
and Cold Water Immersion
in Young Adult Men."

2244
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,530
Unfortunately, it was just in men,

2245
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:42,670
they didn't look at women,

2246
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:44,640
but nonetheless I think
the data are relevant

2247
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,640
to everybody as a general theme.

2248
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,880
This is Podstawski et al.

2249
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,520
I will put a link to
the study in the caption

2250
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,710
and they looked at testosterone,

2251
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:57,040
prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.

2252
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,170
And what they found was that the sauna

2253
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:04,190
does indeed lead to a
significant decrease in cortisol,

2254
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:07,080
a stress hormone, a hormone
that you want to be released

2255
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,770
early in the day when you wake up.

2256
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:13,350
But sauna definitely led to
significant decrease in cortisol

2257
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:17,540
but did not change testosterone,
DHEA or prolactin levels.

2258
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,110
So that's interesting.

2259
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:23,150
And it turns out that the cold did affect

2260
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:25,870
some of these hormones
but the results there

2261
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:27,640
were a little bit more mixed.

2262
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,000
So the takeaway here is that heat

2263
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,620
seems to have positive
effects on growth hormone,

2264
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:33,453
big effects.

2265
01:35:33,453 --> 01:35:35,090
It seems to have positive effects

2266
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:37,660
on reducing cortisol levels.

2267
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:39,680
And it does not seem to have effects

2268
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,820
on things like testosterone,
DHEA, or prolactin directly.

2269
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:44,670
You can imagine that
a shift in any hormone

2270
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:48,050
is going to alter the levels of
other hormones down the lines

2271
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,440
or have indirect effects

2272
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:52,800
but in terms of direct effects just during

2273
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,040
or immediately after the sauna
bath, there were no effects.

2274
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,580
So we've talked about
diet, supplementation,

2275
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:02,590
behavioral tools.

2276
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:03,900
And of course, we talked

2277
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,840
about the underlying biology and logic.

2278
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,100
And hopefully you heard
the safety precautions

2279
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,870
for all of those.

2280
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:13,750
Now, I'd like to just briefly talk

2281
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:17,390
about the prescription side of all this.

2282
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:21,610
There are, as we know, many
people taking growth hormone

2283
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:23,450
because it's been prescribed
to them by a doctor.

2284
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:25,620
And presumably there are
people taking growth hormone

2285
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,900
even though it has not been
prescribed by a doctor,

2286
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:30,080
which is none of my business.

2287
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:33,880
But the point here is that most all

2288
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,300
of the hormones that we
make have been synthesized.

2289
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,780
So there are versions of them

2290
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:42,073
in little bottles or little
ampules that people can inject.

2291
01:36:42,998 --> 01:36:44,800
Here are a couple of
important things to consider

2292
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,900
if you're going to go that route.

2293
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:49,310
First of all, talk to
a physician, all right?

2294
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:51,360
They actually are only legally available

2295
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,360
through a physician.

2296
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,730
Second of all, anytime
you're injecting something,

2297
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:57,580
you're going to shut
down your own production.

2298
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,430
That's the way that the
hormone system works.

2299
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:02,830
If you take thyroid hormone,
you won't make thyroid hormone,

2300
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:04,100
at least in the long run.

2301
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,500
If you take testosterone,

2302
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,550
you will shut down your own
production of testosterone.

2303
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:12,960
If you take estrogen, the
system's a little more resilient

2304
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,190
but eventually you will shut down

2305
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:15,720
your production of estrogen.

2306
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,060
And the same is true for growth hormone.

2307
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:22,440
So a decision to go that
route of taking something

2308
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,170
is often not always a
decision to do it forever.

2309
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:27,690
However, if you're willing
to sustain a period

2310
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:30,010
of being without a given hormone,

2311
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:33,480
some people can do things
and then stop taking them,

2312
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,470
and then wait out the period

2313
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:38,040
in which they're not making testosterone,

2314
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,070
estrogen or growth hormone,

2315
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:40,210
and then it will come back,

2316
01:37:40,210 --> 01:37:41,963
sometimes and sometimes it won't.

2317
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:46,100
There's a kind of new
area that's developing now

2318
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,210
that I think deserves our attention,

2319
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:51,360
not because I'm encouraging it,
but because it is happening.

2320
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,040
And in keeping with the
science and in keeping

2321
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,950
with trying to keep things
modern, it's worth us discussing.

2322
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:00,470
And those are peptides.

2323
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:03,000
So these days you hear
a lot about peptides.

2324
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,120
I'd like to clarify a little
bit about what peptides are.

2325
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:10,860
Peptides is a really huge
category of biological compounds.

2326
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,970
Peptides are just strings
of amino acids, right?

2327
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:16,420
So we've talked about
L-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.

2328
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,280
Those are amino acids.

2329
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,810
Those are individual amino acids.

2330
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:23,010
And those are put together
into little small peptides

2331
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:25,250
or they're what are called polypeptides,

2332
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,063
which are just longer peptides.

2333
01:38:28,245 --> 01:38:31,360
It turns out that for any
substance like growth hormone

2334
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,970
or growth hormone-releasing hormone,

2335
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:34,560
it's made up of different amino acids

2336
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,580
in different sequences,

2337
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:38,710
just like your genes
are made up of As and Gs

2338
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:41,070
and Cs and Ts, nucleotides
in different sequences.

2339
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:42,323
It's like a recipe.

2340
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:48,130
Peptides tend to be short
sequences of amino acids

2341
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:51,590
that resemble a hormone enough or resemble

2342
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:54,300
some other peptide enough that it can lead

2343
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,140
to the similar same effects
when you inject them.

2344
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:01,360
So for example, we make growth
hormone-releasing hormone

2345
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,260
from our brain which
stimulates growth hormone

2346
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,093
from the pituitary.

2347
01:39:04,093 --> 01:39:07,090
You're probably getting tired
of me saying that by now.

2348
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:11,660
But people now will take
things like sermorelin,

2349
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:16,660
S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,

2350
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:19,570
which is not the entire peptide sequence

2351
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:21,510
of growth hormone-releasing hormone

2352
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:23,090
but it's a subset of those.

2353
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:24,210
And when people inject it

2354
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:25,520
before they go to sleep at night

2355
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,650
is typically how it's
done on an empty stomach.

2356
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:30,210
Then that stimulates the
release of growth hormone

2357
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:31,330
from the pituitary.

2358
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,560
So this is not taking growth hormone,

2359
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:36,060
this is taking the stimulating hormone

2360
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:40,210
or what's often called a
secretagogue or a mimic, all right?

2361
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:44,050
It causes a secretion of
the hormone that one wants.

2362
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,760
People will do this for
thyroid hormone, too.

2363
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,290
Some people are doing this

2364
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:49,280
by prescription with a real medical need.

2365
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,150
Other people are doing it
for just longevity reasons,

2366
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:54,100
which kind of falls into that gray zone

2367
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,810
of they wouldn't die without it,

2368
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:58,640
but they want to enhance their
life and so they're doing that

2369
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,473
because they believe

2370
01:39:59,473 --> 01:40:01,750
it's the right thing
for them, prescription.

2371
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,110
Sermorelin is prescription.

2372
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:03,990
Do they work?

2373
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:05,520
Yes.

2374
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,030
Do they shut down your natural production

2375
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:10,770
of growth hormone-releasing hormone?

2376
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:13,340
Well, there, the answer is yes

2377
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:16,400
but some of these peptides
actually have the effect

2378
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,410
of changing gene expression.

2379
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:19,690
Remember, way back to the beginning

2380
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:21,020
when I was talking about hormones,

2381
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,760
they can actually change gene expression

2382
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,630
and they can actually
set pathways in motion

2383
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:27,580
for continued production of a hormone

2384
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,920
even if you stop taking the compound.

2385
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,770
Now, that can be good or that can be bad

2386
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,793
because as you recall, growth hormone,

2387
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:37,040
big increases in growth
hormone that are short-lived

2388
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:40,320
like sauna, or, you know,
I should say exercise

2389
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,723
or arginine or sauna, it seems
like has these huge effects.

2390
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,480
Or early nights, you
know, first phase of sleep

2391
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,920
early in the night, these sorts of things.

2392
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,740
Those are transient.

2393
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:56,300
But when one is injecting over
and over at constant level,

2394
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:59,320
you can put into action
gene expression programs

2395
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,440
that can be long lived.

2396
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:03,450
And let's say, you have a
particular tumor in the body.

2397
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:05,570
Tumors will grow when
they see growth hormone

2398
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:08,350
even if that tumor is
unhealthy for you, right?

2399
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:10,120
You've got growth of
tissues all over the body.

2400
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,440
So again, I'm not saying whether or not

2401
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,120
people should do these
things or not doing them.

2402
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:16,740
One thing I do know is that
they are in very prominent use

2403
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:17,820
in the movie industry.

2404
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:19,700
People who want to peel
off body fat quickly,

2405
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,800
they do increase recovery time.

2406
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:22,950
They increase healing rates.

2407
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,190
People are also injecting
things like gastric peptides.

2408
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:28,240
They're actually stomach peptides

2409
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:30,080
that we talked about in
the previous episode,

2410
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,730
things related to the ghrelin pathway

2411
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:35,810
and other things from the
liver that can improve

2412
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:37,620
the rate of tissue and wound healing.

2413
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,960
You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics,

2414
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,470
lot of people are using
peptides and compounds

2415
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:44,840
and I'm not pointing fingers
at anyone in particular.

2416
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,320
It's just this is separate
from hormone augmentation

2417
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,040
of like injecting GH or
injecting testosterone.

2418
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,710
People are now working
further up the pathways.

2419
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,410
Other names of some of
the peptides are things

2420
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:58,970
like ipamorelin, tesamorelin.

2421
01:41:58,970 --> 01:42:00,870
Some of these have clinical uses.

2422
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:03,630
Others have just been made as compounds

2423
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:06,820
for people in the kind of longevity field

2424
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,650
or the self-augmentation
field, if you will.

2425
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:11,290
So again, not promoting their use

2426
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:12,260
but they're definitely out there.

2427
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,170
And so now if you hear about them

2428
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,650
or if someone's talking to you about them,

2429
01:42:15,650 --> 01:42:17,210
now hopefully you have
a better understanding

2430
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:18,620
about their underlying biology.

2431
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,070
And you can think rationally

2432
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:23,820
about whether or not they are
the right decision for you.

2433
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:28,120
Okay, once again, covered an
enormous amount of material.

2434
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,380
Hopefully, now you
understand thyroid hormone

2435
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,780
and what it does and a little
bit about its mechanism

2436
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:35,350
or maybe a lot and growth
hormone and what it does

2437
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:38,960
and how both of them take
care of our metabolism.

2438
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,500
They dictate how many nutrients
we can eat and make use of.

2439
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,670
They can pull from body fat stores,

2440
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:46,510
repair muscle, repair cartilage.

2441
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:48,550
They really are incredible compounds.

2442
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:50,070
And they're actionable.

2443
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:51,010
They're things that we can do,

2444
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:53,510
like getting that early phase of sleep,

2445
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:56,660
perhaps supplementing
with arginine, maybe not,

2446
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:59,100
hopefully getting adequate exercise,

2447
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,820
warming up properly, not
making the exercise too long

2448
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:05,330
or too intense will help,
maybe sauna or things like it.

2449
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:08,290
You know, deliberate, safe hyperthermia,

2450
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:11,670
with the emphasis on safe,
might be things that are of use.

2451
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:13,210
Regardless, even if you're not interested

2452
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:16,060
in the thyroid or the
growth hormone pathways,

2453
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,280
this brings to a close
our month on hormones.

2454
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,150
And so now hopefully you understand

2455
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:21,670
not just thyroid and growth hormone

2456
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:24,370
but the logic that
underlies thyroid hormone,

2457
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:27,710
growth hormone, estrogen,
testosterone, why we eat,

2458
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:31,200
why we stop eating,
cholecystokinin, ghrelin.

2459
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,070
If these names don't mean anything to you,

2460
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:35,150
then perhaps go back and
listen to those episodes.

2461
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:37,080
But regardless, I hope that you come away

2462
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:40,530
from this with a deeper
understanding about these hormones

2463
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:42,830
which are so powerful in controlling

2464
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:44,230
the way our brain functions

2465
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:46,680
and the interplay between
the brain and hormones

2466
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:50,110
because it is really a
bidirectional conversation.

2467
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:52,210
The brain is telling body
what hormones to make.

2468
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:54,480
The hormones are influencing
all the tissues of the body

2469
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,780
but also telling the brain

2470
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:57,500
whether or not to eat more or grow more

2471
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,960
or think more, et cetera.

2472
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,820
So I really appreciate

at the beginning of the podcast episode,

2495
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,730
that really helps us.

2496
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:56,500
We also have a Patreon account.

2497
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,870
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2498
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:01,330
There, you can support the podcast

2499
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,610
at any level that you like.

2500
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:06,350
And I mentioned supplements this episode.

2501
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:07,860
I often mention supplements.

2502
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:09,450
They are certainly not necessary,

2503
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,330
but for those of you
interested in supplements,

2504
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:14,660
we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E

2505
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:17,220
because Thorne has the
highest levels of stringency

2506
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:19,170
in terms of the quality of the ingredients

2507
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:22,490
and the amount of the
ingredients in each capsule,

2508
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,660
tablet, powder, et cetera.

2509
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,970
If you want to see the
supplements that I take,

2510
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:28,890
as well as get a discount on any of those

2511
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:31,230
or any of the supplements
that Thorne makes,

2512
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:36,230
it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
dot com slash the letter U,

2513
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:37,640
slash Huberman.

2514
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:40,290
And you can get 20% off any
of the supplements they make.

2515
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:43,160
I should mention Thorne
works with the Mayo Clinic.

2516
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,110
They partnered with them.

2517
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:45,930
They worked with all
the major sports teams.

2518
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:48,010
So really the highest
levels of stringency.

2519
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:50,240
We're quite happy to be working with them.

2520
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,510
And last but not least, I thank you

2521
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:54,560
for your time and attention and above all,

2522
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,198
for your interest in science.
