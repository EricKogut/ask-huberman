00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,940
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,102
where we discuss science,

3
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:06,323
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,765
I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

5
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:15,580
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,350
Today, we are discussing grief.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,020
Grief is a natural emotion

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,753
that most everybody experiences
at some point in their life.

9
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,600
However, grief is something

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,830
that still mystifies most people.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,540
For instance, we often wonder

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,340
why getting over the loss
of somebody, or a pet,

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,340
is so absolutely crushing.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,870
In some cases it's obvious,

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,850
because we had a very close relationship

16
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,730
to that person or animal,

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,370
but in other cases, it's bewildering,

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,900
because somehow, despite our best efforts,

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,910
we are unable to reframe
and shift our mind

20
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,790
to the idea that the person or animal

21
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,010
that at one point was
here, and so very present,

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,620
is now gone.

23
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,940
Today we are going to discuss
how we conceptualize grief,

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,970
both at an emotional
and at a logical level.

25
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,860
I'm going to teach you
about the neuroscience

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,850
and the psychology of grief,

27
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,360
and incredible findings
that have been made

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,760
in just a few key laboratories,

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,500
that point to the fact

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,070
that we essentially map
our experience of people

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,563
in three dimensions.

32
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:21,356
I'll just give you a little hint

33
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,730
of what those dimensions are.

34
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,470
They relate to space, where people are,

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,130
time, when people are,

36
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,570
I'll explain what that means,

37
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,160
and a dimension called closeness,

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,730
and how those three dimensions

39
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,840
of space, time, and closeness

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,100
are what establish very
close bonds with people,

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,390
and are what require remapping,

42
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,870
reorganization within
our emotional framework

43
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,510
and our logical framework,

44
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,500
when we lose somebody,
for whatever reason.

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,619
Within that understanding,

46
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,232
I'm confident that you
will have greater insight

47
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:54,610
into the grief process.

48
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,320
And should you ever find yourself

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,560
within the grief process,

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,170
as I imagine most everyone
will at some point,

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,038
you will be able to navigate that process

52
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:06,230
in what psychologists and
neuroscientists deem to be

53
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,250
the most healthy way
of going through grief.

54
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,479
Indeed, moving through grief

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,380
requires a specific
form of neuroplasticity,

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,930
a reordering of brain connections,

57
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,760
and also the connections
between the brain and body.

58
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,750
I'm going to teach you
about all of that today,

59
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,000
so you're going to learn a
lot of scientific information.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,148
You will also learn a lot of tools

61
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:27,050
that you can put in your kit

62
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,710
of emotional and really,
emotional physical tools,

63
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,290
that will allow you to move through grief

64
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,060
in this healthy way that
I referred to earlier.

65
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,810
I'll also point out some
of the myths about grief.

66
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,290
For instance, many of
you have probably heard

67
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,320
that there are designated stages of grief

68
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,080
that everybody moves through.

69
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,344
Turns out that recent
research refutes that idea.

70
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:48,120
There are different stages of grief,

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,380
but not everybody experiences all of them,

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,590
and hardly ever does somebody

73
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,210
move through all of those linearly,

74
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,740
meaning in the same order.

75
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,850
I also want to point
out that for many of you

76
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,980
that are not experiencing
grief in this moment,

77
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,230
there's an important scientific literature

78
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,090
that teaches us that
how we show up to grief,

79
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,640
meaning our psychological
and our biological state

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,320
that we happen to be
in when a loss occurs,

81
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,470
strongly dictates whether or not we end up

82
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,810
in what's called complicated
or non-complicated grief.

83
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,110
And non-complicated
grief is a form of grief

84
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,690
that is very prolonged,

85
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,120
and in fact often requires

86
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,880
that people get substantial
professional help.

87
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,197
So whether or not you're
experiencing grief that's mild,

88
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:35,160
moderate, or very intense right now,

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,696
or whether or not you are not
experiencing any grief at all,

90
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,780
you're going to learn
scientific information

91
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,820
and tools that will help you navigate

92
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,350
through this process that we call grief.

93
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,130
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

94
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,500
that this podcast is separate

95
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,920
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

96
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,130
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

97
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,240
to bring zero cost to consumer information

98
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,180
about science and science-related tools

99
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,610
to the general public.

100
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,690
In keeping with that theme,

101
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,500
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

102
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,090
Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.

103
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,620
Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers that have cooling,

104
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,970
heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.

105
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,600
I recently started sleeping

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,870
with an Eight Sleep mattress cover,

107
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,766
and I am so glad that I did,

108
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:19,930
because the sleep that
I'm getting is superb

109
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,820
compared to the sleep I
was getting previously.

110
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,500
I always thought that I slept pretty well,

111
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,600
especially since I apply a
number of different tools

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,750
in order to sleep well,
things like supplements,

113
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,960
things like keeping the
room cool, et cetera.

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,770
But I have had a repeating
problem over the years,

115
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,940
which is that I would wake up

116
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,500
in the middle of the night often,

117
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,247
and sometimes have a bit of trouble

118
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:40,290
or a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.

119
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,628
I would have to apply other tools

120
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,290
in order to get back to sleep.

121
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,670
Eight Sleep allows me to
adjust the temperature

122
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,870
of my mattress and my
sleeping environment,

123
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,450
so that I fall asleep easily,

124
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,330
and stay asleep throughout the night,

125
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,480
which as many of you
know is a game changer.

126
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,307
Temperature is a powerful
regulator of sleep

127
00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:58,820
and the ability to get into sleep.

128
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,850
We know, for instance,

129
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,760
that the body needs to drop
by one to three degrees

130
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,850
in order to get into
sleep and to stay asleep.

131
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,800
And with Eight Sleep,

132
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,530
I can program the temperature of my bed

133
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,270
so that it gets cooler as I fall asleep,

134
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,887
gets even colder as I enter deep sleep,

135
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:13,970
and at the transition to REM sleep,

136
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,990
rapid eye movement sleep, it
can get even cooler if I like.

137
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,640
I actually like to maintain
the same temperature

138
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,970
through deep and REM sleep.

139
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,700
And then it heats up slightly
as I head towards morning,

140
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,380
because of course heating up of the body

141
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,387
is one way in which we wake up.

142
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:30,011
So I have this nice contour
of cooling and heating

143
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,250
that puts me through a beautiful arc

144
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,740
of falling and staying asleep,

145
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,180
and waking up when I want to.

146
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,410

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,480
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

158
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,610
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

159
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,440
that analyzes data from
your blood and DNA,

160
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,030
to help you better understand your body

161
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,130
and help you reach your health goals.

162
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,290
I've long been a believer

163
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,100
in getting regular blood work done,

164
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,230
for the simple reason
that many of the factors

165
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,051
that impact your immediate
and long-term health

166
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,970
can only be assessed from
a quality blood test.

167
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,870
And nowadays with the
advent of modern DNA tests,

168
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,900
you can also get insight
into, for instance,

169
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,430
what your biological
age is, and compare that

170
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,540
to your chronological age.

171
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,870
And of course your biological age

172
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,360
is the number that truly matters.

173
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,840
One issue with a lot of blood tests

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,780
and DNA tests out there, however,

175
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,570
is that you get values back
about metabolic factors,

176
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,680
hormones, and lipids, et cetera,

177
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,618
but you don't know what to
do with that information.

178
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,760
InsideTracker solves that problem.

179
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,410
They have a very easy-to-use
personalized platform.

180
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,340
It's a website where you can
literally place your cursor

181
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,540
over a given value,

182
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,450
say for a hormone or
metabolic factor or lipid,

183
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,330
and it will tell you what you can do

184
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,810
in terms of nutrition,
behaviors, and supplementation

185
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,760
in order to bring those
values into the range

186
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,200
that are optimal for you and your health.

187
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Find this immensely useful
and very easy to use.

Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

194
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,975
ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

195
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,080
that are the absolute highest quality

196
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,840
and have extreme versatility

197
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,820
in terms of what they can be used for,

198
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,743
and when you wear them.

199
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:31,190
What do I mean by that?

200
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,390
Well, the company was founded

201
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,580
by two All-American
swimmers from Stanford,

202
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,990
and their goal was to develop
eyeglasses for performance,

203
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,930
things like running and
biking and so forth.

204
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,230
And you can certainly wear
them for those activities.

205
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,130
And I do wear them for those activities.

206
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,970
I wear readers at night.

207
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,680
I also wear sunglasses sometimes,

208
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,053
when it's very bright out.

209
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,070
One of the things that's terrific

210
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,110
about ROKA sunglasses
and eyeglasses, however,

211
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,070
is that they're not
just designed for sport.

212
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,650
They have a terrific aesthetic,

213
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,180
and you can also wear them out to dinner,

214
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,910
to work, and so on.

215
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,080
I say this because at least in my opinion,

216
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,360
a lot of so-called sport eyeglasses

217
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,100
or high-performance
eyeglasses and sunglasses

218
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,680
make people look like cyborgs.

219
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,190
ROKA, the aesthetic is really terrific.

220
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,330
They're extremely lightweight
and they don't slip off,

221
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,400
even when you're sweaty.

222
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,760
So you can indeed wear them on a hot day,

223
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,200
or when running or cycling.

224
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,270
They're not going to slip off your face.

225
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,290
They're so lightweight, in fact,

226
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,300
that I often forget
that they're on my face.

227
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,930

and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

233
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,559
Okay, let's talk about grief.

234
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,709
I just want to remind you that everybody,

235
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,130
at some point in their
life, experiences grief,

236
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,140
either mild grief, moderate
grief, or extreme grief,

237
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,800
and it's somewhat obvious,
but worth stating nonetheless,

238
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,870
that how intense grief feels,

239
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,350
and how long it lasts,

240
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,340
scales with how close
we were with somebody.

241
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,750
And if you learn that the person

242
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,880
who works at the coffee shop

243
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,953
or that you see at the coffee
shop on a regular basis,

244
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,500
happened to pass away

245
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,638
or tragically get killed
in a car accident,

246
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,410
that can be quite upsetting.

247
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,298
It can be somewhat disorienting to you

248
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,850
if you, for instance,
just saw them yesterday

249
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,060
or they seemed perfectly
fine when you saw them last.

250
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,000
But of course the grief that results

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,970
from the loss of somebody

252
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,140
to whom you have that level of attachment

253
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,010
is far and away different
than the level of grief

254
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,640
that you would experience

255
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,090
from the death of a very close loved one,

256
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,223
a sibling, a parent, God forbid a child.

257
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,950
When that type of loss occurs,

258
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,910
it's often the case

259
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,650
that our entire relationship
to life feels different.

260
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,780
Places and things that at once
brought us joy and laughter

261
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,390
now bring the opposite.

262
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,020
They bring us intense
feelings of sadness and loss.

263
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,820
Psychologists and neuroscientists

264
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,960
distinguish between complicated grief

265
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,573
and non-complicated grief.

266
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,370
They are very similar at the outset.

267
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,500
One of the fundamental
differences between them, however,

268
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,700
is that complicated grief,

269
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,380
which occurs in about one in 10 people,

270
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,790
is a situation in which grief

271
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,760
does not seem to resolve itself,

272
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,660
even after a prolonged period of time.

273
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,030
Later in the episode, I'll point you

274
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,470
to the actual tests that are used.

275
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,890
I've provided links to those
in the show note captions,

276
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,620
that will allow you to distinguish

277
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,900
between complicated and
non-complicated grief.

278
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,170
These arrive through
the important research

279
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,077
of the world-class grief
researchers that are out there

280
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:31,610
and the psychologists that treat grief.

281
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,610
The important thing to point
out is that grief is a process.

282
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,770
Like any biological or
psychological event,

283
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,280
it has a beginning, a middle and an end.

284
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,200
And I do believe that being able to orient

285
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,550
in terms of where you are in that process

286
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,570
can be immensely beneficial,

287
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,140
not just for predicting how
long it's going to last,

288
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,480
but in order to conceptualize
the person or animal

289
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,260
that you lost, in a way that allows you

290
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,810
to best preserve their memory

291
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,060
while maintaining your own
functional capacity in life.

292
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,030
Along those lines, I want to point out

293
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,900
that grief and depression,

294
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,140
while they can feel quite
similar in certain ways,

295
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,110
and have overlapping symptomatology,

296
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,380
loss of appetite, challenges sleeping,

297
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,560
crying in the middle of the day

298
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,480
for no apparent reason, et cetera,

299
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,140
they are distinctly different processes.

300
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,330
The modern research
teaches us for instance,

301
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,630
that grief rarely responds
well to antidepressants,

302
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,690
whereas depression can often

303
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,380
respond well to antidepressants.

304
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,280
Everything we know and
understand about grief

305
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,870
is that it is a distinct psychological

306
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,030
and physiological event

307
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,300
in the brain and body from depression.

308
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,310
Rather, perhaps the best
way to think about grief

309
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,480
is that it is actually
a motivational state.

310
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,580
It is a yearning.

311
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,130
It is a desire for something,

312
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,870
and somewhat surprisingly,

313
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,110
it's not just a desire
to have that person back,

314
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,940
or to have that animal back.

315
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,630
You might think, "Well, that's
crazy, of course it is."

316
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,460
But of course, there are instances

317
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,180
in which someone passing away
or an animal passing away

318
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,100
is actually providing
relief for that person,

319
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,400
because of where they
happen to be in their life.

320
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,640
Today, I'll teach you about
grief as a motivational process,

321
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,150
because grief as a motivational process

322
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,020
really is the way that
scientists and psychologists

323
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,810
now conceptualize grief, and
the treatments for grief,

324
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,120
so that people can move
through them effectively.

325
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,610
As we wade into this important topic,

326
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,630
I'd like to emphasize
some of the common myths

327
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,890
and misunderstandings about grief.

328
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,930
Some of the myths and
misunderstanding arrive

329
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,030
from the beautiful work
of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,

330
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,210
a psychologist who wrote the
famous book on death and dying.

331
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,040
And I should emphasize
that while Kubler-Ross

332
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,380
was a real pioneer in establishing

333
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,360
that there are indeed
different stages of grief,

334
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,850
the modern science, both
psychology and neuroscience,

335
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,380
point to the fact that not everybody

336
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,650
experiences all of the stages
that Kubler-Ross defined,

337
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,820
nor do they move through those
stages in a linear manner.

338
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,810
Sometimes they're out of sequence.

339
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,520
I'll just highlight the five stages

340
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,170
that Kubler-Ross illustrated,

341
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,210
because some people really
do experience all of them,

342
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,830
sometimes in the order I'll read them.

343
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,660
But again, oftentimes they don't.

344
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,810
The different stages
of grief, very quickly,

345
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,550
are denial, anger, bargaining,

346
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,540
depression, and acceptance.

347
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,780
In the Kubler-Ross model,

348
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,880
denial is always the first stage,

349
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,700
and denial is just as it sounds,

350
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,130
this disbelief, it cannot
be, there's no way,

351
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,760
a refusal to accept the new reality

352
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,890
that the person or animal is gone.

353
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,720
The second stage, anger,

354
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
is one in which the individual recognizes

355
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,530
that the person is indeed gone,

356
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,620
or the animal is gone,

357
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,080
but their body and their mind
go into a motivated state.

358
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,913
This is important.

359
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:42,750
We're going to return
to this idea of grief

360
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,298
as a motivated state that
involves action plans,

361
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:48,920
in more depth as we go further.

362
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,530
And then the third stage is bargaining,

363
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,940
what's sometimes called
the negotiating phase,

364
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,880
this idea that, well,
if I had just done this,

365
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,960
or if they had just done that,

366
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,130
or if I had called more,

367
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,180
or somehow refusing to accept the reality.

368
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,847
So in a way this can be blended
with denial in thinking,

369
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,640
"Well, if I just don't think about it,

370
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,130
it won't be real," this kind of thing.

371
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,950
So again, stages can be
blended or braided together,

372
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,750
because emotions are complex, right?

373
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,590
Even though there are different
stages to this process,

374
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,470
they can sometimes be melded together.

375
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,810
The fourth stage of depression
that Kubler-Ross described

376
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,770
is one of, why go on living?

377
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,030
Why should I go on living?

378
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,890
Why should I continue in
this grief-stricken state

379
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,590
that seems to deprive me
of all the richness of life

380
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,390
that I experienced when the
person or animal was still here.

381
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,890
And then the fifth stage is acceptance.

382
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,690
This internalization,
not just cognitively,

383
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,770
not just thinking,

384
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,440
but emotionally that
it's going to be okay,

385
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,270
that not just this too shall
pass, but that it has passed.

386
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,910
So again, the five stages of grief

387
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,500
that Kubler-Ross defined
were immensely important

388
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,410
as a critical parsing
of the different stages

389
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,190
that one could move through.

390
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,870
But unfortunately those five stages

391
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,320
were sort of taken to be
gospel for a long time.

392
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,010
And we now know, based on neuroimaging,

393
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,640
based on more in-depth
psychological evaluation,

394
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,510
and frankly, more
researchers and clinicians

395
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,460
moving into this area and observing

396
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,330
that while much of what
Kubler-Ross described

397
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,000
does hold true, it's not always the case.

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,690
And in fact, the contour
of the grief process

399
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,170
actually has a lot of dimensions

400
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,960
that are not encapsulated
by those five stages.

401
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,250
There's also a lot of variation,

402
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,590
depending on whether or not the loss

403
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,640
is due to old age, disease,

404
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,300
whether or not there was
suffering prior or not,

405
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,550
suicide or non-suicide
type deaths and losses,

406
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,211
and even grief about non-death losses,

407
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:45,390
a relationship breakup,
or something of that sort,

408
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,100
or even homesickness
and things of that sort.

409
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,890
So I do want to tip our
hats to the incredible work

410
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,660
of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.

411
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,030
By no means am I or do other researchers

412
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,630
try and discount her
incredible contributions.

413
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,890
But I think nowadays we have
a different and frankly,

414
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,770
a better understanding of what
the grief process is like,

415
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,130
and as a consequence, better
tools to move through grief.

416
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,540
In order to really
understand what grief is

417
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,010
in your brain and body,

418
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,300
and how to best navigate grief,

419
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,940
I'd like you to do an experiment with me.

420
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,050
For the next five minutes or so,

421
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,780
I'd like you to at least try to discard

422
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,460
of all prior notions of grief

423
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,220
as just a state of sadness.

424
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,850
I want to acknowledge that it is

425
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,940
and does involve sadness,

426
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,530
but for right now,

427
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,860
let's think about grief
as a motivational state,

428
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,810
as a desire for something specific.

429
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,480
In fact, I'd like you to think about grief

430
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,800
as an attempt to reach out

431
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,350
and get something that you very much want.

432
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,230
Imagine yourself extremely
thirsty, for instance,

433
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,930
on a very hot day,

434
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,120
and a glass of water is
right in front of you.

435
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,790
And it's a beautiful,
clean glass of water,

436
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,510
and it's completely full,

437
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,680
and you so badly want to drink that water.

438
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,480
But no matter how intensely you want it,

439
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,790
and no matter how hard
you try and reach it,

440
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,210
it always shifts just outside your reach.

441
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,760
So if you can imagine that,
even just a little bit,

442
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,700
you are touching into
the experience of grief.

443
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,060
How do I know this?

444
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,138
Well, I know this because
brain imaging studies

445
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,349
involving what's called
functional magnetic

446
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,569
resonance imaging, FMRI,

447
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,939
in which you can evaluate

448
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,090
which brain areas are
more active than others,

449
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,280
according to blood flow,

450
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,880
which correlates with neural
activity and so forth,

451
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,130
teaches us that the brain areas

452
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,430
that are associated with
motivation and craving and pursuit

453
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,300
are some of the primary
brain areas and circuits

454
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,460
that are activated in states of grief.

455
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,040
I'd like to share an
important paper with you,

456
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,070
as one of the first to illustrate the fact

457
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,810
that grief is not just a
state of sadness and pain.

458
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,920
It is indeed a state of
yearning and desire of something

459
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,160
that is just outside your reach,

460
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,450
and unfortunately will always
be just outside your reach

461
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,760
until you remap your relationship
to that person or thing.

462
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,660
The title of this paper is
posed first as a question,

463
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,190
so that's why I'll read it as such.

464
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,170
The title is "Craving Love?

465
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,950
Enduring Grief Activates
Brain's Reward Center."

466
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,300
And the first author of this paper

467
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,580
is Mary-Frances O'Connor.

468
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,002
She's a professor of psychology

469
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,570
at the University of Arizona,

470
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,520
and one of the world leaders
in the study of grief

471
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,030
from a neuroscience perspective.

472
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,160
With some luck, we'll get her here

473
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,623
on the podcast as a guest.

474
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,880
Now this paper has several
important features.

475
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,230
I'll just highlight a few.

476
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,980
One of the features of this
paper that's not surprising

477
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,810
is they found that people
who are in a state of grief

478
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,980
are in a state of pain.

479
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,080
That is, brain areas associated with pain,

480
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,670
actual physical pain, are more active

481
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,740
than in non-grieving individuals.

482
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,250
However, they also found that
people who are experiencing

483
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,000
what's called complicated grief

484
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,520
showed reward-related activity

485
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,820
in a brain area called
the nucleus accumbens.

486
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,310
What is reward-related activity?

487
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,130
Reward-related activity
is activity of neurons

488
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,210
that's associated with
motivational states.

489
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,800
And the nucleus accumbens
is a brain center

490
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,170
in which dopamine has the effect

491
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,700
of creating a motivated state.

492
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,750
If ever you thought that dopamine

493
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,950
was only associated with feeling good,

494
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,640
you hear about dopamine hits,

495
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,280
well, this paper and papers like it,

496
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,010
firmly tell us that dopamine
is not about feeling good.

497
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,490
Dopamine is about placing us into a state

498
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,513
of desiring things and seeking things.

499
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,280
This is true in addiction.

500
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,010
This is true when we're
hungry and we want to eat.

501
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,620
This is true when we want to reproduce.

502
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,570
This is true in every state

503
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,140
in which we are reaching for something

504
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,380
outside our immediate ability

505
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,210
to give that thing to ourselves.

506
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,380
This is very important to understand,

507
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,760
if you want to understand grief

508
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,470
and how to move through grief.

509
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,660
Grief is not just about sadness.

510
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,200
It is a state of sadness,

511
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,350
hence the activation of brain
areas associated with pain,

512
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,350
and it is a state of desire
and reaching for something.

513
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,640
And for those of you that
have experienced grief,

514
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,440
I think that will resonate with you.

515
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,320
In that understanding that
grief is both a state of pain,

516
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,040
but also a state of wanting,

517
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,230
and in the understanding
that when we lose somebody,

518
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,953
either because of breakup
or because of death,

519
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,580
or if an animal dies or gets
taken away or is missing,

520
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,230
that state of wanting and desire

521
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,180
drives an activation state within us.

522
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,360
Now, the key thing to understand

523
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,020
is that the activation
of those reward centers,

524
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,570
and the involvement of dopamine

525
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,400
puts us into an anticipatory state,

526
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,880
a state of waiting for
something to happen.

527
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,210
It also puts us into a state
of action or desiring action.

528
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,910
Our body and our mind

529
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,040
are what I like to refer to
as center of mass forward.

530
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,470
We are seeking how to resolve the craving,

531
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,603
even if we know that is impossible.

532
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,420
Why do I say that?

533
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,470
Well, we understand,

534
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,850
also on the basis of
brain imaging studies,

535
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,480
and also some studies in animals

536
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
that I'll describe in a moment,

537
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,890
that in order to understand grief,

538
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,810
we have to understand how attachments

539
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,350
are represented in our brain.

540
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,040
And it turns out that both attachments

541
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,870
and the breaking of
attachments in healthy ways

542
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,450
are governed by three important,
what we call dimensions.

543
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,580
A dimension is just some
feature of the world

544
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,850
that's represented in our brain.

545
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,670
So for instance, the color red
doesn't exist in your brain.

546
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,670
You happen to have cells,
neurons, in your eye

547
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,630
that respond best to long
wavelengths of light.

548
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,360
And those long wavelengths of light

549
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,950
happen to be what are reflected off things

550
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,310
that are perceived as red.

551
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,820
So in your mind, you have a notion of red.

552
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,270
I know this is a little bit abstract,

553
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,770
but you're not actually
lighting up red neurons

554
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,040
in your brain, and that's why you see red.

555
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,300
You are lighting up neurons in your brain

556
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,740
that represent the presence of red things

557
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,290
in your environment.

558
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,890
Similarly, we have neurons and maps,

559
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,790
or we say representations
of other dimensions.

560
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,930
We have dimensions of touch.

561
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,580
We have dimensions of sound.

562
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,290
And as I'll now teach you,

563
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,370
we have three dimensions
that define our relationship

564
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,830
to people and animals and things.

565
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,460
And when those people, animals and things

566
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,110
are within our immediate vicinity,

567
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,730
or if we know how we
could access them, right?

568
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,660
If somebody's still alive,

569
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,030
there's generally some way to access them,

570
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,120
unless they're refusing
to interact with us.

571
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,400
Well, when we understand that,

572
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,190
our motivational states can operate

573
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,400
in a way that's logical.

574
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,440
We know that, for instance,

575
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,220
if we want to find our
mother, brother, sister,

576
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,530
significant other, dog,
cat, parrot, et cetera,

577
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,370
we have to go through
a certain set of steps.

578
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,053
What are those three dimensions
and how do they work?

579
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,560
And that's what I'm
going to teach you now.

580
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,870
So at risk of sounding a
little bit too reductionist,

581
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,540
we are now going to
describe your relationship

582
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,370
to anything, everything, and anyone,

583
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,893
in these three dimensions.

584
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,430
How can we do that?

585
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,730
Why would we even want to do that?

586
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,410
Why would we want to rob the
complexity of relationships

587
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,400
of their contour and their detail?

588
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,140
Well, if we can understand the dimensions

589
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,460
in which we map our relationship

590
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,400
to people, animals, and things,

591
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,100
then we can understand why
it is that when those people,

592
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,100
animals, or things are
not accessible to us,

593
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,300
why it hurts so much,

594
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,530
and why it takes a certain amount of time

595
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,750
in order to re-understand, if you will,

596
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,930
or remap our association to them.

597
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,370
I promise that in grasping the information

598
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,070
I'm about to give you,

599
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,060
you will be able to better
orient in the grief process,

600
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,430
and you'll be able to move
through it more effectively.

601
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,600
The three dimensions
of relating to someone,

602
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,410
or an animal, or a thing,

603
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,240
are space, time, and closeness.

604
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
And in order to illustrate each one

605
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,810
and how they work together
to support relationships

606
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,160
and their involvement
in the grieving process,

607
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,730
I'm going to tell you about an experiment.

608
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,070
This experiment was actually done.

609
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,080
The experiment involves putting
people into a brain scanner

610
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,141
that allows the researcher to evaluate

611
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:47,540
brain activity in different areas.

612
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,050
In fact, can look in
a very non-biased way,

613
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,870
not make any predictions
about which brain areas

614
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,500
are going to be involved.

615
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,020
And the experiment is the following.

616
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,290
The person, we should
say the research subject,

617
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,380
first sees images of things that reside

618
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,010
at different distances from one another.

619
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,610
And when I say things, these are objects.

620
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,700
So in one case it's a
beach or a parking lot

621
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,010
with bowling balls set

622
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,010
at different distances from one another.

623
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,750
Their brain is imaged,

624
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,240
and as their brain is imaged,

625
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,350
they see different pictures
of different scenes,

626
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,380
the beach, the parking lot, et cetera,

627
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,690
bowling balls spaced in different ways,

628
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,140
close together, far apart,

629
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,180
regularly spaced, non-regularly spaced.

630
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,470
When one does this sort of experiment,

631
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,780
you see a lot of brain areas activated.

632
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,480
Not surprisingly, the visual cortex,

633
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,030
the area of the brain that is responsible

634
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,850
for creating visual perceptions,

635
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,060
but also a brain area
that seems uniquely tuned

636
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,360
to the distance between
you and the objects.

637
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,340
So whether or not the
bowling balls are far away

638
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,850
or close together from one another,

639
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,660
and whether or not they are far away

640
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,190
or close to you physically,

641
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,970
so literally the distance
between you and these objects.

642
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,880
We'll refer to that measure,

643
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,840
that dimension, as we call
it, as proximity, okay?

644
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,631
Whether or not it's very close to you,

645
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:09,610
high degree of proximity,

646
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,720
or far away, low proximity.

647
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,543
But it's simply physical space.

648
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,200
Then subjects listened to tones.

649
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,010
Those tones also are
spaced from one another.

650
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,160
So it could be something as simple as

651
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,340
my hand meeting the table top

652
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,750
that I'm happen to be sitting in front of.

653
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,750
So it's [hand hits].

654
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,819
They image the brain.

655
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,590
Of course, areas of the brain

656
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,620
that are associated with
auditory perception are active,

657
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,570
not surprisingly, but as they evaluate

658
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,000
different types of sounds
and patterns of sounds,

659
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,863
for instance, [hand hits]

660
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,920
they can start to parse brain areas

661
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,000
that seem uniquely tuned
to the spacing of sounds,

662
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,700
independent of what sounds are coming in.

663
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,920
So whether or not it's musical notes,

664
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,807
or my hand hitting the
table, or human speech,

665
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:05,490
they identified a brain
region that is uniquely tuned.

666
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,830
That is, it becomes active
specifically in response

667
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,840
to changes in the spacing between sounds,

668
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,420
much in the same way as they
could identify brain regions

669
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,030
that were only activated

670
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,930
when there were changes in
the distance between objects,

671
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,070
such as the bowling balls

672
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,300
that I used in the previous example.

673
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,860
And then the subjects saw
a different set of images.

674
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,660
The images that they saw
were of people, and of faces.

675
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,410
And some of the images that they saw

676
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,880
were of people's faces right up close,

677
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,540
and other images were
of people at a distance,

678
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,910
where you could see the
whole body of the person.

679
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,720
Now, they also varied

680
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,290
the emotional relationship
to those people.

681
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,870
That is, they were able to get photographs

682
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,130
from these research subjects' lives,

683
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,150
so they could show them
pictures of, for instance,

684
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,090
their sister or some random
person off the street.

685
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,520
They could show them pictures of a parent,

686
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,000
or of a neighbor,

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,890
or of a celebrity that's well known,

688
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,500
or of somebody that
they didn't know at all.

689
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,970
So they were able to vary

690
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,481
both the position of the
person, close or far,

691
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,400
and they were able to vary

692
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,840
the emotional distance to the person,

693
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,530
which is this dimension that
I'm referring to as closeness,

694
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,980
which is not physical closeness,

695
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,580
but how attached, or how
well you know somebody.

696
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,310
Now, this is maybe sounding like

697
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,670
a somewhat complicated experiment,

698
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,560
but the takeaway from this experiment

699
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,270
is exquisitely simple,
and exquisitely important.

700
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,873
The result was, that in
all three conditions,

701
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,840
changes in the physical
spacing of these objects,

702
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,400
changes in the temporal,

703
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,620
that is, the time spacing of these sounds,

704
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,480
and changes in the emotional distance

705
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,850
between the subject and different people,

706
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:56,070
the same brain area
was uniquely activated.

707
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,370
Now that is an incredible thing to find,

708
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,380
because what it suggests is that, yes,

709
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,410
of course there are brain areas

710
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,140
that are associated with
representation of visual objects,

711
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,690
and that yes, of course
there are brain areas

712
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,950
associated with representation
of different sounds.

713
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,170
And of course, there are brain
areas associated with faces.

714
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,330
We now know this.

715
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,570
In fact, there's something
called the fusiform face area,

716
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,110
which is uniquely tuned to faces.

717
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,130
But at the same time,

718
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,055
there is a unique brain
region that is activated

719
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,220
in all three of the
conditions I described,

720
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,110
that has to do with how
far you are from somebody,

721
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,140
both in space, in time,

722
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,610
and in terms of emotional closeness.

723
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,370
And that brain area, it turns out,

724
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:43,190
is a brain area called the
inferior parietal lobule,

725
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,550
the inferior parietal lobule.

726
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,950
Now, you don't need to know

727
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,550
where the inferior parietal lobule is.

728
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,700
In fact, you don't even need to know

729
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,510
the name of this brain area.

730
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,960
What you do need to know, however,

731
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,350
if you want to understand grief

732
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,010
and how to move through grief,

733
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,870
is that your map of people is not a map

734
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,850
of emotional closeness per se.

735
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,123
It is a map of emotional closeness,

736
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,200
what we call attachment,

737
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,690
that is interwoven, that is braided in,

738
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,070
in a very intimate way, with your map

739
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,150
of where they are in physical space,

740
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,320
and where they are in time,

741
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,410
when you saw them last,

742
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,250
when you're likely to see them again,

743
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,840
and if you were to want to see them,

744
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,980
how much time it would take to reach them,

745
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,840
or for them to reach you.

746
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,170
Now earlier, I said that
one of the key functions

747
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,280
of our nervous system

748
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,560
is to be able to make predictions.

749
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,980
And so it's somewhat obvious,

750
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,000
but nonetheless important
to state and restate

751
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,280
that one of the most powerful aspects

752
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,100
of our attachments to
people, animals, and things

753
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,860
is our ability to predict
what it would take

754
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,340
to see them again, and when we
are going to see them again.

755
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,940
In fact, we could say that our ability

756
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,560
to locate someone, or
an animal, or a thing

757
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,940
in space and time, right,

758
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,430
where they are and how
long it would take for us

759
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,060
to reach them or them to reach us,

760
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,170
is a prediction of the requirements

761
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,930
to engage in the attachment.

762
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,170
In order to illustrate this
at a little bit more depth,

763
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,800
let's just do a fill in
the blank experiment.

764
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,680
You can do this now in real time.

765
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,900
I want you to think of somebody
that you either rely on

766
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,750
or that you care about very, very much.

767
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,450
And I'll just allow you

768
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,433
to fill in the blank on this sentence.

769
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:33,923
"If I want to see blank,"
the person or animal,

770
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:38,930
"I could see them within
blank amount of time," right?

771
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,890
If right now you wanted to
see this person or animal,

772
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,650
or maybe even a thing,

773
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,440
how long would it take you to reach them?

774
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,930
Could be a day, could be a second,

775
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,120
could be they're right next to you.

776
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,070
All you'd have to do is turn your head.

777
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,563
Now answer this.

778
00:31:55,687 --> 00:32:00,687
"If this person were to travel
halfway around the world,

779
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,470
and land in their plane,

780
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,260
I would expect to hear from them

781
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,967
within blank minutes of them landing."

782
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,730
Okay, the answers of this
of course, will differ.

783
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,337
Now, I'd like you to answer this question.

784
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,240
"If I'd like to find myself,

785
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,410
it would take me X amount of time."

786
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,833
And of course, if you're listening to this

787
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:26,600
and you're understanding it
and you're of a rational mind,

788
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,840
the answer to that should be
zero seconds, instantaneous.

789
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,810
You are always able to locate
yourself in space and time,

790
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,650
provided you are in the
appropriate state of mind,

791
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,573
meaning not asleep, for instance.

792
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,160
That last question might
seem somewhat silly,

793
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,710
but it's a fundamentally important one,

794
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,240
because it illustrates the extremes

795
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,360
at which we map our
relationship to ourselves

796
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,810
relative to other people and things.

797
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,870
Now, if all of this sounds

798
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:55,460
like a bunch of neuropsycho babble,

799
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,630
parsing of the obvious,

800
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,600
I'd encourage you to suspend
that belief for the moment.

801
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,090
Because if you understand
that all relationships

802
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,670
are mapped in the brain and body

803
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,060
through these three dimensions,

804
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
space, time, and closeness,

805
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,360
or proximity of space, proximity in time,

806
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,040
and proximity of attachment,

807
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,040
how close or rich or
bonded you are to someone,

808
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,750
well, if you can understand that,

809
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,470
then it almost becomes obvious,

810
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,660
or at least it becomes intuitive,

811
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,040
as to why, after the loss of somebody,

812
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,310
in particular, a death,
or the loss of an animal,

813
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,830
this map has to be reordered.

814
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,830
Why, because if we are attached
to someone, or an animal,

815
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,640
at a deep level,

816
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,010
it is almost always on the basis

817
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,760
of a lot of what we call
episodic experience,

818
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,300
a lot of episodic memories,

819
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,330
memories of things that happen.

820
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,080
Episodic memories are literally

821
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,950
the conscious recollection of
your experience of somebody,

822
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,930
or an animal, or a thing.

823
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,530
And within that memory,

824
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,580
you have an understanding of
what has happened with them

825
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,050
in association to you,

826
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,570
what's going on with them,

827
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,860
where it happened, when it happened.

828
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,130
You have a rich knowledge database

829
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,120
that we call implicit knowledge, right?

830
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,760
You might not be aware of it all the time,

831
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,270
but it's within you, of
what this person is like

832
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,120
and what they're doing in their life.

833
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:26,022
When somebody is taken away
from us, for whatever reason,

834
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,920
episodic memories persist
for some period of time,

835
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,449
and they are still linked to
our feelings of attachment.

836
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:38,799
Grief is the process of
uncoupling, unbraiding,

837
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,989
and untangling that relationship

838
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,196
between where people
are in space, in time,

839
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,010
and our attachment to them.

840
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,510
What I mean by this is
when somebody or an animal

841
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,090
or a thing is taken from us,

842
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:55,010
either by decision or by
death, or by circumstance,

843
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,010
well, in that case, our entire memory bank

844
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,920
and our ability to predict
where and when they will be,

845
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,440
and therefore when we can feed
our attachment to them again,

846
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,760
that whole map is obliterated,

847
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,240
except that the attachment
itself has not been disrupted.

848
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,610
Assuming that you are
deeply attached to someone

849
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,610
or an animal or a thing,
that attachment persists,

850
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,300
and the grief process is one

851
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,990
in which you have to reorder
your understanding of them

852
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,300
in space and in time.

853
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,370
This is very, very hard to do,

854
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,590
and for some people it's
almost impossible to do,

855
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,610
at least at the outset of grief.

856
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,680
This, in a very neurosciencey way,

857
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,030
explains this stage that
Kubler-Ross described,

858
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,540
which many, again, not all,

859
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,770
but many people experience,

860
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,570
which is one of denial.

861
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,340
How could it be, why?

862
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,390
Well, when we have a rich catalog

863
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,400
of experiences with
somebody or of them, right,

864
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,870
ideas about them and what they do,

865
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,740
how they spend their day,

866
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,610
what they do and don't do,

867
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,300
where they do it, et cetera,

868
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,770
well, that memory bank
is not just flushed out

869
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,560
the moment that we learn that
they're no longer with us.

870
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,450
What happens is, the brain continues

871
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,730
to make these predictions

872
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,120
that they will be in a certain place

873
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,730
or a certain time, right,

874
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,960
that they'll be in a certain time zone

875
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,890
or they'll walk in the door any moment.

876
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,470
All of those predictions still hold.

877
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,030
The neural activity continues.

878
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,973
We call this reverberatory activity.

879
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,330
That explains the yearning for,

880
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,640
and the desire to interact,

881
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,140
and yet it's just beyond our reach.

882
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,230
Because once they're gone,

883
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,000
our brain still functions in a way,

884
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,380
these neural circuits
still function in a way

885
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,180
that put us into an action
state of seeking them,

886
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,460
looking for them in the same location,

887
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,070
expecting them to contact
us at whatever frequency

888
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,820
that we were used to hearing from them,

889
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,020
or that we could reach out to them

890
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,923
and reliably get a response.

891
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,840
It is immensely
disorienting, in other words,

892
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,933
to maintain a close attachment,

893
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,590
and at the same time to not
be able to make predictions

894
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,870
about where that person, animal,

895
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,010
or thing is in space and time.

896
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,030
Now, if this seems somewhat abstract,

897
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,890
I'm going to continue to flesh it out.

898
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,990
And actually right now,
I'd like to flesh it out

899
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,950
with a real-world
example of grief and loss

900
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,330
that comes to us from perhaps

901
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,810
one of the greatest
minds in human history,

902
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,390
and somebody who was intensely grounded

903
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,330
in reality and logic, and
indeed the physics of the world.

904
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,570
And the person I'm referring
to is none other than

905
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,210
the Nobel Prize-winning
physicist, Richard Feynman.

906
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,480
Many of you are probably
familiar with Richard Feynman.

907
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,940
Some of you perhaps are not.

908
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,780
Richard Feynman was a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist,

909
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,460
known for his thick New York accent.

910
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,140
He was actually not from
Brooklyn, as many people think.

911
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,010
He was actually from Far
Rockaway in Long Island.

912
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,090
Thick New York accent, very personable,

913
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,640
exceptional teacher, brilliant mind,

914
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,270
hence the Nobel Prize in physics.

915
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,680
Also a quite funny and amusing person,

916
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,593
told great anecdotes, et cetera.

917
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,770
Feynman had a childhood sweetheart

918
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,940
who turned out to be his first wife.

919
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,460
Her name was Arline, and it was well known

920
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,240
that Feynman was absolutely
in love with her.

921
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,870
He would talk about her all the time.

922
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,580
She had a profound influence
on him and his thinking,

923
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,700
and ultimately on his public
education efforts later.

924
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,237
If you haven't already read books such as

925
00:38:24,237 --> 00:38:26,240
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,"

926
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,570
or "What Do You Care
What Other People Think,"

927
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,403
I encourage you to do so.

928
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:30,277
And in fact, that quote,

929
00:38:30,277 --> 00:38:32,100
"What do you care what
other people think,"

930
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,400
is actually a quote, not of Feynman,

931
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,050
but of his first wife, Arline,

932
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,800
who sadly, died at a very
young age from tuberculosis.

933
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,095
Why am I sharing Feynman's story

934
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:44,180
of loss of his first bride?

935
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,010
Well, the reason is, Feynman continued

936
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,950
to write letters to Arline
for a long period of time.

937
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:54,693
This is well known only
because after Feynman died,

938
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:58,750
it was discovered that he kept an archive

939
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,880
of letters to his deceased first wife.

940
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,610
And even though he did eventually marry,

941
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,320
and in fact had many
relationships with many people,

942
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
and I think was married twice more,

943
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,330
maybe it was once, maybe it was twice,

944
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,370
the intensity of his grief,

945
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:19,110
but also his lack of ability
to transition his mind

946
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,600
to a place where he understood
that Arline had died,

947
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,150
is one of the more profound examples

948
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,670
of this inability to reconcile

949
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,240
the logical world and the emotional world.

950
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,290
And I'm now going to read to you a letter

951
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,910
that Feynman wrote to Arline.

952
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,890
This was discovered after Feynman's death,

953
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,980
when they went through his
desk and his belongings.

954
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,700
And as I read this, you're going to hear

955
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,950
some of the typical narrative of grief

956
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,920
that is not unique to
Feynman and his dead wife,

957
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,360
but there are also some elements in there

958
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,050
that I think you'll recognize

959
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,980
as highlighting this disbelief
and this dissociation

960
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,610
between the reality of somebody's location

961
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,050
in space and time,

962
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,700
and the emotional attachment
that they hold for us.

963
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,420
And therein lies the information

964
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,530
about how to better navigate grief.

965
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,860
So now I'm reading from the letter.

966
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,733
This was a letter dated
October 17th, 1946.

967
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,311
It's not terribly long, but bear with me.

968
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,970
"Dear Arline, I adore you, sweetheart.

969
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,610
I know how much you like to hear that,

970
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,060
but I don't only write
it because you like it.

971
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,450
I write it because it makes
me warm all over inside

972
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,220
to write it to you.

973
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,690
It is such a terribly long time

974
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,570
since I last wrote to
you, almost two years,

975
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,680
but I know you'll excuse me,

976
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,320
because you understand how I am,

977
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,840
stubborn and realistic,

978
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,053
and I thought there was
no sense to writing.

979
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,230
But now I know, my darling wife,

980
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,530
that it is the right thing to do,

981
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,900
what I have delayed in doing,

982
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,260
and that I have done so much in the past.

983
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,040
I wanted to tell you I love you.

984
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,310
I want to love you.

985
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,980
I will always love you."

986
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,760
So here we can hear the
intense emotional attachment

987
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,273
that clearly has persisted.

988
00:40:58,937 --> 00:41:00,930
"I find it hard to understand in my mind

989
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,520
what it means to love
you after you are dead,

990
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,940
but I still want to comfort
and take care of you.

991
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,720
And I want you to love me and care for me.

992
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,780
I want to have problems
to discuss with you.

993
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,860
I want to do little projects with you.

994
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,680
I never thought until just
now that we can do that.

995
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,380
What should we do?

996
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,390
We started to learn to
make clothes together,

997
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,550
or learn Chinese, or
getting a movie projector.

998
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,070
Can't I do something now?

999
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,320
No, I am alone without you,

1000
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,010
and you were the idea woman

1001
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,073
and the general instigator
of all our wild adventures.

1002
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,983
When you were sick,

1003
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:34,310
you worried because you could not give me

1004
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,133
something that you wanted,
and you thought I needed.

1005
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,430
You needn't have worried.

1006
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,520
Just as I told you then,

1007
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,440
there was no real need,

1008
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,830
because I loved you in
so many ways so much.

1009
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,270
And now it is clearly even more true.

1010
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,940
You can give me nothing now,

1011
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,960
yet I love you so that
you stand in the way

1012
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,780
of my loving anything else.

1013
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,310
But I wanted you to stand there.

1014
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,790
You, dead, are so much better
than anyone else alive."

1015
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,750
So you can really appreciate the depth

1016
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,320
and intensity of the attachment.

1017
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,653
Despite two years' time,
it clearly has not waned.

1018
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,230
I'll read the final paragraph now.

1019
00:42:09,347 --> 00:42:11,530
"I know you'll assure
me that I am foolish,

1020
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,580
and that you want me
to have full happiness,

1021
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,520
and don't want to be in my way.

1022
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,450
I bet you are surprised

1023
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,404
that I don't even have a girlfriend,

1024
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:20,670
except you sweetheart, after two years,

1025
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,650
but you can't help it, darling, nor can I.

1026
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,130
I don't understand it,
for I've met many girls,

1027
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,370
and very nice ones, and I
don't want to remain alone.

1028
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,963
But in two or three meetings,
they all seem ashes.

1029
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,910
You only are left to me.

1030
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,440
You are real.

1031
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,570
My darling wife, I do adore you.

1032
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,080
I love my wife.

1033
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,770
My wife is dead.

1034
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,300
Rich.

1035
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,010
P.S., please excuse my not mailing this,

1036
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,760
but I don't know your new address."

1037
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,130
So there's a lot contained in this letter.

1038
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,290
We could parse it line by line,

1039
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,840
but I think it's fair to say that clearly,

1040
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,090
there's an immense attachment
that's been maintained.

1041
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,920
So that's that dimension
of closeness of attachment.

1042
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,930
Clearly, there's an
understanding that she's dead.

1043
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,517
In fact, the last line
of this love letter is,

1044
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,670
"My wife is dead," right?

1045
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,168
He now moves her into the
third person, in fact,

1046
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:12,740
in that final line.

1047
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,240
So he understands this,

1048
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,870
and yet he maintains the attachment.

1049
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,330
And the very last portion
of the letter, the P.S.,

1050
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,750
the postscript, "I don't know
your new address," right?

1051
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,920
Somewhat humorous in the typical vein

1052
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,020
of a Feynman writing or speech.

1053
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,480
He always had a intensely amusing

1054
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,290
and playful sense of humor.

1055
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,080
And yet there's something
really contained in this.

1056
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,680
I don't think we're
reading into this too much,

1057
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,880
in that he doesn't know where to find her.

1058
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,640
He feels her as very real,

1059
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,750
and yet he doesn't know where to find her.

1060
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,480
He doesn't know her address.

1061
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,840
He obviously knows she's dead,

1062
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,920
so there's nowhere to mail it to.

1063
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,390
The reason I shared this letter with you,

1064
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,300
as opposed to one of the
almost infinite number

1065
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,329
of other letters that have been written

1066
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:02,870
by poets and authors and
scientists and everyday people,

1067
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,100
is that it really encapsulates
all three dimensions

1068
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,090
of attachment and grief.

1069
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,040
These notions of space,

1070
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,300
where is something or somebody,

1071
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,390
time, this dimension of,

1072
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,950
how long would it take me to reach them

1073
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,490
or for them to reach me?

1074
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,200
What would it take, in terms
of time, to be reunited?

1075
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,980
And then that last dimension of closeness,

1076
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,880
and the letter beautifully
illustrates the fact

1077
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,880
that, in grief, we maintain
that sense of closeness.

1078
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,470
And yet we have to uncouple it

1079
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,650
from these other two dimensions,

1080
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,780
as we're referring to, space and time.

1081
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,470
So with this current
understanding in mind,

1082
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,970
a few things start to become obvious

1083
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,250
and entirely normal to us,

1084
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,610
in the best and most healthy
sense of the word normal.

1085
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,190
For instance, if you've
lost somebody, or an animal,

1086
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,820
or even a thing that was
vitally important to you,

1087
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,210
it should make perfect sense to you

1088
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,160
as to why you keep
looking for that person.

1089
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,580
I recall this in my own life.

1090
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,540
I had the unfortunate circumstance

1091
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,330
of my graduate advisor,
who I was very close with,

1092
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,490
died quite young of breast cancer.

1093
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,660
And her daughter, she
actually has two daughters,

1094
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,400
kept her cellphone and
would occasionally call me.

1095
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,893
I had a quite close
relationship to their family.

1096
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,270
And when it would come in,

1097
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,050
the number would pop up on
my phone of not the daughter,

1098
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,820
but the name that showed up
was of my graduate advisor.

1099
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,330
So for years after she
died, my initial impulse,

1100
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,407
when the phone would ring was,

1101
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:36,740
"Oh my goodness, she's calling."

1102
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,860
It was a reflexive excitement

1103
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,960
because I truly always
enjoyed hearing from her.

1104
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,700
She was a wonderful,

1105
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,800
incredibly wonderful person, I should say.

1106
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,780
Similarly, when somebody passes away,

1107
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,600
we will find ourselves looking into a room

1108
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,200
expecting to see them there,

1109
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,520
or expecting them to knock
on the door any moment,

1110
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,383
or to call on Sunday morning, as it were.

1111
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,433
Those expectations, those predictions

1112
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:06,870
that the brain is making,
are entirely normal,

1113
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,580
because they are based
on that deep catalog

1114
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,680
of episodic memory that you
maintain about that person.

1115
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,760
Again, the depth and
richness of that catalog

1116
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,610
scaling, of course, in direct relation

1117
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,730
to how close you were
with that person, right?

1118
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,730
Closer to somebody means
more information about them.

1119
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,870
More information about them

1120
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,020
means your brain has a lot of implicit,

1121
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,973
unconscious notions of when
and where and how they show up.

1122
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,500
So the fact that your brain,

1123
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,250
and indeed, sometimes your body reacts

1124
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,840
to the expectation that they'll
be there is entirely normal.

1125
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,333
It's simply an activation of this map

1126
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,153
that involves closeness, space, and time.

1127
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,430
Not surprisingly, then,
the reordering of that map

1128
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,390
that's required in order to move through

1129
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,310
the grieving process,

1130
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:02,097
is going to involve some remapping.

1131
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:04,743
And you, as the person grieving,

1132
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,150
have the opportunity to ask
which node as it's called,

1133
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,120
which element or
dimension within that map,

1134
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,423
are you going to focus on?

1135
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,530
Some people really try
hard to disengage with

1136
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:21,600
and remap their sense of
emotional closeness to the person.

1137
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,490
That is, it's so unbelievably
overwhelming to them,

1138
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,630
that the person is no longer accessible,

1139
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,480
that they try and change their ideas

1140
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,320
about how close they really were.

1141
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,760
They try and change their
emotional attachment to the person

1142
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,060
after they've died.

1143
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,970
Clearly in the example that
I gave in the Feynman letter,

1144
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,828
that's not the case.

1145
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:41,860
The attachment seems indeed quite fixed

1146
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,033
and not going anywhere.

1147
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,520
Psychologists and
neuroscientists generally agree

1148
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,430
that the best way to
approach moving through grief

1149
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,740
is actually to remap these dimensions

1150
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,760
while maintaining the
close sense of attachment

1151
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,200
to the person,

1152
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,240
by not in any way trying to undermine

1153
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,780
the intensity of the attachment

1154
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,190
or how important it was to you.

1155
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,370
So we'll now talk about
how that process works,

1156
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:11,170
and the different entry
points, as they're called,

1157
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,260
to engaging in that process.

1158
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,370
So one straightforward way to think about

1159
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,770
this state of mind and
body that we call grief,

1160
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,010
is that the idea that someone,

1161
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,960
or an animal, or a thing,

1162
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,290
simply does not exist anymore

1163
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,920
is not something that the
brain can easily conceptualize.

1164
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,720
And the reason for that is that we,

1165
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,070
as beings that have a brain,

1166
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,810
and a brain, as an organ
that makes predictions,

1167
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:43,810
tends to rely more on
experience than knowledge.

1168
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,840
In other words, the
knowledge that someone,

1169
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,970
or an animal or a thing, is
gone, that it doesn't exist,

1170
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,428
at least not in the dimensionality

1171
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,920
that we were accustomed
to relating to them in,

1172
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,490
is something that we can
understand logically,

1173
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,520
but that emotionally is very hard to undo,

1174
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,870
and from a memory perspective
is very hard to undo.

1175
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,440
So it's not just that we are in a state

1176
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,490
of emotional disbelief.

1177
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,610
It's that we have neurons,
literally nerve cells

1178
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,770
and neural circuits,
connections between nerve cells,

1179
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,380
that are dedicated to this
vast, implicit knowledge

1180
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,680
of all the things we know

1181
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,010
about that person, animal, or thing.

1182
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:27,350
And just because they are no
longer in the dimensionality,

1183
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,010
meaning in the configuration,

1184
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,390
alive or present in our
life that they were before,

1185
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,270
doesn't eliminate those memories.

1186
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,500
Those memories persist.

1187
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,010
And so anytime we call to
mind the person's name,

1188
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,610
or we call to mind things
that remind us of them,

1189
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,843
or we suddenly feel the
desire to engage with them,

1190
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,790
the memories, those
episodic implicit memories,

1191
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,660
as they're called,

1192
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,690
all that menu and library of knowledge,

1193
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:00,050
slams us straight in the face,

1194
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:04,290
and pushes us into a mode
of wanting to act in a way

1195
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,030
that's consistent with
them still being here

1196
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,987
in the way that all that knowledge

1197
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:12,250
told us they were when we acquired it.

1198
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,410
That's a very long-winded way of saying

1199
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,094
that there's nothing wrong
about the emotional state

1200
00:50:17,094 --> 00:50:19,660
when we are in a state of grief,

1201
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,270
in fact, quite the opposite.

1202
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,580
But there is something
wrong about the memories,

1203
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,160
because the memories are based on

1204
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,060
our prior knowledge of them,

1205
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,950
and those memories actually do not apply

1206
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,270
to our current knowledge of them.

1207
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,050
And again, even though our
brain is a prediction machine

1208
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,540
and it's a very good
one, it's not perfect.

1209
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,240
In fact, it's far from perfect.

1210
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,480
So really, moving through grief

1211
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,837
is a process of understanding

1212
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:45,890
how relationships are mapped in the brain,

1213
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,230
space, time, and closeness,
also called attachment,

1214
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,650
understanding those three dimensions,

1215
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,840
understanding that they
are closely linked,

1216
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,430
and then understanding
that simply the knowledge

1217
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,290
that somebody or something or an animal

1218
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,390
isn't accessible to us,

1219
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,250
does not allow us to discard

1220
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,620
of all the knowledge that we have.

1221
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,730
And as a consequence,

1222
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,720
our brain is constantly
generating expectations

1223
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,810
of how to access them,

1224
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,740
even if we know that's
completely irrational.

1225
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,180
Now this should, I would hope,

1226
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,410
assist you in moving through grief.

1227
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,960
It's not a tool of the sort of,

1228
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,270
like a switch that you can flip

1229
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,880
and suddenly not feel grief,

1230
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,600
but it does point to a
specific set of mechanisms

1231
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,610
or a specific set of
steps that you can engage

1232
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,760
in order to start to move
through the grieving process

1233
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,500
in the most adaptive and effective way,

1234
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,333
and in a way that still holds in mind,

1235
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:41,370
your close attachment to the person.

1236
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,680
So let's talk about some of the tools

1237
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,810
for adaptively moving through grief.

1238
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,160
These are tools gleaned from
the research psychology,

1239
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,320
the clinical psychology, and
the neuroscience literature.

1240
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,420
So I've synthesized my understanding

1241
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,173
of those three literatures,

1242
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,100
to provide the tools that
I'm about to describe.

1243
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,620
The first one involves the acknowledgement

1244
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,940
and really the understanding

1245
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,800
that you don't want to
disengage or dismantle

1246
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,010
your real attachment to
someone, an animal, or a thing.

1247
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,010
That's a real thing,

1248
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,030
and there is actually no adaptive reason

1249
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,550
to try and persuade
yourself or numb yourself,

1250
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,810
or somehow avoid the thinking

1251
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,560
of just how much they meant to you.

1252
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,770
What is important, however,

1253
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,160
is that you make some
effort to shift your mindset

1254
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,810
and your understanding of that person,

1255
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:31,740
in a way that holds in
mind that yes, indeed,

1256
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,910
the attachment is very real,

1257
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,640
and in some cases is very, very intense,

1258
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,360
but is now going to be uncoupled

1259
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,640
from the other two dimensions of the map,

1260
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,520
namely space and time.

1261
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,430
So again, just to make absolutely clear,

1262
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,940
there's no reason to try
and convince yourself

1263
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,980
that you weren't actually
that close to this person

1264
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,983
or them to you.

1265
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,340
There's no reason to try
and reduce the intensity

1266
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,173
of that attachment.

1267
00:52:58,173 --> 00:53:00,450
To the contrary, you
want to anchor yourself

1268
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,000
to that attachment, but
you want to make sure

1269
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,840
that your thoughts about the person,

1270
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,550
and your feelings about the person,

1271
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,870
are not oriented toward or in
reference to, I should say,

1272
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:15,940
that map, that deep catalog
of memories that you had.

1273
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,640
Now, this is not simply
a fancy way of saying,

1274
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,030
don't live in the past.

1275
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,620
This is saying, you need to maintain

1276
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,340
your sense of attachment,

1277
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:28,100
but you need to start making
predictions and understanding

1278
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,170
about how you're going to
engage with that attachment,

1279
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,700
how you're going to feel those things,

1280
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,180
without the expectation

1281
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,500
that things that once happened before

1282
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,150
are going to happen again.

1283
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,980
So it's a complicated
process, you can imagine,

1284
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,750
but you really want to hold and
register two things at once.

1285
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,470
It's sort of like spinning
two plates at once,

1286
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,570
and therefore it's going
to feel like effort.

1287
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,350
One way to do this is to set aside

1288
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,061
a dedicated period of time,

1289
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:58,061
of maybe five or 10, maybe
even as much as 30 minutes,

1290
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,460
or depending on your
capacity, 30 to 45 minutes,

1291
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,040
in which you are going to feel deeply

1292
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,270
into your closeness and your attachment

1293
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,600
to that person, animal, or thing.

1294
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,860
But you are consciously going to try

1295
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,276
and prevent yourself from thinking about

1296
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:16,690
a couple of categories of things.

1297
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:20,830
First of all, you want to
actively try and disengage

1298
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,670
from any attempt to engage in

1299
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,500
what's called counterfactual
thinking, the what ifs.

1300
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,840
What if I had called them a day earlier?

1301
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,870
What if they had taken
a different route home?

1302
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,020
What if I had taken a
different route home?

1303
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,570
These counterfactual modes of thinking

1304
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,220
are an infinite landscape of possibility,

1305
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,870
and they are very closely tied to guilt.

1306
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,200
Guilt is an interesting emotion.

1307
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,693
We should probably do an
entire episode about guilt,

1308
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:52,315
but guilt as defined by
psychologists and neuroscientists

1309
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:55,700
is actually a way of assigning
ourselves more agency,

1310
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,810
more capability of controlling
reality than actually exists.

1311
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,360
And it's a very slippery slope.

1312
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,590
And I want to be clear.

1313
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,170
It's not the case that guilt

1314
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,210
is never an appropriate response,

1315
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,630
but in the context of grieving,

1316
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,040
guilt is very precarious,

1317
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,480
because in thinking "I
could have done this,"

1318
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,367
or "if I had only done that,"

1319
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:20,610
you are essentially exploring
an infinite landscape

1320
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,310
of things that you can never refute.

1321
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,420
You will never know that
had you not gone down

1322
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,450
a different path or they had not taken

1323
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,090
a particular path in life,

1324
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,700
that things would've turned out different,

1325
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,090
but you can't know that it
would've worked as well,

1326
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,720
meaning you actually don't know

1327
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,730
that your what ifs are true,

1328
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,030
and you don't know that they're not true.

1329
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,980
And so as an infinite space,
it's a very precarious one,

1330
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,050
and it will not allow you to uncouple

1331
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,260
that intense emotional
attachment that I'm telling you

1332
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,150
is actually vital to hold onto,

1333
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,000
from that catalog of episodic memory

1334
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,890
that you've established.

1335
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,920
In fact, it's going to
strengthen those bonds.

1336
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,750
So in this dedicated five or 10 or 30,

1337
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,790
whatever period of time you can
tolerate and maintain focus,

1338
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:07,043
the idea is to think about
your attachment in a rich way,

1339
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,160
and to perhaps even experience
that in your brain and body.

1340
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,850
I think if you're in a stage of grief,

1341
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:16,170
that actually will be
fairly reflexive to do,

1342
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,511
but to try as much as possible

1343
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:20,550
to hold that grief in the present

1344
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,960
and to be connected to your
immediate physical environment.

1345
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,563
So you want to orient yourself
in current space and time,

1346
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,370
rather than focus on memories,

1347
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,880
or what you would've liked to see happen,

1348
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,630
or the wish that they were still there,

1349
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,790
while at the same time,

1350
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:39,410
thinking about the depth and
richness of that attachment.

1351
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:43,190
This is a obviously a
tightrope walk, so to speak.

1352
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,750
It's an emotionally challenging,

1353
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,480
and sometimes even will be experienced

1354
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,570
as a physically challenging
tool or experience,

1355
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:54,310
but in our understanding of
how attachments and grief

1356
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,790
are represented in the brain,

1357
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,430
this can be an immensely
beneficial practice,

1358
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,210
because it is the first step,

1359
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:03,370
and indeed, it represents
many of the steps

1360
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,480
in the voyage from the
initial shock of loss,

1361
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,400
to our ability to hold in mind somebody

1362
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,740
or an animal or a thing in
a way that still allows us

1363
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,860
to feel the depth and fullness
of connection to them,

1364
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,280
without feeling the yearning,

1365
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,440
that reaching for the glass of water

1366
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,130
that unfortunately will never be resolved.

1367
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:25,090
Keep in mind that as you
embark on this process,

1368
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,370
it is entirely normal
for your mind to flip

1369
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:30,240
into various states of expectation

1370
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,270
that they're suddenly going to be there.

1371
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,480
In fact, because of the closeness

1372
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,350
of these three dimensions in the map,

1373
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,990
space, time, and attachment,

1374
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,260
it's entirely normal that
when you start to think about

1375
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,360
your attachment to somebody,

1376
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,630
or an animal, or a thing,

1377
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,870
that you almost start to experience them

1378
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,990
as present in that environment.

1379
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,080
I'll share with you a somewhat bizarre,

1380
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,070
or it sounds bizarre
to articulate out loud,

1381
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,960
but many of you perhaps
will resonate with this.

1382
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,890
For years after my graduate advisor died,

1383
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,110
I would get an experience of someone

1384
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,370
touching the back of my neck
when I would think about her.

1385
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:06,650
And that was not an experience
I ever had with her, right?

1386
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,930
It was a professional relationship.

1387
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,300
I don't ever recall her touching me

1388
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,278
on the back of my neck,

1389
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,777
or me touching the back of
my neck in her presence,

1390
00:58:12,777 --> 00:58:15,760
at least not on any regular basis.

1391
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,800
So it was very perplexing to me.

1392
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,150
And then I encountered this
incredible literature on grief,

1393
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,400
which said the following.

1394
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:26,870
"Grief in many ways is
like a phantom limb."

1395
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,860
For those of you that aren't familiar,

1396
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,411
many people who experience
amputation of a limb,

1397
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:35,160
either through surgery
or accident or otherwise,

1398
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,930
will feel in a very genuine way

1399
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,290
that the limb is still present,

1400
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,130
even though when they look
for the limb, it's not there.

1401
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,680
So they can feel pain in limbs.

1402
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,160
They can feel the sensation of touch.

1403
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,140
There's some famous experiments
from the neurologists

1404
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,440
and my former colleague

1405
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,003
at University of California, San Diego,

1406
00:58:50,003 --> 00:58:52,420
who goes by his last name, Ramachandran.

1407
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,650
Some people just call him Rama.

1408
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,410
He's an incredible scientist,

1409
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,184
and has done a lot of
really important work,

1410
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:00,350
in particular on phantom limb,

1411
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,770
among other things,

1412
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,135
and has done some beautiful experiments

1413
00:59:03,135 --> 00:59:07,120
showing that people who
have phantom limb pain

1414
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,020
or that are experiencing
different sensations

1415
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:10,853
in their phantom limb,

1416
00:59:10,853 --> 00:59:11,820
that can be very intrusive,

1417
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,690
much in the same way

1418
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,210
that expecting someone
to walk through the door,

1419
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,830
who you happen to know is deceased,

1420
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,490
can be very intrusive.

1421
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,730
Ramachandran's done beautiful experiments,

1422
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,200
showing that if you give people

1423
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,410
what's called a mirror box,

1424
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:29,290
this is a box in which
you insert an intact limb,

1425
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,190
and there are some mirrors

1426
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:31,612
that give you the visual impression

1427
00:59:31,612 --> 00:59:33,720
that the other limb is still present,

1428
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,280
and you move the intact limb

1429
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,760
and you get a mirror
image of the non-existent,

1430
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,390
but nonetheless a visual image

1431
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,320
of the phantom limb moving,

1432
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,910
that you can resolve some of the pain

1433
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,020
of a limb that feels otherwise cramped up.

1434
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,100
In other words, the visual perception

1435
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,413
can reverse some of
these phantom sensations.

1436
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,430
In many ways, the phantom limb scenario,

1437
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,920
and what I described about a sensation

1438
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,420
of being touched on the back of the neck,

1439
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,840
or this feeling that we have

1440
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,200
when we engage in the thinking

1441
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,500
and the emotions of our
attachment to someone,

1442
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,530
an animal, or a thing is very
much like a phantom limb,

1443
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,070
only it exists in the emotional space,

1444
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,083
and it exists because it is reactivation

1445
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:18,060
of these maps about
space, time, and person.

1446
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,450
And so if the process
of moving through grief,

1447
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,530
adaptively in a healthy way,

1448
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,240
involves maintaining the attachment,

1449
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,600
but uncoupling that attachment

1450
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,520
from the space and time
representation of that person,

1451
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,030
animal, or thing that we had before,

1452
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,810
well, then the question becomes,

1453
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:37,040
where should we place our
expectation of them, right?

1454
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,813
Now, that of course will
vary from person to person.

1455
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:42,370
Some people with particular
religious beliefs

1456
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:45,803
will indeed believe that
the soul of the person,

1457
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,060
the molecules of the person

1458
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,050
have been reordered and exist in some sort

1459
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:52,100
of either distributed domain, right?

1460
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,200
That they are in everything,

1461
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,140
or they are in one location.

1462
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,360
I'm not here to speak to
that one way or the other.

1463
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,930
There's no good experiment I know

1464
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,170
either to prove or disprove that,

1465
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,810
nor would I want to.

1466
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,683
It's not the job of science, frankly.

1467
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,540
However, allowing
ourselves to place notions

1468
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,120
of where that person, animal, or thing is

1469
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,690
in their current new configuration,

1470
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:19,970
whatever that might be,

1471
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,510
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

1472
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,410
or that the person's soul
comes out of their body.

1473
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,260
These are all the different
variations that people hear.

1474
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,390
Or some people think,
"Well, it's just molecules

1475
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,860
and they disintegrate and are reordered,

1476
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,284
and come up as the plants and the trees."

1477
01:01:30,284 --> 01:01:34,310
Again, a near infinite
number of possibilities,

1478
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,733
and it depends a lot on personal belief.

1479
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,929
It is, however, essential

1480
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,360
that no matter what you believe,

1481
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,560
that you have some firm representation

1482
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,020
of where that person, animal, or thing is

1483
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,070
so that you can plug it into this map,

1484
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:56,070
this three-dimensional map of
space, time, and attachment.

1485
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:57,590
The process of moving through grief

1486
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,950
can't simply be that we
hold onto the attachment

1487
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,800
and we discard with any understanding

1488
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,430
of where they are in space and time.

1489
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,790
And actually, the letter
that Feynman wrote

1490
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,513
to his deceased wife Arline,

1491
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,230
again, so beautifully

1492
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,110
and really poignantly illustrates the fact

1493
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:15,260
that he doesn't really
know where to find her.

1494
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,910
On the one hand, he really
understands that she's gone.

1495
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,743
And on the other hand,

1496
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:21,680
he understands that he
still very much expects her

1497
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,960
to be there, that he would
like to mail the letter.

1498
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,560
But then of course, in this final,

1499
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,523
somewhat humorous line,

1500
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,310
he doesn't know where to
send the letter, he tells us.

1501
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,600
What's very clear, and
I think is very healthy,

1502
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,860
is the fact that the
emotional bond is still there,

1503
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,270
that that is maintained.

1504
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:43,120
And so this tool, if you will,

1505
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,300
of dedicated blocks of time

1506
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,210
for really spending some effort,

1507
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,330
and it is indeed effort

1508
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,920
to access the emotional connection

1509
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,040
while starting to uncouple the other nodes

1510
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,420
of the map, as it were,
is something that is hard.

1511
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,440
You should expect it to be hard,

1512
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,710
but in terms of the options one has

1513
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,590
in order to deal with grief,

1514
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:06,160
it is indeed the most
adaptive way to go about it.

1515
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,540
You're not trying to
avoid thinking about it.

1516
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,250
You're not engaging in this
counterfactual thinking,

1517
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,190
the what if, what if, what if.

1518
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,560
You're not drowning it out with substances

1519
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,560
or delusion or with other
ways of distracting yourself.

1520
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,260
So in that sense, it is truly adaptive.

1521
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,750
Now, of course, I don't want to imply

1522
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,680
that I'm a clinical psychologist.

1523
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,900
I'm certainly not.

1524
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,330
There is absolutely a place

1525
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,060
for working with a trained professional

1526
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:31,960
to move through grief,

1527
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,270
especially these situations,

1528
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,515
these one in 10 people

1529
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:39,420
who deal with what's
called complicated grief,

1530
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:40,880
or very prolonged grief.

1531
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,930
Those are somewhat different things,

1532
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,490
but in general, point to the fact

1533
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,470
that there are people who have

1534
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,930
an exceptionally hard
time moving through grief.

1535
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:48,850
We'll talk about who those people are

1536
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,050
and ways to move through them,

1537
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,980
with or without a
professional to assist you.

1538
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,760
But nonetheless, we're
starting to understand

1539
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,420
on the basis of neuroscience,

1540
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,620
what some of the more adaptive

1541
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,880
and functional ways of
moving through grief are.

1542
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,510
In order to really understand how a tool

1543
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,430
of the sort that we're describing to work,

1544
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:12,803
and what it's designed to
accomplish at a mechanistic level,

1545
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,483
I'd like to teach you

1546
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,730
about a very important
aspect of your brain function

1547
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,960
that has everything to do with grief

1548
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,070
and the process of moving through grief,

1549
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:23,650
but has a lot to do

1550
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,920
with other aspects of our
life experience as well.

1551
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,070
Some of you are probably familiar

1552
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,090
with a brain area called the hippocampus.

1553
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,300
The hippocampus is a
structure that's involved

1554
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,870
in the formation of new memories,

1555
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,103
but not the maintenance of memories.

1556
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,940
I discussed the hippocampus in detail

1557
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,320
in our episode on memory,

1558
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,600
and our episode with our guest,

1559
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,670
Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,

1560
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,323
an expert on learning and memory.

1561
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,190
During those two discussions,
I did not however,

1562
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,720
touch into what the
different cell types are

1563
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,650
in the hippocampus, and the
different roles they perform.

1564
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,450
And it turns out that there are indeed

1565
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,930
different cell types in the hippocampus,

1566
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,640
and they perform very different roles

1567
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,773
that are absolutely central
to the grief process.

1568
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,760
We have cells in our hippocampus,

1569
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,590
meaning you have cells
in your hippocampus.

1570
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,423
These cells are neurons,

1571
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:14,680
nerve cells that fire any time,

1572
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,450
or, and when we say fire,
I should just remind you,

1573
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,930
I mean, have electrical activity,

1574
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:25,590
any time that we enter a
particular familiar location.

1575
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,330
So for instance, think about your bedroom,

1576
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,000
and think about where the bed is.

1577
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,970
As you're doing that,

1578
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,600
these so-called place cells are firing,

1579
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,470
not necessarily to represent

1580
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,170
that it's a bed at that location,

1581
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:40,193
but to represent the location itself.

1582
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,610
We also have neurons in our hippocampus

1583
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,680
and elsewhere in our brain, I should say,

1584
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,380
that represent proximity.

1585
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,650
So for instance, if you were to wake up

1586
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:50,483
in the middle of the night

1587
01:05:50,483 --> 01:05:51,760
and walk into the kitchen,

1588
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,390
and it's somewhat dark,

1589
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,880
and you orient toward the sink

1590
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,260
to get yourself a glass of water,

1591
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,399
or to the refrigerator to get yourself

1592
01:05:58,399 --> 01:06:00,943
something to drink or to eat,

1593
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,113
as you get close to the
sink or the refrigerator,

1594
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,670
there are neurons in your hippocampus

1595
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:10,750
that are going to start
engaging electrical activity,

1596
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,090
because you are in the
mirror expected proximity

1597
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:15,210
of the sink or refrigerator,

1598
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:18,950
and you know where they are,
hence the word expected.

1599
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,430
Now that all seems fine and good.

1600
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,020
You've got neurons that
represent where things are,

1601
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,970
and it sort of goes without saying

1602
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:29,520
that those same neurons map
to our emotional attachments.

1603
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,840
We generally know where
to find our loved ones.

1604
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,520
Even if they don't live with us,

1605
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,780
we generally know what city they're in.

1606
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,700
Even if they're traveling,

1607
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,110
we generally have a sense
of where they're traveling

1608
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,900
or the general area in
which they're traveling.

1609
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,470
Place cells and proximity cells

1610
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:44,970
are involved in that kind of mapping

1611
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,960
and representations as well.

1612
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,160
Now there's a third kind of cell

1613
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,970
that's particularly important
for the sort of tool

1614
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,410
that we were talking about earlier,

1615
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,500
that tool of holding on

1616
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,560
to the emotional attachment to somebody,

1617
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,400
and yet trying to deliberately
remap our understanding

1618
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,020
of where they are in space and time.

1619
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,660
And that has to do with
a category of cells

1620
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,650
called trace cells.

1621
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,450
Trace cells were discovered
by a number of laboratories.

1622
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:13,030
I think the most renowned of
those is the Moser Laboratory.

1623
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,830
The Mosers are a couple.

1624
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:15,950
Actually, they were a couple.

1625
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,940
They're now, I think, amicably
separated or divorced.

1626
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,420
That's not what this episode's about.

1627
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,203
If I have that wrong, forgive me.

1628
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:26,288
Edvard and Britt are their names.

1629
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:28,410
Their relationship isn't what's important,

1630
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,043
except what is important

1631
01:07:30,043 --> 01:07:33,330
is the work that they did
together in one form or another,

1632
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,180
which was very important work,

1633
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,130
establishing this category of cells

1634
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,700
not just in the hippocampus,

1635
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,700
but in an area of the brain
called the entorhinal cortex,

1636
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,090
that acts as a sort of coordinate system,

1637
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,933
to orient us in space and time.

1638
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:50,860
Trace cells are activated
when we expect something

1639
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,733
to be at a given location,
but it's not there.

1640
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,700
Experiments done in their laboratory

1641
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,470
and in other laboratories
have shown that, for instance,

1642
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:04,830
if you give a rodent or frankly, a person,

1643
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,223
a object that always resides
at the same location,

1644
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:12,700
and we reach to it in order to access it,

1645
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,363
let's say where your
coffeemaker is in the morning.

1646
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,430
I do a pour-over coffee.

1647
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,240
If I'm drinking coffee or
latte, I'll do a pour-over.

1648
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,970
It's always more or less
in the same location.

1649
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:26,920
And so there are place
cells and proximity cells

1650
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,158
that relate to my being able to find

1651
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,313
that pour-over coffee cone thing.

1652
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,770
However, if I were to go to that location

1653
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:38,560
and it wasn't there, the trace cells,

1654
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,290
these neurons in my hippocampus

1655
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:42,399
and in the entorhinal
cortex and elsewhere,

1656
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,589
'cause again, these cells are connected

1657
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:45,740
by way of circuitry,
by way of connections,

1658
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,180
those trace cells would fire.

1659
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,930
We could even call it a trace circuit.

1660
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:52,580
It's a circuit that has an expectation

1661
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,920
that something will be in a location.

1662
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,609
But when something is
not at that location,

1663
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:58,319
this circuit becomes active.

1664
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,259
This is important because
what we're talking about here

1665
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,910
is a neural circuit and a set of neurons

1666
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:05,250
that are responsible, not for
the presence of something,

1667
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,373
but the absence of something.

1668
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,109
We have every reason to believe,

1669
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:11,509
based on neuroimaging studies

1670
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,330
and studies in animal models,

1671
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:16,969
that trace cells become very
active in the immediate stage

1672
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:19,383
after the loss of a loved one,

1673
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:25,669
that the brain and our
maps of the person, place,

1674
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,220
or thing that we know cognitively,

1675
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,850
we understand, we even
believe they are gone.

1676
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,939
They are not accessible
for whatever reason,

1677
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:35,569
death or otherwise.

1678
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:37,962
And yet we have neurons that are firing,

1679
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,430
to reveal that absence to us.

1680
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:45,100
And these neurons are closely associated

1681
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,930
with neurons that tell us
where things ought to be.

1682
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:51,380
So if you feel the expectation,

1683
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,109
or you sense that somebody

1684
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:54,510
should walk through the door any moment,

1685
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:55,780
or call at any moment,

1686
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,620
or be next to you when you wake up,

1687
01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:00,900
and yet you cognitively
understand that they won't,

1688
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,540
that there's no real
reason why they should,

1689
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,180
because they are indeed
gone, you are not crazy.

1690
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,050
In fact, it's simply a reflection

1691
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,540
of the normal functioning
of these trace cells

1692
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,770
and trace circuits.

1693
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:16,050
Now I'd like to consider why two people,

1694
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,710
both who are intensely attached

1695
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:22,990
to a person that is no longer there,

1696
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,330
can experience the grief
of the loss of that person

1697
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,920
in such different ways.

1698
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,260
This is often observed.

1699
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,470
You can have, God forbid,

1700
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,520
incredibly sadly, in cases
where a child is lost,

1701
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,760
where both parents are grieving intensely,

1702
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,400
but one seems to feel it at
a emotional depth and level

1703
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,050
that seems distinct from the other.

1704
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:48,040
Now of course, keep in mind
that we never really know

1705
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,530
how other people are feeling.

1706
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:51,050
This is something actually that was raised

1707
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:54,710
in the episode where I
interviewed a psychiatrist

1708
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,920
and researcher colleague of mine

1709
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,513
from Stanford, Karl Deisseroth.

1710
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,963
As a psychiatrist, I heard him say once

1711
01:11:01,963 --> 01:11:04,820
that we really don't know
how other people feel.

1712
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,610
In fact, a lot of times
we don't even really know

1713
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,300
how we feel, or at least describing that

1714
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,863
is quite challenging with language, often.

1715
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:13,020
And indeed that is the case.

1716
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,350
We don't really know
how other people feel.

1717
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,450
There's no clear way of knowing

1718
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,910
that the expression someone else has

1719
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,420
or whether or not they're crying or not,

1720
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,710
or their body language really represents

1721
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,760
how they feel inside.

1722
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,130
So that is important to keep in mind.

1723
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:29,560
Nonetheless, there does seem to be

1724
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,740
a sort of a split among people,

1725
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,460
and indeed, among animals as well,

1726
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,090
even within a species,

1727
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:39,370
in terms of how intensely they feel

1728
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,660
the yearning aspect of grief.

1729
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,840
And it appears, based on a number

1730
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,140
of different lines of evidence,

1731
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,960
that that relates to this molecule

1732
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,750
that some of you have probably
heard of, which is oxytocin.

1733
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:54,210
Oxytocin is a hormone slash peptide.

1734
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,290
A peptide just means a protein,

1735
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,150
generally a small protein,

1736
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:00,590
and a hormone is generally something

1737
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,850
that functions at numerous
locations in the body

1738
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:05,750
to impact numerous organs
and areas of the brain.

1739
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,490
So a peptide can be a hormone,

1740
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:08,710
and a hormone can be a peptide.

1741
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:10,240
They are not mutually exclusive.

1742
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,740
Oxytocin has a variety of
roles in the brain and body.

1743
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,600
It's involved in milk
letdown during lactation.

1744
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,800
It's involved in pair bonding,
both in males and females.

1745
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,310
It's involved in bonding
of parent to child,

1746
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:27,310
and indeed, between romantic
partners, et cetera, et cetera.

1747
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,130
Let's talk about some of the animal models

1748
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:31,900
that inform us about the
potential roles of oxytocin

1749
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,193
in the grieving process.

1750
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:37,200
There's a species of animal
called the prairie vole,

1751
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,040
and believe it or not,

1752
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,990
the prairie vole has been
studied fairly extensively

1753
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:44,140
by neuroscience and
psychology researchers.

1754
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,830
In fact, our former director

1755
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:49,220
of the National Institutes
of Mental Health, Tom Insel,

1756
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:52,770
his laboratory focused quite
heavily on prairie voles.

1757
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,610
Prairie voles are one species of animal,

1758
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,810
but depending on where they live,

1759
01:12:56,810 --> 01:12:59,890
you find that some prairie
voles are monogamous.

1760
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,890
That is, they mate with the
same prairie vole for life.

1761
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,130
They raise litters of little
prairie voles for life,

1762
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,712
and other prairie voles,

1763
01:13:10,712 --> 01:13:14,440
generally that live in
different locations in the wild,

1764
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,763
are non-monogamous,
sometimes called polygamous.

1765
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,020
The neurochemical and circuit basis

1766
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:25,963
for this monogamy versus
non-monogamy, quite interesting.

1767
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,790
However, in the context
of grief and attachment,

1768
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,810
the prairie voles have taught us a lot,

1769
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:32,670
and they've taught us a lot

1770
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,560
through the following experiment.

1771
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,090
You take two prairie
voles that are coupled up.

1772
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:39,560
So these would be
monogamous prairie voles,

1773
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,903
that have established a couple bond.

1774
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:45,680
I guess you would call
that at a prairie voledom.

1775
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,170
Anyway, you put them in a cage together.

1776
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:50,820
They mate together, they
raise young together,

1777
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:53,033
and then you separate them.

1778
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,480
You literally put a physical barrier

1779
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,850
between the two of them,

1780
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:01,850
and you can evaluate how strongly
one prairie vole will work

1781
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,930
to get access to the
other prairie vole, right?

1782
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,903
This is sort of the "Romeo and Juliet"

1783
01:14:06,903 --> 01:14:09,343
of prairie vole experiments.

1784
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,850
And what you observe is that
the monogamous prairie voles

1785
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:16,420
will work very hard to
get back to their mate,

1786
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,550
to get access to their mate.

1787
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:18,810
They will lever press.

1788
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:21,620
They'll even walk across a metal plate

1789
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,760
that they get a electrical shock.

1790
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,450
They'll work very, very hard.

1791
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:28,103
They will cross rivers
and valleys, if you will,

1792
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:31,023
in the experimental context, that is.

1793
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:36,120
The polygamous prairie voles,

1794
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,320
and again, we don't know
if they are polyamorous.

1795
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,030
We don't know what they feel, right?

1796
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:41,040
We don't know if they're in love

1797
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,900
or if they're motivated
simply for other things.

1798
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,600
But the non-monogamous prairie
voles will not work as hard

1799
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,570
to access a prairie vole partner.

1800
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,960
Now you could argue
that's because they expect

1801
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,490
that there will be other
prairie vole partners,

1802
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,770
but even if they've never experienced

1803
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:59,180
another prairie vole partner,

1804
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:02,060
they won't work quite as hard to get back

1805
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,790
in connection with this
other prairie vole,

1806
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,770
to mate or otherwise.

1807
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,630
This turns out to be interesting,

1808
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,920
when you start to explore the patterns

1809
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,710
of so-called oxytocin
receptors in the brain.

1810
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,950
To make a long story short,

1811
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,193
and to also bridge to
the human literature,

1812
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:23,110
it turns out that the
monogamous prairie voles

1813
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:26,560
have far more oxytocin
receptors in this brain area

1814
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,220
that I mentioned earlier,
the nucleus accumbens.

1815
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,320
And again, to remind you,
the nucleus accumbens

1816
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,880
is the brain area
associated with motivation,

1817
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,670
craving and pursuit.

1818
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:39,020
So it's as if the monogamous prairie voles

1819
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:44,020
have a capacity to link
the attachment circuitry

1820
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,750
and the molecules of attachment,

1821
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,470
in this case, oxytocin,

1822
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:51,820
to reward pathways and
to motivational pathways.

1823
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,020
Polygamous, or we should say,

1824
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,913
non-monogamous prairie voles, do as well.

1825
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,740
However, they have less
oxytocin receptors.

1826
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,290
So in other words,
non-monogamous prairie voles

1827
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:06,620
seem to have less yearning
for attachment overall,

1828
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,600
at least to a single
individual prairie vole.

1829
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,740
And when we look at the human literature,

1830
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,390
in terms of oxytocin receptor expression

1831
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:16,740
and brain imaging experiments, and so on,

1832
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,320
what you find is the same,

1833
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,970
that people that experience intense grief,

1834
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:24,110
and a deep yearning and a motivation

1835
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:27,130
to reconnect with the person, animal,

1836
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,750
or thing that is lost,

1837
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,470
in many cases have heightened levels

1838
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,810
of oxytocin specifically,

1839
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,780
or I should say, oxytocin
receptors to be exact,

1840
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,670
specifically within the brain regions

1841
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:41,520
associated with craving and pursuit.

1842
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,140
So for those of you that find yourself

1843
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,690
in this kind of stuck mode,

1844
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,970
this persistence of trying

1845
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:51,420
to reach into the past
or wishful thinking,

1846
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,817
this counterfactual thinking,

1847
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:55,717
"if only, if only, if only."

1848
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,210
You don't necessarily want
to pathologize that thinking.

1849
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:01,090
First of all, we should acknowledge

1850
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,790
that it's not necessarily adaptive.

1851
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:05,020
And in fact, in the
complete loss of somebody,

1852
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,470
or if somebody says
they don't want anything

1853
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:07,901
to do with you ever again,

1854
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:10,700
by all means, you know, if
that's expressed clearly,

1855
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,610
then you need to accept that reality.

1856
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:17,130
But the yearning, the
desire, and the impulsivity,

1857
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:21,670
that kind of leaning in
at a almost reflexive way,

1858
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,240
to try and access that person again,

1859
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,940
to text them, to want to
hear from them, could,

1860
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,400
and I have to highlight,
could reflect the fact

1861
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,430
that you just so happen to
have more oxytocin receptors

1862
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:35,270
or maybe more oxytocin
overall in this brain area

1863
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,360
that's associated with
motivation and pursuit.

1864
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,760
It does not necessarily mean

1865
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,680
that you are more capable of attachment

1866
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,900
than people who move
through grief more quickly.

1867
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,870
And I should say that
people move through grief

1868
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:48,703
at different rates.

1869
01:17:48,703 --> 01:17:52,320
Even if two people lost the
same person, or same animal,

1870
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,800
people move through
this at different rates.

1871
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,880
And some of that is no
doubt psychological,

1872
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,070
but some of it, no doubt,

1873
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:01,660
is also neurochemical and biological.

1874
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:02,870
And in sharing this with you,

1875
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:05,090
I hope it sheds some understanding

1876
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,570
and perhaps even some
compassion for people

1877
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:10,320
who are moving through things more quickly

1878
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,030
or in a different way.

1879
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:15,110
And of course it should
also, I would hope,

1880
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,280
shed compassion and understanding

1881
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,400
for people that seem incapable
of quote unquote moving on.

1882
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,100
It's taking them far longer to move on.

1883
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,360
Earlier, we talked
about complicated grief,

1884
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,370
non-complicated grief, and
prolonged grief disorder.

1885
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:31,650
And I should say that
the precise divisions

1886
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:36,210
between these categories
is not very precise.

1887
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,960
It takes a really trained expert

1888
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,500
to be able to identify whether or not

1889
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,660
somebody is in the prolonged
grief disorder category,

1890
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,100
complicated or non-complicated grief.

1891
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,880
There's actually a set of questionnaires

1892
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,660
that I invite you to answer if you like.

1893
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,610
They were provided, or I
should say I accessed them

1894
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:56,700
through a public site on
Mary-Frances O'Connor's webpage.

1895
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:58,510
We'll put them in the show note captions.

1896
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:00,930
You actually can submit those
answers in an anonymous way

1897
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:02,780
to a study that she's doing.

1898
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,610
She has several surveys,

1899
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,370
one for loss of a romantic relationship,

1900
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:11,220
other for loss due to death of somebody,

1901
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,810
and still another one that
relates to homesickness,

1902
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:15,960
and it's also available in
several different languages.

1903
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,240
So I'll provide a link to that website.

1904
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,210
It's very easy to download.

1905
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:20,690
There's no cost to that at all.

1906
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:21,978
You can contribute to the scientific

1907
01:19:21,978 --> 01:19:24,140
data collection process, if you like.

1908
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,760
And I do believe that
you get your scores back

1909
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:30,083
or an interpretation of your
scores by participating there.

1910
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:34,350
When Mary-Frances O'Connor
hopefully comes on the podcast,

1911
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:36,000
she can tell us some more of the detail

1912
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,900
about separating out this
prolonged grief disorder,

1913
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,770
complicated and non-complicated grief.

1914
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:44,190
But in the meantime, it's very clear

1915
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:46,380
that people move through
grief at different rates.

1916
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,230
And as I mentioned just a moment ago,

1917
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,690
that this is entirely normal,

1918
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,780
probably has a basis in neurochemicals

1919
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,930
and hormones, such as oxytocin.

1920
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,210
There are probably other reasons as well.

1921
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,760
In fact, we can assume
with almost certainty

1922
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,170
that there are other reasons as well.

1923
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:03,380
Nonetheless, I think
it is really important

1924
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:06,730
to think about why some people
might have a harder time

1925
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,870
moving through grief due
to life circumstance,

1926
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,703
innate differences, and so on.

1927
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,310
There's a very nice set of studies,

1928
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,720
but one in particular,

1929
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,600
entitled "Catecholamine Predictors

1930
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,960
of Complicated Grief Outcomes."

1931
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,830
Here again, the first author
is Mary-Frances O'Connor,

1932
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:24,850
reminding us that she's done

1933
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,650
so much important work in this area.

1934
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,960
This paper has several conclusions,

1935
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,990
but one of the key conclusions

1936
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:33,820
is that this particular
category of molecules

1937
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:34,960
we call the catecholamines,

1938
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,350
the catecholamines include epinephrine,

1939
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,480
which is also adrenaline,

1940
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,350
norepinephrine, which is noradrenaline,

1941
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,123
and dopamine, which you've
learned about before.

1942
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,250
Here, I'm just going to paraphrase,

1943
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,220
or I'll read directly, actually.

1944
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,420
What they found was that "participants",

1945
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,757
again, this is human subjects,

1946
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:53,890
"with the highest levels of epinephrine,

1947
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,390
of adrenaline, pre-treatment,

1948
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,270
had the highest levels

1949
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,040
of complicated grief
symptoms post-treatment,

1950
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:00,940
and that could account

1951
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,440
for their baseline level of symptoms."

1952
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,100
What this means is that people

1953
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,870
that have a lot of circulating adrenaline,

1954
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:06,993
we might even call these people,

1955
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:10,240
people who are, or typically reside

1956
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,200
at a higher level of
autonomic arousal, right?

1957
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,460
We have an autonomic nervous system

1958
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,640
that dictates how calm
or alert or stressed

1959
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,260
we happen to be just at baseline.

1960
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,300
People who tend to be more
alert and anxious at baseline,

1961
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,148
prior to any grief episode,

1962
01:21:24,148 --> 01:21:27,650
tend to have, or statistically on average,

1963
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,720
we should say, are more
likely to experience

1964
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,030
complicated grief and maybe
even prolonged grief symptoms.

1965
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:38,730
So if you're somebody that is
anticipating losing someone,

1966
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,350
or an animal, or a thing at some point,

1967
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,880
and I think that really means everybody,

1968
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,960
utilizing tools to
adjust your epinephrine,

1969
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,950
your adrenaline levels down

1970
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,460
has a number of important benefits,

1971
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:52,040
improving sleep, health
metrics, et cetera.

1972
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,180
There are tools to do that.

1973
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,150
We have an episode on mastering stress

1974
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:57,827
that you can find at our
website, hubermanlab.com.

1975
01:21:57,827 --> 01:22:01,160
It has a lot of behavioral tools
that are backed by science,

1976
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,920
some of work that was
done in my laboratory,

1977
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,610
but certainly other laboratories as well,

1978
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,500
that will allow you to control

1979
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,710
your autonomic nervous
system, both in real time,

1980
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:13,357
and reduce the overall level of stress

1981
01:22:13,357 --> 01:22:15,610
and even chronic activation

1982
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:17,220
of the so-called sympathetic arm

1983
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,280
of the autonomic nervous system,

1984
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,490
which is just fancy geek speak for saying,

1985
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,540
there are tools to help you be calm,

1986
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,830
not just for sake of
navigating daily stress,

1987
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:27,390
but as this paper illustrates,

1988
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:30,120
for anticipating the
fact that at some point,

1989
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,870
you will lose somebody,
an animal, or a thing,

1990
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:35,950
and there is a way to
move through that process

1991
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,850
that we call healthy, normal grieving.

1992
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,850
And then there's the
so-called complicated grief,

1993
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,890
or prolonged grief disorders,

1994
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:44,410
that reflect immense challenge

1995
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:47,400
in moving through grief
at a reasonable rate.

1996
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,040
So you can somewhat inoculate yourself

1997
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,280
against complicated or prolonged grief,

1998
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,160
by reducing your resting levels of,

1999
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:00,400
or your pre-loss levels of
epinephrine, of adrenaline.

2000
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,330
And again, there are
excellent tools to do that.

2001
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:03,880
I won't review them here for sake of time,

2002
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,140
but they're time-stamped,

2003
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,830
and you can access those easily.

2004
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:09,063
Again, zero cost tools.

2005
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,927
Going back to this paper,

2006
01:23:11,927 --> 01:23:13,620
"Catecholamine Predictors of Complicated

2007
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,800
Grief Treatment Outcomes,"

2008
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,520
should say that not only did participants

2009
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,900
with the highest levels of adrenaline

2010
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:20,733
have the highest levels

2011
01:23:20,733 --> 01:23:23,390
of complicated grief
symptoms post-treatment,

2012
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:27,310
but the predictive relationship
between these two things,

2013
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:28,970
adrenaline and complicated grief,

2014
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,560
was not seen in depression.

2015
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,390
And I find that incredibly interesting,

2016
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:35,570
because it further separates
depression from grieving

2017
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:36,970
and grieving from depression.

2018
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,140
It's a resounding theme again and again.

2019
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,360
Grieving is not depression,

2020
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,470
and depression is not
necessarily grieving.

2021
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:45,559
They can coexist, but they
are separable as well,

2022
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:50,220
and indeed, reflect separate
brain circuitries entirely.

2023
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,367
So the conclusion they draw is that

2024
01:23:51,367 --> 01:23:53,220
"The present study supports the hypothesis

2025
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,300
that catecholamine levels,"

2026
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,500
again, epinephrine,
dopamine, norepinephrine

2027
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,537
are the catecholamines,

2028
01:23:57,537 --> 01:23:59,720
"are affected by bereavement and in turn,

2029
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,090
can affect the ability of
those with complicated grief

2030
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:03,890
to benefit from psychotherapy."

2031
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:04,723
So what does all this mean?

2032
01:24:04,723 --> 01:24:08,020
What this means is, we
can prepare ourselves

2033
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:11,660
to be in a better state to access, yes,

2034
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,060
access grief when it's appropriate.

2035
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,090
And indeed, grief is the
appropriate response,

2036
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,490
when we lose someone,
an animal, or a thing

2037
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:21,200
that we are closely attached to,

2038
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,999
and yet, to be able to move through that

2039
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:28,999
at a pace and in a way that
is most adaptive for us.

2040
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,650
And to just, again, highlight
what adaptive means.

2041
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,400
It does not mean dissociating
from the attachment

2042
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,003
to the person, animal, or thing.

2043
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,490
I just want to pause for a second,

2044
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:43,490
and mention why I keep repeating
person, animal, or thing.

2045
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,330
I'm saying that because,

2046
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,533
while grieving the loss of a person,

2047
01:24:49,448 --> 01:24:51,240
or a relationship with a person,

2048
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,050
doesn't have to be
through death, of course,

2049
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:55,940
but death or otherwise
is something that we all

2050
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:57,320
can intuitively understand,

2051
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,750
even if we haven't experienced it.

2052
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:03,080
We are capable of
achieving great attachments

2053
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,900
to animals as well.

2054
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,873
And while the loss of
a thing, of an object,

2055
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,520
in no way, shape or form,

2056
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,940
approximates the loss of
a person or an animal,

2057
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,464
I would never suggest that it does,

2058
01:25:14,464 --> 01:25:18,210
it would also be naive and
unfair of me or anyone else

2059
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,077
to suggest that things can't
hold immense importance to us,

2060
01:25:21,077 --> 01:25:24,290
and that the loss of them
can feel quite significant,

2061
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,650
and invoke the grieving process.

2062
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,510
This isn't always about materialism.

2063
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:31,410
Sometimes it's purely about
the sentimental attachment.

2064
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:34,050
So for instance, the
loss of a wedding ring

2065
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:36,830
or an engagement ring that
was very meaningful to you,

2066
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:39,800
or an article of clothing or a painting,

2067
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,310
or even a small, seemingly
unimportant object

2068
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,143
to somebody else,

2069
01:25:44,143 --> 01:25:45,300
but something that held
great meaning to you,

2070
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,460
maybe a seashell that you collected

2071
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,750
with somebody on the beach,

2072
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:51,020
and then somehow it gets lost.

2073
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,831
And it's the relationship with that person

2074
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:56,020
that's contained within
that object for you,

2075
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:59,600
as a representation within
that object that's important.

2076
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,207
That's the reason why I keep saying,

2077
01:26:01,207 --> 01:26:03,070
person, animal, or thing.

2078
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:06,110
I think it's only fair to
include things in that category,

2079
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:07,610
but of course, with the understanding

2080
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:11,260
that they don't hold the
absolute same magnitude

2081
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:13,160
as the loss of a being.

2082
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,170
One thing that we ought
to consider for a moment,

2083
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,370
is whether or not the depth of attachment

2084
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:19,260
that you have to somebody

2085
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,810
predicts how long it will take

2086
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:23,526
for you to move through
the loss of that person.

2087
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:25,370
We often hear this.

2088
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:27,550
Actually, I can remember some years ago,

2089
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,287
at the end of a relationship,

2090
01:26:29,287 --> 01:26:31,877
a friend and colleague of mine saying,

2091
01:26:31,877 --> 01:26:34,860
"You know, for every year
that you were together,

2092
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:38,100
it's going to take you one
month to get over that person."

2093
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,970
And I thought, "Where in the world

2094
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:41,807
did those data come from?" [laughs]

2095
01:26:41,807 --> 01:26:45,200
And this is what I call
anecdata or collective data,

2096
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,987
where this is like phrases such as,

2097
01:26:47,987 --> 01:26:50,150
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

2098
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:51,400
And indeed, sometimes absence

2099
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,080
can make the heart grow fonder,

2100
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,300
in the context of two living people

2101
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,210
or people in a loving relationship,

2102
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,590
or even in the context of grief and loss.

2103
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:00,707
But of course, there's,

2104
01:27:00,707 --> 01:27:02,380
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,"

2105
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,537
and then you also will hear,

2106
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:05,270
"Out of sight, out of mind."

2107
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,160
And if you've been
listening to this episode,

2108
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,800
clearly, out of sight
does not mean out of mind

2109
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,620
or out of emotional connection.

2110
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,690
So these sayings of, "Well,
it takes X number of months

2111
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,590
for number of years,"

2112
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:18,780
or "out of sight, out of mind,"

2113
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,118
or "absence makes the heart grow fonder,"

2114
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:22,680
they really don't hold a lot of meaning,

2115
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,890
at least not for somebody like me,

2116
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:28,480
who likes science because
science is at least geared

2117
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,700
toward or aims towards establishing things

2118
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,370
in fact, not opinion,

2119
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:35,910
but also because science
allows you to make predictions.

2120
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,610
It allows you to orient
yourself in a process,

2121
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:41,200
and make predictions and understand.

2122
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,600
So, what are we to think of people

2123
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,050
who seem very, very attached to somebody?

2124
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,010
They break up, and they seem
just crushed, devastated.

2125
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:50,860
But three weeks later,

2126
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,070
they're in a new relationship

2127
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,490
and they seem perfectly fine.

2128
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:57,030
Or somebody whose spouse dies,

2129
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:59,350
and then suddenly they're
in a new relationship.

2130
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:02,270
I think there are rates of
transition, if you will,

2131
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:06,490
that suggest some dysfunction,
pathology, et cetera.

2132
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,630
But here we aren't in a position to judge.

2133
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:11,360
We're only in a position
to speculate about this.

2134
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,990
And I think we can reasonably speculate

2135
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:16,310
that it sort of makes sense

2136
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:20,260
why someone who has an
intense attachment to somebody

2137
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,543
might be able to form

2138
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:24,170
intense attachments generally, right,

2139
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:25,500
that they aren't restricted to one person,

2140
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,450
whereas other people who have

2141
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,530
an intense attachment to somebody

2142
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:31,270
might find themselves entirely
incapable of moving on,

2143
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,210
or it would take them a very long time,

2144
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:37,400
hence the lines in the Feynman
letter to Arline about,

2145
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,010
he had met various other young women.

2146
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:41,010
They seemed perfectly nice.

2147
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:43,097
And yet, they were meaningless to him

2148
01:28:43,097 --> 01:28:46,440
in the shadow of her memory,

2149
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,640
or we should say, in the
light of Arline's memory,

2150
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,500
or the memory of Arline, rather.

2151
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,011
So these dimensionalities of attachment,

2152
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:56,450
they cut in every direction.

2153
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:59,420
And I don't think any
well-trained psychologist

2154
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,137
or neuroscientist would ever say,

2155
01:29:01,137 --> 01:29:03,341
"Oh, if you are somebody
who becomes very attached,

2156
01:29:03,341 --> 01:29:05,640
therefore it's very hard to move on."

2157
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,570
I think that could be true.

2158
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:07,790
It could also be that if you're somebody

2159
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:09,360
who has a great capacity for attachment,

2160
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,360
you have a great capacity
for attachment overall.

2161
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,286
Neuroscience nor psychology
is really in a position

2162
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:17,120
to judge, certainly,

2163
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,570
but it's also not in a position

2164
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:19,750
to make those kinds of predictions,

2165
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:22,502
at least the field, as
it stands right now,

2166
01:29:22,502 --> 01:29:25,190
of attachment and grieving,

2167
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:27,370
can't really speak to why that's the case.

2168
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:30,030
So that's my attempt to depathologize

2169
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:31,490
some of what we observe,

2170
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:33,026
although I have to confess,

2171
01:29:33,026 --> 01:29:36,400
from a just sort of everyday stance,

2172
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,930
that sometimes the rate in which

2173
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:40,336
people move out of
attachments and grieving

2174
01:29:40,336 --> 01:29:42,160
can be somewhat eerie.

2175
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,970
I'd like to take a moment
and explore this idea

2176
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,410
that allowing ourselves to really feel

2177
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:49,010
the attachment to somebody

2178
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:51,160
can accelerate or at least support

2179
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,593
adaptive transitioning through grief.

2180
01:29:55,176 --> 01:29:58,990
There's a really wonderful
study that, on the face of it,

2181
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:01,860
appears to be a, what
we call negative result.

2182
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,740
A negative result is when
a hypothesis is posed,

2183
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:07,660
and then turns out the
hypothesis is not true.

2184
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:09,490
But as is the case with so many

2185
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:11,090
interesting scientific findings,

2186
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:13,950
often when there's a negative result,

2187
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,280
there's a more interesting result

2188
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,260
nested in that negative outcome.

2189
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,620
And this is the case in a particular paper

2190
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,453
I'll share with you now.

2191
01:30:20,453 --> 01:30:21,286
This is a paper published

2192
01:30:21,286 --> 01:30:23,360
in the journal "Biological Psychology."

2193
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,117
And again, the title is posed
as a question, which is,

2194
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:29,700
"Emotional Disclosure for Whom?

2195
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,520
A Study of Vagal Tone in Bereavement."

2196
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,700
What this study explored

2197
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,900
was whether or not written disclosure

2198
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,870
of the emotional connection
to somebody that was lost

2199
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:42,550
would be effective as a way for people

2200
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:45,383
to move through the grieving process.

2201
01:30:46,254 --> 01:30:49,330
The study also explored
the so-called vagus nerve.

2202
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:51,860
The vagus nerve is an
extensive nerve pathway

2203
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:54,030
that is bidirectional
between brain and body,

2204
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:56,530
so brain to body and body to brain.

2205
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:59,536
It generally is associated
with calming effects

2206
01:30:59,536 --> 01:31:00,910
on our brain and body,

2207
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:03,870
although that's certainly
not always the case.

2208
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:05,350
The way to think about it in terms of

2209
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:07,420
what we're going to talk about now

2210
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,480
is heart rate and heart rate variability.

2211
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,453
And in very simplistic terms,

2212
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,700
if your heart was just allowed to beat

2213
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,990
at its sort of default rate,

2214
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:20,360
that rate would be rather high,

2215
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,330
because of the activation of
the so-called sympathetic arm

2216
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:24,510
of the autonomic nervous system,

2217
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:28,593
the alertness component of
the autonomic nervous system.

2218
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,750
The parasympathetic nervous system,

2219
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,760
as it's called, involves calming.

2220
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,100
We sometimes hear
sympathetic is for stress

2221
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:37,450
or fight or flight.

2222
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,300
It's for a lot of other things
as well, I should mention,

2223
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,830
and it is not for sympathy.

2224
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,110
Sympa simply means together,

2225
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:43,970
and it reflects the activity
of a bunch of neurons

2226
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:47,270
being active at the same
time or together, sympa,

2227
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,840
whereas parasympathetic
is often associated

2228
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,210
with quote unquote rest
and digest functions,

2229
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,250
or calming functions,

2230
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:55,540
although it is certainly
involved in other things as well.

2231
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,430
So sympathetic nervous
system drives alertness,

2232
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,810
panic, stress, et cetera.

2233
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:02,070
Parasympathetic nervous system,

2234
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:04,950
meaning a distinct set
of neurons drive calming,

2235
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:07,062
falling asleep, digestion,

2236
01:32:07,062 --> 01:32:10,920
sexual arousal for that matter, and so on.

2237
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,340
So it's sort of like a seesaw

2238
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,200
of alertness and calm, alertness and calm,

2239
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,750
sympathetic and
parasympathetic, back and forth.

2240
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,170
The vagus nerve is generally associated

2241
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,120
with parasympathetic functions,

2242
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,990
and has the capacity to
slow down our heart rate,

2243
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,520
in particular, by exhales,

2244
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,790
and just simply because of
the movement of the diaphragm

2245
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:31,000
and its relationship to the heart

2246
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,450
and the thoracic cavity.

2247
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:36,373
Exhales result in slowing
down of the heart rate.

2248
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:41,160
This is what we call an
increased vagal tone.

2249
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,130
So let me explain for a moment.

2250
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:44,400
And actually here's a tool you can use,

2251
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,240
not just in terms of navigating grief,

2252
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,720
but in terms of stress
modulation, generally.

2253
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:50,570
We have a muscle called the diaphragm.

2254
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:52,610
When we inhale, [inhales]

2255
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,580
whether or not it's through
our mouth or our nose,

2256
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:56,423
our diaphragm moves down.

2257
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,750
As a consequence, there
is more space overall

2258
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,060
in the thoracic cavity.

2259
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,680
The heart gets a little bit bigger,

2260
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:05,094
believe it or not, volume-wise,

2261
01:33:05,094 --> 01:33:08,650
blood flows more slowly
through that large volume.

2262
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:10,620
And there's a signal conveyed

2263
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,460
from the nervous system to the
heart to speed the heart up.

2264
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,380
So inhales literally speed your heart up.

2265
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:19,560
And when you exhale,
the diaphragm moves up.

2266
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,730
And as a consequence,

2267
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:22,490
there's less space in the thoracic cavity.

2268
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:24,384
Heart gets a little bit smaller.

2269
01:33:24,384 --> 01:33:26,780
The existing blood volume
in the heart at that time

2270
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,960
moves more quickly through
that small volume, right?

2271
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,180
Given amount of blood volume,

2272
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:32,730
make the compartment it's
in, the heart, smaller,

2273
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:34,980
and the blood moves more
quickly through that volume.

2274
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,630
And as a consequence, the nervous system

2275
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,210
sends a signal to the heart,

2276
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:41,010
via the vagus and other pathways,

2277
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,380
to slow the heart down.

2278
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,550
In other words, exhales
slow the heart down.

2279
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:45,539
That process, that relationship

2280
01:33:45,539 --> 01:33:48,030
between inhales speeding the heart up,

2281
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,900
and exhales slowing the heart down,

2282
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,660
is something called
respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

2283
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:56,710
Some people are able to engage
respiratory sinus arrhythmia

2284
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:59,080
more naturally, more
reflexively than others.

2285
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,550
You can actually train this

2286
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,860
by consciously thinking
about slowing your heart rate

2287
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,070
while you exhale,

2288
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:06,930
and consciously thinking about
increasing your heart rate

2289
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:07,763
as you inhale.

2290
01:34:07,763 --> 01:34:10,270
You can literally
strengthen these pathways.

2291
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:13,170
Now, respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

2292
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:16,670
and the ability to slow your
heart rate with exhales,

2293
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:19,640
is one dimension of
what's called vagal tone,

2294
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,460
or your ability to control

2295
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:25,250
your overall level of activation
of alertness and stress,

2296
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,810
with these vagus nerve pathways.

2297
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:29,060
So vagal tone is something

2298
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,460
that varies from person to person.

2299
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,250
If you've trained up
or you've thought about

2300
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,150
your relationship between
breath and heart rate,

2301
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:36,320
you can improve vagal tone.

2302
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,079
Some people have very robust vagal tone

2303
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:40,720
without having done any training.

2304
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,653
Other people have less of it, et cetera.

2305
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,040
I'll just paraphrase from this paper,

2306
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,450
and you'll see where this takes us

2307
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:50,517
in terms of navigating grief,
because it's quite important.

2308
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:51,650
"The vagus nerve provides

2309
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:53,870
inhibitory regulatory
influence on the heart,

2310
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:55,950
allowing the heart rate
to increase rapidly

2311
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:56,900
through vagal withdrawal,"

2312
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,120
that means kind of coming off the break

2313
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,917
of the parasympathetic nervous system,

2314
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:03,650
"as in response to a stressor
in one's environment."

2315
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:04,920
Right, when you're stressed,

2316
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,650
you rarely take the opportunity,

2317
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:09,850
if it's an immediate stress
or threat, to actively exhale,

2318
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:11,130
although that would be
a great tool to use.

2319
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:12,270
And in fact, we promote that tool

2320
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,970
in our "Mastering Stress" episode.

2321
01:35:14,837 --> 01:35:16,150
"Vagal withdrawal usually co-occurs

2322
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:18,230
with an increase in sympathetic
activation of the heart."

2323
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:19,677
You now know what that is,

2324
01:35:19,677 --> 01:35:21,390
"or is known as the
fight or flight response.

2325
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:24,830
Vagal tone reflects the degree
to which there is tonic,"

2326
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:28,490
meaning ongoing, "vagal
influence on the heart."

2327
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:32,040
So when you have a high
degree of vagal tone,

2328
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:36,630
it means that you are
always activating that break

2329
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:38,820
on your stress system, just at default.

2330
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,250
And some people just
happen to do that more.

2331
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,660
Other people need to practice
long exhale breathing

2332
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:45,030
in order to build up vagal tone,

2333
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,960
something that's very useful to do,

2334
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,870
whether you're grieving or not.

2335
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:50,250
Now in this study, what they did

2336
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,460
is they had people,

2337
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,513
and I should say it was 35 participants,

2338
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,450
go through a writing exercise
for a period of weeks.

2339
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:00,870
They actually wrote about
three times per week.

2340
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:02,930
Then there was a follow
up at some period of time,

2341
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:04,430
and then again, about a month later.

2342
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:06,800
And there were two different groups.

2343
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,850
One group was in the so-called
written disclosure group.

2344
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:12,300
What they did is they, on day one,

2345
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:16,180
they would write about what
happened when a loved one died.

2346
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:19,490
And indeed they used people
who had experienced real loss.

2347
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:21,690
And so they were asked to talk about

2348
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,230
and write about their deepest emotions

2349
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:26,870
and thoughts about it,
memories of their loved one,

2350
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:28,660
very intense stuff, if you think about it,

2351
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:31,600
if they're in the immediate
period of having lost someone.

2352
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,780
Then they actually were
asked to write a letter

2353
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,180
to the person that they lost.

2354
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:39,050
So again, a very intense
exercise to go through,

2355
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:42,170
if you did indeed lose
somebody as these subjects had.

2356
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:43,620
And then of course there was the testing,

2357
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,023
some period of time later,

2358
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,380
and I'll tell you what that period,

2359
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:48,730
what that testing involved.

2360
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,680
The other group was a
so-called control group,

2361
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,220
where they were simply told to write

2362
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:54,510
about how they use their time.

2363
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:56,950
So an emotionally kind of
empty writing exercise,

2364
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:57,783
if you will.

2365
01:36:57,783 --> 01:36:59,790
They described what they did
today after they woke up,

2366
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:03,430
et cetera, no heavy
emotional content, and so on.

2367
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:05,890
Now, as I mentioned earlier,

2368
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:09,680
the immediate results of this
study were a negative result,

2369
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,700
meaning no effect.

2370
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,240
The disclosure that, we should say,

2371
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,010
the emotionally intense writing group

2372
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:16,990
and the control group did
not differ at baseline

2373
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:18,260
on any symptom measures

2374
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,300
or psychological variables, they tell us,

2375
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:24,750
and at least at face value,
somewhat disappointingly,

2376
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:28,410
there really wasn't any kind
of difference in outcome

2377
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:30,147
between the group that wrote about

2378
01:37:30,147 --> 01:37:31,930
the very emotionally intense stuff

2379
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,670
versus non-emotionally intense.

2380
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:35,830
Now, what I didn't tell you thus far

2381
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:38,500
is why they had them do
this exercise at all.

2382
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,750
They had them do this exercise

2383
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:41,760
because many of the effective practices

2384
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,940
for moving through grief
involve, as I mentioned earlier,

2385
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:49,860
getting close to and actually
deliberately experiencing

2386
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,680
the attachment that one has
to that person that was lost,

2387
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,490
not distracting one's self,

2388
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,900
not getting into this
counterfactual thinking,

2389
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,170
the what if, what if, what if,

2390
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:59,930
but rather thinking about,

2391
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:02,530
or in this case, writing
about the real attachment.

2392
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:04,820
And so the initial idea was,

2393
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:06,480
if people write about this attachment,

2394
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,817
that they're going to
experience this attachment,

2395
01:38:07,817 --> 01:38:11,050
and that will serve them
in some or many ways,

2396
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:12,980
in terms of moving through grief.

2397
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,090
And that wasn't what they found.

2398
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:15,930
They found no difference
between the two groups,

2399
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:20,880
until they explored who
had higher vagal tone,

2400
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,160
who had a greater degree

2401
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,520
of so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

2402
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,240
In other words, who was able
to modulate their state,

2403
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,210
using their breathing and their body.

2404
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:34,830
And what they discovered was
that a subset of individuals

2405
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,460
who had a high degree of vagal tone

2406
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:41,620
seemed to get more benefit from
this writing-type exercise.

2407
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:42,960
Now, this is one study,

2408
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,930
and I would consider it fairly
preliminary with 35 subjects.

2409
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,980
Although, you know,
it's a study unto itself

2410
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,430
and I think a quite nice one,

2411
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,330
and it really set the stage

2412
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:54,170
for a number of other
studies that followed,

2413
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:55,820
from this group and other groups,

2414
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,640
that really point to the
fact that yes, indeed,

2415
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,087
accessing these states of emotionality

2416
01:39:01,087 --> 01:39:03,140
by writing or thinking about somebody

2417
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,460
is quite powerful in terms
of engaging the bodily states

2418
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,347
and the mind states associated
with the attachment.

2419
01:39:09,347 --> 01:39:13,020
And that is very beneficial
for moving through grief.

2420
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:15,683
That is very beneficial
for sensing the attachment.

2421
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:19,410
And now it makes perfect
sense as to why some people

2422
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,960
would benefit from that sort
of practice more than others,

2423
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,802
because some people are able to access

2424
01:39:23,802 --> 01:39:27,730
more real somatic feelings of attachment

2425
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:29,130
by writing about the attachment,

2426
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,090
or by thinking about it, than others.

2427
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,260
So this brings us back
to an earlier discussion

2428
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:35,266
we were having, where
we were talking about

2429
01:39:35,266 --> 01:39:37,930
how some people seem to move
through things very quickly,

2430
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:40,090
or don't seem to be grieving constantly,

2431
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:43,187
and a spouse or a family member
of that person might think,

2432
01:39:43,187 --> 01:39:44,630
"Gosh, why aren't you upset?

2433
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,870
How is it that you can be
functional and I'm not,"

2434
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:48,120
or, "how is it that
you can be functional?"

2435
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:51,500
There can even be fractures
in families and relationships

2436
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:54,970
on the basis of differences in
rates of grieving and so on.

2437
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:56,500
Well, some of this, again,

2438
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,790
probably relates to psychology

2439
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:58,740
and the different attachments

2440
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:00,400
that people had to the person or animal

2441
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,360
or thing that was lost,

2442
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,200
but it no doubt also has to do

2443
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,340
with how much of a mind/body connection,

2444
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:09,504
how much vagal tone exists in the person,

2445
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:13,510
when they suddenly found
themselves in the grief episode.

2446
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:15,780
So this actually offers
multiple opportunities.

2447
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:17,370
If you're somebody, for instance,

2448
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:20,900
who is grieving so intensely and so often

2449
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,700
that you're finding it immensely difficult

2450
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:25,260
to move through grief
at a reasonable rate,

2451
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:27,280
and you might even say, or find yourself

2452
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,170
diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder

2453
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,650
or with complicated grief syndrome

2454
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,120
in a way that's really impairing

2455
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,820
your adaptive functioning in life,

2456
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:38,210
well then, it's not clear to me,

2457
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,600
at least by my read of the data,

2458
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,030
that you would want to
engage in a lot of practices

2459
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:45,080
to increase the mind/body relationship

2460
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,900
and feeling so much of this attachment,

2461
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,950
because you're already feeling
an immense amount of it.

2462
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:52,740
Whereas other people who
are feeling challenged

2463
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:55,700
in accessing the feelings of attachment,

2464
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:57,810
and perhaps not functioning well

2465
01:40:57,810 --> 01:40:59,330
as a consequence of that,

2466
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:02,110
might find that practicing breathing

2467
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:05,350
in order to encourage
respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

2468
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:08,320
again, focusing on slowing
your heart rate consciously

2469
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,240
while you exhale,

2470
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,447
and concentrating on
increasing your heart rate

2471
01:41:11,447 --> 01:41:12,620
as you inhale,

2472
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:13,900
even just as a brief practice

2473
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:16,770
of even just one to three
minutes or one to five minutes,

2474
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:18,580
every once in a while or per day,

2475
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:19,960
that could be immensely beneficial

2476
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,560
in building this mind/body relationship.

2477
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,670
Because again, what this
paper really points to

2478
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:26,940
and set off a number of other
investigations related to,

2479
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,910
is that for those that can really feel

2480
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:31,828
the relationship between
breathing heart rate,

2481
01:41:31,828 --> 01:41:34,020
what we call vagal tone,

2482
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:37,310
well, those people are going
to be in a better position

2483
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:38,160
to move through grief,

2484
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,460
not because they are disengaging

2485
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,000
from the feelings of attachment,

2486
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,470
but because they are better able

2487
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:45,780
to access those feelings of attachment.

2488
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:49,530
So what this relates to of
course is that tripartite map,

2489
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:52,480
that three-part map that
we talked about earlier,

2490
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,710
that representation of
space, where things are,

2491
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,500
where the person is, where
their belongings are,

2492
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,108
where their car is,
where their bicycle is,

2493
01:41:59,108 --> 01:42:02,530
time, when you were expecting to see them

2494
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:03,363
on a regular basis,

2495
01:42:03,363 --> 01:42:05,200
when they would call,

2496
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,520
when they would come home
from work, et cetera,

2497
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,100
and that third node,

2498
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:10,680
or that third dimension of attachment,

2499
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,620
which is literally
attachment and closeness.

2500
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,290
Well, what we're talking about here

2501
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:17,090
is anchoring to that attachment

2502
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,430
and really feeling into that,

2503
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:22,316
but then disengaging from
the space and time map

2504
01:42:22,316 --> 01:42:24,460
that we call episodic memory,

2505
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:26,610
that menu of prior experiences,

2506
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:28,290
that keeps us in many ways,

2507
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:30,970
maladaptively in an expectation

2508
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:32,910
of what never can be again.

2509
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,280
Now I'd like to take a moment and consider

2510
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,210
some of the tools that you can access

2511
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:39,710
that support healthy
transitioning through grief.

2512
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:42,150
And these are tools distinct
from that neural map,

2513
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:44,410
that space, time and
closeness attachment map

2514
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,130
that we were talking about before.

2515
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:48,430
Rather, it's important to remind ourselves

2516
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:50,790
that everything exists

2517
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:54,150
in a context of our baseline physiology.

2518
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:56,180
And I'm certainly not
going to be the first

2519
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:59,310
or the last to tell you
that everything in life,

2520
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:02,363
learning, relationships with
people that are still around,

2521
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:06,010
our health in every way,
immune system, et cetera,

2522
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:08,890
function far better when
we're sleeping really well,

2523
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:12,170
and when we are generally
awake during the daytime

2524
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:13,520
and asleep at night.

2525
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,420
I realize there are
shift workers out there,

2526
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,690
people who are traveling
and are jet-lagged.

2527
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,630
First of all, thank you, shift workers.

2528
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:20,640
We rely on you.

2529
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,040
We have an episode all about
jet lag and shift work,

2530
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,040
for you and for trying to maintain

2531
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,070
the best possible mental
and physical health

2532
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:29,420
in the face of ongoing
shift work and jet lag.

2533
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:30,480
You can find that episode

2534
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,280
on our website, hubermanlab.com.

2535
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,203
Lots of behavioral tools,
some other tools as well.

2536
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,480
Nonetheless, human beings are diurnal.

2537
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,640
We were really designed to
be awake mostly in the day

2538
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:43,970
and asleep at night.

2539
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:45,120
There are rare exceptions to this

2540
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,840
where people like to stay
up late and sleep in late.

2541
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,300
But we are a diurnal species,

2542
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:51,305
by way of our genetic wiring

2543
01:43:51,305 --> 01:43:54,560
and our neural circuit wiring.

2544
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,300
There's a particular
feature to our diurnal,

2545
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,560
and diurnal, meaning the
opposite of nocturnal,

2546
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:02,750
our diurnal pattern of the release

2547
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,850
of a hormone called cortisol.

2548
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:07,670
Cortisol is a stress hormone,
it's sometimes called,

2549
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,940
but cortisol has a lot of other effects,

2550
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,890
many of which are positive.

2551
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:14,110
Cortisol for instance,
protects us against infection.

2552
01:44:14,110 --> 01:44:17,130
It can help us in terms of
waking up in the morning.

2553
01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:19,500
In fact, the pulse as it's called

2554
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,890
or the spike in cortisol early in the day

2555
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,250
is part of the reason we wake up.

2556
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:26,220
It's linked to our increase
in temperature rhythms,

2557
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:28,970
and can further increase our temperature,

2558
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,620
which leads to waking, and so on.

2559
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,370
The typical pattern of cortisol
in a healthy individual,

2560
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:36,400
and we really can say physically

2561
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,490
and emotionally healthy individual,

2562
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:40,500
is that cortisol is going to be

2563
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,770
somewhat high right around waking,

2564
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:46,100
and then is going to be
highest as it ever will be

2565
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:49,620
in the 24-hour period, about
45 minutes post waking,

2566
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:52,760
not exactly 45 minutes,
but about 45 minutes.

2567
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:55,450
And then it will drop gradually,

2568
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:58,210
such that by about 4:00
p.m. in the afternoon,

2569
01:44:58,210 --> 01:44:59,805
which is actually when body temperature

2570
01:44:59,805 --> 01:45:02,350
tends to start to drop as well,

2571
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:04,060
cortisol tends to be very low,

2572
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:07,160
and then remains low in
a healthy individual,

2573
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,720
such that at 9:00 p.m., it's very low.

2574
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,020
And throughout the night
as we sleep, it's very low.

2575
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:16,220
In fact, spikes or pulses
in 9:00 p.m. cortisol

2576
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:20,370
are a fairly reliable biomarker readout

2577
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:23,100
of certain forms of depression
and chronic anxiety.

2578
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,220
This relates to the beautiful
work of my colleagues

2579
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,900
at Stanford and Stanford
School of Medicine,

2580
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,950
Dr. David Spiegel, who's
been on this podcast,

2581
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:33,453
and Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who
has also been on this podcast.

2582
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:36,660
There's a very interesting paper

2583
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,040
exploring the relationship

2584
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:42,270
between cortisol rhythms
and grieving, in particular,

2585
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:44,490
complicated versus
non-complicated grieving.

2586
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:46,380
Again, complicated grieving
being the form of grieving

2587
01:45:46,380 --> 01:45:49,460
that reflects a immense challenge

2588
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:51,020
of people moving through
the grieving process,

2589
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:54,490
such that it really needs
to be dealt with, right?

2590
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:56,980
Again, grieving is healthy,
but complicated grieving

2591
01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:58,160
is a prolonged grieving,

2592
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,640
and has other dimensions as well,

2593
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,880
hence the name complicated.

2594
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,757
The title of this paper is,

2595
01:46:02,757 --> 01:46:06,550
"Diurnal Cortisol in Complicated
and Non-Complicated Grief,

2596
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:09,090
Slope Differences Across the Day."

2597
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:11,810
And the figure to orient to in this paper,

2598
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:13,230
if you do decide to check it out,

2599
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:15,064
and we'll put a link to it,

2600
01:46:15,064 --> 01:46:18,780
is Figure One, which beautifully shows,

2601
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:21,690
or I should say very clearly shows,

2602
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:26,130
that in individuals that are
experiencing complicated grief,

2603
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:28,070
there's the same general contour

2604
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:30,060
of high cortisol upon waking,

2605
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,600
even higher about 45 minutes after waking,

2606
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,300
and then a reduction in
cortisol by 4:00 p.m.,

2607
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:37,280
and even further reduction by 9:00 p.m.,

2608
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,770
so just as it were in
a typical individual,

2609
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,630
or somebody who is in
non-complicated grieving.

2610
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:45,007
However, when you compare
the cortisol levels

2611
01:46:45,007 --> 01:46:48,030
between people experiencing
complicated grieving

2612
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:49,730
versus non-complicated grieving,

2613
01:46:49,730 --> 01:46:51,615
what you find is the 4:00 p.m.

2614
01:46:51,615 --> 01:46:54,010
and 9:00 p.m. cortisol levels

2615
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:56,425
are significantly higher than they are

2616
01:46:56,425 --> 01:46:59,570
in the non-complicated grieving group.

2617
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:02,020
This raises a very interesting idea,

2618
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:03,510
and relates very closely

2619
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:06,120
to what we were talking
about with vagal tone.

2620
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,670
You could imagine a situation

2621
01:47:07,670 --> 01:47:11,390
in which people who are
experiencing complicated grief

2622
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:14,880
have higher levels of afternoon
and nighttime cortisol,

2623
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,280
because they are in complicated grief,

2624
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,290
but you could also imagine the opposite,

2625
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:21,730
that they're experiencing
complicated grief

2626
01:47:21,730 --> 01:47:24,970
because of the fact that
they have elevated cortisol.

2627
01:47:24,970 --> 01:47:27,820
Now, it's very likely
that it's bidirectional,

2628
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,190
that the answer isn't one
or the other, but both,

2629
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:34,580
that complicated grief
changes patterns of cortisol,

2630
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:37,260
and that patterns of cortisol
change the likelihood

2631
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,870
that one has complicated grief.

2632
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:43,090
That's the most logical
interpretation of data like these.

2633
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:47,330
However, when taken along
with the data on vagal tone,

2634
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:50,640
that people who have a
higher level of vagal tone

2635
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:54,850
are better able to navigate
situations of the sort

2636
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:56,110
that we're talking about,

2637
01:47:56,110 --> 01:48:00,010
and that some people perhaps
have oxytocin receptors

2638
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:02,750
or patterns of catecholamines
or epinephrine,

2639
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,390
that position them to be more likely

2640
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:06,030
to grieve in a particular way,

2641
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:09,877
we arrive at a scenario where
it makes very good sense

2642
01:48:09,877 --> 01:48:12,230
to think about modulating,

2643
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:15,210
that is controlling the
foundation of your life,

2644
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:18,080
in a way that establishes
cortisol rhythms,

2645
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,190
and sleep patterns,

2646
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:22,750
and patterns of autonomic
arousal and catecholamine release

2647
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,834
that position you to
navigate the grief process

2648
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:27,712
in the best possible way.

2649
01:48:27,712 --> 01:48:30,410
If that was a complicated
mouthful to digest,

2650
01:48:30,410 --> 01:48:32,524
let me restate it in a simpler way.

2651
01:48:32,524 --> 01:48:35,598
If you are somebody who
is heading into grief

2652
01:48:35,598 --> 01:48:37,350
or is challenged with grief,

2653
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:39,000
complicated grief, or otherwise,

2654
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,535
prolonged grief or otherwise,

2655
01:48:41,535 --> 01:48:43,424
getting adequate sleep at night

2656
01:48:43,424 --> 01:48:48,424
and establishing as normal a
pattern of cortisol as possible

2657
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:51,260
is going to be very important.

2658
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,620
And there's a very simple,
straightforward way to do this.

2659
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:56,170
And I apologize to the listeners
of this podcast in advance,

2660
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:57,510
if I sound like a repeating record,

2661
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:59,940
but the most powerful way to do this

2662
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:03,970
is to view sunlight, very close to waking.

2663
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:05,630
It does not have to be right at sunrise,

2664
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:07,770
but when you get up in the morning,

2665
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:09,500
if the sun isn't out,

2666
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,080
please turn on as many bright lights

2667
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:14,093
as possible in your environment.

2668
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:16,480
And then once the sun is out,

2669
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:18,850
try and get some bright
sunlight in your eyes.

2670
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:21,250
Never look at any light so bright

2671
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:23,990
that it's painful to look
at, sunlight or otherwise.

2672
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,360
If you live in an area of the world

2673
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,460
where there isn't a lot of sunlight,

2674
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,660
please keep in mind that sunlight
coming through cloud cover

2675
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:31,789
is going to still be a
very effective mechanism

2676
01:49:31,789 --> 01:49:33,930
for establishing this cortisol rhythm.

2677
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,250
Why do I say this thing about sunlight

2678
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:36,730
over and over and over again?

2679
01:49:36,730 --> 01:49:39,690
Well, having an early day cortisol peak

2680
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:43,810
and a very low cortisol
level late in the day,

2681
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:47,330
4:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.,
is immensely beneficial.

2682
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,810
It's, reflects a properly regulated

2683
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,980
autonomic nervous system.

2684
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:52,290
It means being alert during the day.

2685
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:55,320
And your ability to sleep at
night is tightly correlated

2686
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,690
to this viewing of
sunlight in the morning.

2687
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:59,680
If you have additional
questions about this

2688
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,539
or these protocols,

2689
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:03,940
please see our "Mastering
Sleep" episode also

2690
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:04,980
at hubermanlab.com.

2691
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:07,860
But in brief, you don't
want to wear sunglasses

2692
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:08,693
when you do this.

2693
01:50:08,693 --> 01:50:10,070
You do not want to do this

2694
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:11,770
through a window or a windshield.

2695
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:13,760
It is 50 times less effective at least,

2696
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,750
because of filtering of
the proper wavelengths.

2697
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:18,130
It is fine to wear eyeglasses,

2698
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:19,790
meaning corrective lenses or contacts,

2699
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:21,450
even if they have UV protection.

2700
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:24,250
Again, sunlight is best
10 minutes to 30 minutes,

2701
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,610
depending on how bright it is outside,

2702
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:27,300
and so on and so forth.

2703
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,750
I keep coming back to this protocol,

2704
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:31,460
because first of all, it is a zero cost,

2705
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:35,490
but very effective way to regulate things

2706
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:37,420
like cortisol rhythms, melatonin rhythms,

2707
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:39,000
wakefulness during the day,

2708
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,280
ease of falling asleep
at night, and so on,

2709
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:44,010
and second of all, because
I want to emphasize

2710
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:46,000
this idea of modulation.

2711
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,010
There are processes in our brain and body

2712
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:50,969
which directly mediate
some psychological effect

2713
01:50:50,969 --> 01:50:53,030
or physiological effect, right?

2714
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:55,950
Dopamine is directly
involved in motivation.

2715
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:58,520
If you're somebody who
struggles with motivation,

2716
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,880
your dopamine system is likely

2717
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,330
to be dysregulated in some way.

2718
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:02,163
And there are behavioral tools

2719
01:51:02,163 --> 01:51:03,890
and other tools to adjust that.

2720
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:06,230
We had an episode on
dopamine motivation and drive

2721
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:08,639
that talks extensively about those tools.

2722
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,750
However, the process of
grief can't be distilled

2723
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:15,140
down to one molecule, one circuit,

2724
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:17,460
such that we can say, "Oh,
you know, take this supplement

2725
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:20,830
or eat this diet and/or
exercise in the following way,

2726
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:23,530
and you'll recover from
grief more quickly."

2727
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:24,900
It's simply not the case.

2728
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:25,980
It is the case, however,

2729
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:29,240
that proper sleep at
night sets the foundation

2730
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:32,240
for the proper emotional tone,

2731
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:35,680
to be able to navigate
physical, psychological,

2732
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,930
and other types of challenges,

2733
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:40,780
and not incidentally, sleep at night,

2734
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:42,170
I should say, sufficient duration

2735
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:43,850
and quality of sleep at night

2736
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:46,160
is the way in which you
engage neuroplasticity,

2737
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,000
the reordering of neural connections,

2738
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,470
and everything we've
been talking about today

2739
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:52,720
about reordering of the maps in your mind.

2740
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,150
This tripartite, three-part map

2741
01:51:54,150 --> 01:51:57,590
of space, time, and closeness
involves neuroplasticity,

2742
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:00,500
the reconfiguring of
connections between neurons,

2743
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,030
strengthening certain pathways,

2744
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:03,560
and not strengthening others,

2745
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:07,120
actively trying to disengage
from the what if, right,

2746
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,300
this counterintuitive thinking,

2747
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:11,230
actively trying to disengage
from the expectations

2748
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:12,640
that someone will be there,

2749
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,210
although when you find
yourself doing that,

2750
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:18,410
understanding why it's so
reflexive and normal to do that,

2751
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:20,870
actively trying to lean
into the real attachment

2752
01:52:20,870 --> 01:52:24,270
to somebody, animal, or thing,

2753
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:28,490
and yet at the same time,
not deluding yourself

2754
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:30,920
and undermining the whole
process of grieving,

2755
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,750
by trying to imagine that they are in fact

2756
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:34,680
still, truly there, right?

2757
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:38,250
It's a very narrow
knife edge of a process,

2758
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,410
which is why it's so challenging.

2759
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:43,110
Regulating your cortisol
rhythm through viewing sunlight

2760
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:45,400
early in the day, and I should also say,

2761
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,437
avoiding bright lights
from artificial sources

2762
01:52:47,437 --> 01:52:51,050
in the evening, generally
10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m,

2763
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:53,530
but certainly in the evening,

2764
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:56,010
trying to dim lights in
your immediate environment,

2765
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:57,640
trying to avoid bright screens,

2766
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,920
bright artificial lights
as much as possible,

2767
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,520
and accessing that deep sleep,

2768
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,580
that's modulating, it's setting
an overall autonomic state

2769
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:08,350
or an overall autonomic landscape,

2770
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:10,200
would be the better way to describe it,

2771
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,570
that's going to allow you to sleep

2772
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:12,590
and get neuroplasticity,

2773
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:14,340
sleep and be in the best emotional state

2774
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:15,780
to navigate the grieving process.

2775
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,210
Because it's only fair to say

2776
01:53:18,210 --> 01:53:21,740
that the grieving process as
we're describing it is hard,

2777
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:23,490
and not just because
it's emotionally hard.

2778
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:24,970
It's cognitively hard.

2779
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:26,420
You just think about what's required

2780
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,960
to move through grief
properly, if you will.

2781
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,170
It's thinking about,

2782
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:35,040
and actually physically
experiencing the depth,

2783
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,580
the full depth of the
attachment to the person,

2784
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:39,470
while at the same time trying to uncouple

2785
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:43,464
from that rich menu, that
catalog of episodic memories

2786
01:53:43,464 --> 01:53:45,680
that can date back many, many years

2787
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:46,830
and have so much richness.

2788
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:49,930
So many predictions form on the basis

2789
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:51,240
of those episodic memories,

2790
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,440
and actively trying to distance ourselves

2791
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,410
from those memories,

2792
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:56,780
by being very anchored in
the fact that we are present,

2793
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:58,710
we are the person alone in that room,

2794
01:53:58,710 --> 01:54:02,270
or in some cases with a
bereavement group in that room,

2795
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:04,430
or with other people that
are mourning the loss

2796
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:06,097
of that individual, animal, or thing,

2797
01:54:06,097 --> 01:54:11,097
and that knife edge of feeling
the intense attachment,

2798
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,920
while also disengaging from all the things

2799
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,693
that led to that attachment.

2800
01:54:16,693 --> 01:54:18,490
Well, it's understandable

2801
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:20,090
why that would be so challenging,

2802
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:22,091
and it should also be understandable

2803
01:54:22,091 --> 01:54:24,710
why positioning yourself
to be able to do that

2804
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:28,020
in the best possible way
requires proper sleep.

2805
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:30,630
So what are the tools that
we can think about using,

2806
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:33,450
in terms of healthy, adaptive
moving through grief,

2807
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:35,270
trying to avoid complicated grief

2808
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:38,450
and prolonged grief disorders?

2809
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:41,050
I realize that word disorder
implies all sorts of things,

2810
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:43,376
but again, those are just
naming categorizations

2811
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:45,019
that people come up with,

2812
01:54:45,019 --> 01:54:47,870
that I think fairly reflect the fact

2813
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:49,710
that some people have more challenge

2814
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:51,830
moving through grieving than others.

2815
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:54,130
And for some people it
can be very extended.

2816
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:56,640
I think the common misunderstanding

2817
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,700
is that proper grieving involves

2818
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:01,100
moving through something quickly.

2819
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,400
We're certainly not saying that.

2820
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,140
However, it is very clear that
some people can get stuck,

2821
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:09,280
and that process of getting stuck,

2822
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,730
you should now understand,

2823
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:13,560
has a lot to do with maintaining

2824
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,710
or reactivating those episodic memories,

2825
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:18,330
those expectations of
where somebody will be

2826
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:19,463
in space and time.

2827
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:23,460
So what can we say about the
tools for moving through grief?

2828
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:27,320
Clearly it's of value to
dedicate some period of time,

2829
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,770
perhaps every day,
perhaps every other day,

2830
01:55:29,770 --> 01:55:32,193
depending on your capacity and schedule.

2831
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,940
These could be periods
of time ranging anywhere

2832
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:37,323
from five to 45 minutes, maybe longer.

2833
01:55:38,610 --> 01:55:42,270
These blocks of time would
be appropriately described

2834
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:44,980
as rational grieving, right?

2835
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:47,820
Rational grieving is a clear acceptance

2836
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:50,420
of the new reality that
the person, animal,

2837
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,800
or thing no longer exists

2838
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,990
in the same space/time dimensionality

2839
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:55,480
that we knew them before,

2840
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,830
and yet holding on to an anchoring

2841
01:55:57,830 --> 01:56:00,120
to the attachment that we had.

2842
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:03,870
This is again, not an unhealthy
anchoring to the attachment.

2843
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:05,617
This is really anchoring to the depth

2844
01:56:05,617 --> 01:56:08,500
and the intensity of the
attachment that existed,

2845
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:12,660
as a way to, for lack of
a better way to put it,

2846
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:15,198
push off from those episodic memories,

2847
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:16,870
to distance ourselves from them.

2848
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:19,470
Because those episodic
memories are the ones

2849
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,850
that lead us to look for the
person in our current reality.

2850
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:25,593
And assuming this is a
real and complete loss,

2851
01:56:25,593 --> 01:56:28,840
those sorts of expectations
are maladaptive.

2852
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,253
They do not serve us well.

2853
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:33,302
The second aspect of this is to understand

2854
01:56:33,302 --> 01:56:36,160
that the node of the map,

2855
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:40,160
the component of the neural
map that you're anchoring to,

2856
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,700
is a very real component of you.

2857
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,760
These are literally cells

2858
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:45,110
that represent the depth of attachment.

2859
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:47,460
They are linked up with your
emotional centers in the brain,

2860
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,540
and indeed they're
linked up with your body.

2861
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:51,594
I think one of the things
that comes up so often

2862
01:56:51,594 --> 01:56:54,960
when people are grieving is
why does it hurt so much?

2863
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,600
Well, that hurt is that yearning.

2864
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,410
It's that anticipation of action

2865
01:56:59,410 --> 01:57:01,210
that you want to engage in,

2866
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:04,830
but some part of you at least
knows that it leads nowhere.

2867
01:57:04,830 --> 01:57:06,630
It's that reaching for that glass of water

2868
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:08,842
in a kind of desert of thirst,

2869
01:57:08,842 --> 01:57:11,010
and you know you can't have it.

2870
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:12,130
That's why it hurts so badly,

2871
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:14,370
because the systems of your brain and body

2872
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:17,680
are in a place of
anticipation of readiness.

2873
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,490
And given the activation of
these brain reward systems

2874
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:22,970
like the nucleus accumbens,

2875
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:25,390
given your now understanding of oxytocin,

2876
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:28,964
being more enriched in
the nucleus accumbens

2877
01:57:28,964 --> 01:57:33,320
of some individuals and
as opposed to others,

2878
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,320
it should make perfect sense

2879
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,460
as to why it's so painful in your body.

2880
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:40,110
We talked a moment ago about
the importance of accessing

2881
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:42,340
quality sleep on a regular basis,

2882
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,960
gave you at least one tool to do that.

2883
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,790
There are again, a rich
array of tools to do that

2884
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:48,450
in the "Mastering Sleep" episode.

2885
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:50,505
And again, highlighting
the importance of sleep

2886
01:57:50,505 --> 01:57:54,830
for not just emotion regulation
and autonomic control,

2887
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:56,840
which is so vital, but
also for making sure

2888
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,410
that neuroplasticity takes place.

2889
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:00,680
Because again, neuroplasticity
is a two-part process.

2890
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,190
There's the triggering of the plasticity,

2891
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:04,180
which in the case of the things

2892
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:05,013
we're talking about today,

2893
01:58:05,013 --> 01:58:08,040
will be naturally
activated by the practice

2894
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,360
of a dedicated focusing on the attachment,

2895
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:11,690
feeling the attachment to the person,

2896
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:14,200
maybe even writing about the
attachment to the person,

2897
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,410
as was described in that previous study,

2898
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:20,080
but also just the
plasticity is triggered by

2899
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:21,750
the mere loss of that person,

2900
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:23,100
the intensity of that experience.

2901
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:26,270
But neuroplasticity, the
literal rewiring of connections,

2902
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:28,470
occurs during deep sleep

2903
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:31,057
and in what I call
non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.

2904
01:58:31,057 --> 01:58:32,850
And you can find NSDR scripts,

2905
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:34,780
these are short behavioral protocols

2906
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:36,700
that you do for 10 to 30 minutes

2907
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,740
at some point throughout the day,

2908
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:38,970
maybe even multiple
times through your day,

2909
01:58:38,970 --> 01:58:41,863
that have been shown to
accelerate neuroplasticity.

2910
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:45,650
So having a such a practice
can be very useful,

2911
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:48,870
and understand that it
involves some cognitive work.

2912
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:50,480
We have to hold onto the attachment,

2913
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,570
and imagine and feel as much
as we can, the attachment,

2914
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:57,410
while also being extremely
rationally grounded,

2915
01:58:57,410 --> 01:59:01,490
and trying to not try
to hold onto the past,

2916
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:04,450
trying to not anticipate the
person walking in the room.

2917
01:59:04,450 --> 01:59:06,400
This is very hard because

2918
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,630
when we think about the attachment,

2919
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:10,310
the attachment tends to drag with it

2920
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:11,800
those episodic memories,

2921
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,720
that rich catalog of experiences.

2922
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:15,630
The expectation that they
will walk in the room

2923
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,300
is perfectly natural.

2924
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:18,812
The hard cognitive work

2925
01:59:18,812 --> 01:59:23,170
is to experience the deep,
emotional attachment,

2926
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:25,570
while at the same time severing from

2927
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:28,860
or distancing ourselves
from these expectations

2928
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:30,700
that they'll suddenly
show up in our reality,

2929
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:32,193
when in fact, they won't.

2930
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:36,840
And we talked about preparing
ourselves for grief, right?

2931
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:39,290
If we have a loved one that's dying,

2932
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:41,360
or we anticipate that at some point

2933
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:43,710
we are going to have a loss of some sort,

2934
01:59:43,710 --> 01:59:44,543
could be death,

2935
01:59:44,543 --> 01:59:46,090
could be a loss of another type,

2936
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:47,560
breakup, et cetera,

2937
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:51,460
that we can prepare ourselves
to grieve more adaptively

2938
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:54,140
by regulating the level of catecholamines,

2939
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:55,650
in particular epinephrine,

2940
01:59:55,650 --> 01:59:57,540
that was well-described in the study

2941
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:58,930
that I referred to earlier,

2942
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:01,010
and tools such as the one found

2943
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:02,570
in our "Mastering Stress" episode,

2944
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:05,290
and tools of the sort that
we talked about today,

2945
02:00:05,290 --> 02:00:07,310
increasing that vagal tone

2946
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:10,080
by actively building up the relationship

2947
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:13,060
between exhales and slowing
down of the heart rate,

2948
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:15,180
so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

2949
02:00:15,180 --> 02:00:16,730
Those things can be very useful tools.

2950
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:20,500
So we can actually
encourage our nervous system

2951
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,770
and build our nervous system

2952
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:23,810
and build our mind to prepare for grief

2953
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:25,463
when it inevitably will come.

2954
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:28,490
Again, this is not about
buffering ourselves

2955
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:29,690
from the realities of life.

2956
02:00:29,690 --> 02:00:33,390
This is not about disengaging from grief

2957
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:35,410
as a real and important process.

2958
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:38,680
And indeed, it is a real and
important process to engage in.

2959
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:40,910
Those that enter denial,

2960
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:43,820
or try and distract
themselves with substances

2961
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:47,450
or thinking or distracting of behavior,

2962
02:00:47,450 --> 02:00:49,200
substances or otherwise,

2963
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,830
won't move through grief
as well, as adaptively,

2964
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:54,223
as those who embrace a process of the sort

2965
02:00:54,223 --> 02:00:55,490
that I'm describing here.

2966
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:58,121
And of course, I want to restate again,

2967
02:00:58,121 --> 02:01:01,240
that even though grief and depression

2968
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:04,260
are now known to be
fundamentally different,

2969
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:05,540
even though people move through

2970
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:06,700
the different stages of grief

2971
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,990
at different rates and sometimes
skip stages, et cetera,

2972
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:11,168
it is often important to access

2973
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:13,240
a trained professional psychologist,

2974
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,390
or psychiatrist, or both,

2975
02:01:15,390 --> 02:01:16,410
or bereavement group,

2976
02:01:16,410 --> 02:01:19,110
or all of the above,

2977
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:21,630
in order to get the proper
support for grieving.

2978
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:26,630
So this is a podcast about
science and science-based tools,

2979
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:29,580
but I absolutely want to emphasize

2980
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:31,970
that there are terrific
resources out there

2981
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:33,510
that you can access.

2982
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:35,210
I don't say this in any kind of glib

2983
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:37,560
or kind of pass the buck kind of way.

2984
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,930
There are wonderful trained therapists,

2985
02:01:40,930 --> 02:01:45,730
bereavement groups,
psychiatrists that are expert

2986
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:47,730
in navigating these sorts of things.

2987
02:01:47,730 --> 02:01:49,080
I like to think that the tools

2988
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,690
that we've talked about today

2989
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:52,590
would be not only compatible,

2990
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:54,010
but would be complementary

2991
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:56,270
to the sorts of approaches that they take.

2992
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:59,510
And as we think about
this process of grief,

2993
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:02,610
as we all should at
some point in our lives,

2994
02:02:02,610 --> 02:02:04,560
because we all indeed
will experience grief

2995
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,710
in one form or another,

2996
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:10,160
I would hope that the information
that we discussed today

2997
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:13,120
would not only give you some tools,

2998
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,000
but hopefully give you
a better understanding

2999
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,530
of not just the people that you've lost

3000
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:18,570
or that you stand to lose,

3001
02:02:18,570 --> 02:02:21,800
not just the animals that
you've lost and stand to lose,

3002
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:24,040
but also give you a sense of why it is

3003
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:26,127
that the people who are still in your life

3004
02:02:26,127 --> 02:02:27,200
and that you're attached to,

3005
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,610
the animals that are still in your life,

3006
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:30,060
that you're attached to,

3007
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:31,880
have such profound meaning for you.

3008
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,150
And I would encourage you
to not lean away from,

3009
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:37,270
but rather to lean into the building

3010
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:39,260
of those episodic memories,

3011
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:42,750
to build up a richer and
richer set of experiences

3012
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,600
and emotional attachments.

3013
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,303
Because while the process of grieving

3014
02:02:46,303 --> 02:02:48,930
is in direct relation to how close

3015
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,220
we are attached to people,

3016
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:51,900
there are ways to move through it.

3017
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:54,530
And of course it is the
depth of our attachments,

3018
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:56,510
and the number and the depth of meaning

3019
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:59,590
of experiences that we share
with others and with animals

3020
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:02,320
that makes life so rich and worth living.

3021
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,200
So I just want to take a
moment and say thank you

3022
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:07,940
for being willing to explore
this rather complicated,

3023
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:10,570
and sometimes extremely challenging thing

3024
02:03:10,570 --> 02:03:11,740
that we call grief,

3025
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:13,590
from the perspective or through the lens

3026
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:15,740
of neuroscience and psychology.

3027
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:18,260
I certainly learned a lot in
exploring this literature.

3028
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:21,010
I also really look
forward to hosting people

3029
02:03:21,010 --> 02:03:23,970
like Dr. O'Connor on the podcast,

3030
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:25,143
and others on the podcast

3031
02:03:25,143 --> 02:03:27,980
who've done such beautiful
work in this area.

3032
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:28,920
I've put out the request,

3033
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,130
and hopefully they'll join us soon

3034
02:03:30,130 --> 02:03:32,450
to further elaborate and teach us

3035
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:36,290
about this fundamental
component of our lives.

3036
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:38,960

That's the best way to support us.

3050
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,770
Not during today's episode,

3051
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:10,140
but on many previous episodes

3052
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:11,690
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3053
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:13,150
we've discussed supplements.

3054
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:14,990
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

3055
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:17,340
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,

3056
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,470
for things like easing and accelerating

3057
02:04:19,470 --> 02:04:21,830
the transition time into sleep,

3058
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:24,000
and getting better, deeper sleep,

3059
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,070
as well as things such
as focus, et cetera.

3060
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:29,250
We've partnered with
Momentous Supplements,

3061
02:04:29,250 --> 02:04:30,860
because Momentous
Supplements, first of all,

3062
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:32,960
are of extremely high quality.

3063
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,420
That's obviously important.

3064
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,060
Also, they ship internationally.

3065
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,160
We had heard from many of you

3066
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:38,290
that you were having trouble

3067
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,456
accessing some of the supplements

3068
02:04:39,456 --> 02:04:42,040
that were described on
the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3069
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,310
because you did not live in the U.S.

3070
02:04:43,310 --> 02:04:46,620
Momentous ships both
within the U.S. and abroad.

3071
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:48,219
And many of you have also requested

3072
02:04:48,219 --> 02:04:50,250
that there be a single site

3073
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:52,660
where you could access
all of the supplements

3074
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:55,580
that we've talked about on
the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3075
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:59,300
Right now at livemomentous.com/huberman,

3076
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:01,390
you can find a subset of the supplements

3077
02:05:01,390 --> 02:05:03,280
that have been described on this podcast.

3078
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,720
Again, all of the very highest quality.

3079
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:07,480
Each, single-ingredient supplements.

3080
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:08,570
That turns out to be very important

3081
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,485
if you're trying to develop

3082
02:05:09,485 --> 02:05:11,510
the proper array of supplements for you.

3083
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:13,370
It's not helpful to have supplements

3084
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:14,580
that include many ingredients,

3085
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:16,320
so we encouraged Momentous

3086
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,053
to have single-ingredient supplements

3087
02:05:18,053 --> 02:05:20,530
with dosages that allow you to build up

3088
02:05:20,530 --> 02:05:23,850
from the minimal
effective dose, and so on.

3089
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,100
And the catalog of supplements

3090
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:26,761
they are going to add to that location,

3091
02:05:26,761 --> 02:05:28,890
livemomentous.com/huberman,

3092
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:31,200
is going to expand in the
weeks and months to come.

3093
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:34,570
And we expect that in a
fairly short amount of time,

3094
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:36,080
all of the supplements
that we've described

3095
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:38,010
on the Huberman Lab Podcast will be there.

3096
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:39,770
If you're not already
following @hubermanlab

3097
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:41,560
on Instagram and Twitter,

3098
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:43,580
I post science and science-related tools

3099
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:47,663
@hubermanlab on Instagram,
also @hubermanlab on Twitter.

3100
02:05:47,663 --> 02:05:50,130
Oftentimes that material
will overlap somewhat

3101
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:52,160
with the content covered on this podcast,

3102
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,960
but more often than not,

3103
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,410
what I'm covering on Instagram and Twitter

3104
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:57,430
is distinct from the information I cover

3105
02:05:57,430 --> 02:05:59,190
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3106
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:02,690
We also have a newsletter that
has summaries of podcasts,

3107
02:06:02,690 --> 02:06:05,180
and points to specific protocols and links

3108
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:06,760
that could be useful to you.

3109
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:09,090
That is the Neural Network Newsletter,

3110
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:11,360
and you can find it at hubermanlab.com.

3111
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,800
Go to the menu, go to Newsletter.

3112
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,730
You can sign up simply
by giving us your email.

3113
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:16,780
We do not share your
email with anybody else.

3114
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:19,650
Our privacy policy is there,
and is made very clear.

3115
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:22,205
You can also see some
newsletters of months past,

3116
02:06:22,205 --> 02:06:23,900
so you can assess whether or not

3117
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:25,370
you really do want to sign up,

3118
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:26,840
although I like to think that you will.

3119
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:29,914
Again, zero cost, total
privacy of your email account,

3120
02:06:29,914 --> 02:06:32,650
and many people find those Summaries

3121
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:34,170
and Takeaway Tools to be very useful

3122
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:38,520
in navigating these admittedly
long podcast episodes.

3123
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,790
And last, but certainly not least,

3124
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:42,727
thank you for your interest in science.

3125
02:06:42,727 --> 02:06:46,810
