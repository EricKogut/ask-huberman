00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,910
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,760
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,816
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:05,816 --> 00:00:08,399
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,460
I'm Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,300
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,350
at Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,580
This podcast is separate

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,040
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford,

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,060
it is, however, part
of my desire and effort

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,150
to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

12
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,150
about science and science-related tools

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,960
to the general public.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,200
Before we begin today,
just want to acknowledge

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,890
that if you're watching this on YouTube,

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,880
yes, I have a bandage on
the left side of my face,

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,250
I was trying to cook
something for Costello and I

18
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,350
and I got burned, burned myself,
it was a cooking accident.

19
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,727
I'm fine, no need to dwell
on it, we can move on,

20
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:43,020
but I just wanted to let you know

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,070
everybody's going to be okay,

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,500
he got a great meal, I got
a burn and a great meal.

23
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,740
Today's episode is brought
to us by Four Sigmatic.

24
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,640
Four Sigmatic is a wellness company

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,720
that makes mushroom coffee.

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,830
For those of you that haven't heard

27
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,140
of mushroom coffee before,

28
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,340
I just want to make clear,

29
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,880
these are not psychedelic mushrooms,

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,890
and no, the coffee does not
taste like mushrooms at all.

31
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,200
It tastes amazing and
it tastes like coffee.

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,750
I started using Four Sigmatic
coffee a few years ago

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,270
and then we actually stocked it in my lab,

34
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,770
we still stock it in my lab

35
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,960
because it tastes really good

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,570
and it also happens to have
two types of mushrooms in it

37
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,170
that I particularly like

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,390
because of their supplement
and medicinal qualities,

39
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,000
and those two are lion's mane mushroom,

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,370
which has been shown in
several research studies

41
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,000
to have a mild anxiolytic,
meaning anti-anxiety effect,

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,540
and mood-elevating effect,

43
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,560
those are from research
studies done independently,

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,680
as well, it has Chaga mushroom,

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,160
Chaga mushroom has been shown
to increase growth factors

46
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,120
that impact the nervous system,
like nerve growth factor,

47
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,540
so that's the reason I drink it,

48
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,170
and that's the reason
we stock it in the lab,

49
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,260
and that's the reason
why I drink it at home.

50
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,960

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,293
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Blinkist.

59
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:18,180
Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of nonfiction books

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,190
condensed down to just 15
minutes of key takeaways

61
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,010
that you can read or listen to.

62
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,410
For me, I really like
listening to books on Blinkist,

63
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,360
even books that I've already read.

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,550
Typically, the way I consume information

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,370
is, unless it's fiction, I'll
listen to a nonfiction book

66
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,770
or I'll read the actual,
physical hard copy

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,110
of a nonfiction book,

68
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,170
and then at the end, I
like to take some notes

69
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,290
about things that really stuck with me

70
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,500
or key takeaways that I'd like to teach

71
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,140
or share with other people.

72
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,890
With Blinkist, it allows me
to go back to those books

73
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,710
and get all the essential items,

74
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,980
some of which I might have missed

75
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,540
in the course of listening to or reading

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,870
the full-length version,

77
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,480
and if I haven't read a book before,

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
it also gives me a sense of whether or not

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,770
I'd like to read the book.

80
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,880
Blinkist has some terrific
science category books,

81
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,677
for example, my colleague and
friend David Eagleman's book,

82
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:07,490
"Livewired," which came out recently,

83
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,170
is all about neuroplasticity,

84
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,720
it's a fantastic book, I
read the full-length book,

85
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,400
and I've listened to it on Blinkist,

86
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,290
and it's a terrific
synopsis of "Livewired,"

87
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,123
that's in there.

88
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,030
David Sinclair's book, "Lifespan,"

89
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,790
many of you probably
know that David Sinclair,

90
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,170
professor of genetics at
Harvard Medical School,

91
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,920
is a real pioneer in the
aging and longevity field,

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,450
his book "Lifespan" is terrific,

93
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,330
I've read the full-length
book, I've listened to it,

94
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,917
and I've listened to it on Blinkist,

95
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,300
and so it really captures a
lot of the essential elements

96
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,740
that you would want to get from that book.

97
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,090
Blinkist is also just a great way

98
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,040
to get through many books on the bookshelf

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,590
that you've been meaning to get
to but you haven't had time.

100
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,580
With Blinkist, you can
get unlimited access

101
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,180
to read or listen to a
massive library of books,

102
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,950
not just science books,

103
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,910
and they're all condensed in
this way of just 15 minutes

104
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,150
will allow you to get
all the key information,

105
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,840
so right now, for a limited time,

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,170

115
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,420
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Theragun.

116
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,200
Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device

117
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,550
that releases deep muscle tension.

118
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,050
I was introduced to Theragun

119
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,400
on a dive expedition for my
laboratory a few years ago.

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,960
On that expedition, we
were working very hard,

121
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,120
we were diving all day,

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
we were carrying pelican
cases with equipment,

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,090
we were carrying tanks,

124
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,180
very sore, very tired
by the end of the day,

125
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,910
as was everybody else.

126
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,420
Someone brought along a Theragun,

127
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,350
and pretty soon, that thing
was getting passed around

128
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,670
and became the most
coveted device on board

129
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,410
because it really works to relieve

130
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,770
the soreness and deep muscle tension

131
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,910
that accumulates with
physical work, exercise,

132
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,140
even just sitting too
long throughout the day,

133
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,100
so when I got back, I got a Theragun,

134
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,980
I still use the Theragun daily,

135
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,920
it's terrific because it's very quiet

136
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,010
so you can use it while watching a movie

137
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,410
or even while having a conversation

138
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,520
without it feeling intrusive,

139
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,130
it really gets down into the
meat of the muscle if you want,

140
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,090
or you can use it more
superficially if you like.

141
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,640
If you want to try Theragun,

142
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,060
you can go to theragun.com/huberman,

143
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,710
they have several models available,

144
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,750
the first one starts at $190,
which if you think about it,

145
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,690
is comparable to the price
of a professional massage

146
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,680
except that unlike a professional massage,

147
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,160
you can use the Theragun
for as long as you want

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,010
throughout the day and for
as many days as you like,

149
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,470
that's theragun.com/huberman,

150
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,480
and I should mention that there's

151
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,810
also a 30-day money-back guarantee,

152
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,850
so if you don't like the
product, you send it back,

153
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,200
you get your money back.

154
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
This month on the "Huberman Lab Podcast,"

155
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,950
we're talking all about hormones,

156
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,320
these incredible chemicals
that can impact our mood,

157
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,220
our behavior, our feelings
of optimism or pessimism.

158
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,720
The amazing thing about hormones

159
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,520
is that hormones impact all those things,

160
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
but all those things,

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,850
how we feel and what
we do and what we think

162
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,677
also can impact our hormones,

163
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:12,330
and so it's a really
fascinating area of biology

164
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,120
that impacts every single
one of us every day

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,270
both in wakefulness and in sleep

166
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,070
and throughout the lifespan.

167
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,910
Today, we're going to be talking
about hormone optimization,

168
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,740
and we're mainly going to be focusing

169
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,030
on estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives.

170
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,530
Last episode of the
"Huberman Lab Podcast,"

171
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,630
we talked about sexual development,

172
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,840
that is, how the chromosomes,
the gonads, and hormones

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,040
impact what we call sexual development,

174
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,930
leading all the way up to puberty.

175
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,420
Today, we're mainly going
to talk about processes

176
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,440
that happen from puberty onward,

177
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,422
although we might talk

178
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,050
a little bit about development as well,

179
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,930
so today, we're going to talk
a lot about basic biology,

180
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,600
but we're going to weave
in a lot of practical tools

181
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,500
along the way for how to optimize

182
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,750
these incredibly powerful
things that we call hormones.

183
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,270
Before we dive into our discussion

184
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,740
about hormone optimization,

185
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,570
I want to raise what I think
is a very important point

186
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,660
that at least I hadn't
heard of until recently,

187
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,620
which is the concept of salutogenesis.

188
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,810
Many of us are familiar with
the concept of pathogenesis,

189
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,970
the idea that there are
all these scary diseases

190
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,070
like dementia and heart
disease and stroke,

191
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,850
and all these things that await us

192
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,520
if we don't take good care of ourselves

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,340
and that might await us even if we do,

194
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,341
that's the pathogenic model,

195
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,140
salutogenesis is something I learned about

196
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,270
from one of my Stanford
Medicine colleagues,

197
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,660
which is a different orientation

198
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,790
toward health and well-being

199
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,540
where you're taking on
particular behaviors,

200
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,420
you're taking on a particular stance

201
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,820
towards nutrition and exercise,
supplementation, et cetera,

202
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,340
in order to promote well-being
above where you would be

203
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,323
if you were not doing those behaviors.

204
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:48,510
Now, if you think about
it, these two things,

205
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,860
salutogenesis and the pathogenic model,

206
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,220
are really two sides of the same coin,

207
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,720
but I'll just give an example

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,610
of how this might affect
you in a real way.

209
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,240
If you like exercise because
it feels good, great,

210
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,780
but many people exercise, or
eat well, for that matter,

211
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,250
in order to avoid heart
disease or to avoid dementia,

212
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,440
to avoid negative changes
in body composition,

213
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,000
and while that's powerful

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,980
and certainly is the case that exercise

215
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,140
will help you move away
from all those things,

216
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,950
the salutogenesis model differs

217
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,790
in that it involves a
mindset and an orientation

218
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,340
towards doing those things
in order to feels good,

219
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,280
in order to enhance your level of energy,

220
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,400
in order to improve endocrine function

221
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,950
and metabolic function,

222
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,830
so it's really part of
the pathogenic model,

223
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,460
and yet, salutogenesis is
really more of a mindset

224
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,770
toward why you would do
these particular behaviors,

225
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,409
and really, the most powerful mindset

226
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,519
is going to be one where you are thinking

227
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,860
about the pathogenic model,

228
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,680
doing things so that you
don't end up sick, et cetera,

229
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,370
and to move away from sickness,

230
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,270
as well as the salutogenic
model where you're doing things

231
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,760
in order to move towards
health and well-being.

232
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,730
We think of health and wellness nowadays,

233
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,700
or the wellness community
or wellness practices,

234
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,340
and in many ways,

235
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,940
that is the essence of
the salutogenic model,

236
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,380
but I found it very interesting

237
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,860
to know that within the
field of allopathic medicine,

238
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,930
these two models exist

239
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,880
but we don't hear about
the salutogenic model

240
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,050
quite as often,

241
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,350
so it's just something to keep in mind,

242
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,203
especially because of some
of the mindset effects

243
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:16,810
that were discussed in previous episodes,

244
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,530
I'm not going to go into these
in detail again right now,

245
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,280
but if you might recall from
the episode on food and mood,

246
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,170
we talked about some of
these incredible studies

247
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,220
that were done by Alia Crum's
group at Stanford and others

248
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,650
showing that if you tell people

249
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,840
that the behavior that
they're about to do,

250
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,200
in this case, it was people
cleaning up hotel rooms

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,380
because that was their job,

252
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,450
if you tell them that it's good for them,

253
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,450
then you see much greater
positive health effects

254
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,640
than if they aren't
aware of that information

255
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,710
that it's good for them,

256
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,880
so we should really be thinking

257
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,140
about not just moving away from
disease and negative things,

258
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,730
but also why certain
things are good for us

259
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,580
because it's well-established now

260
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,700
from really good scientific studies

261
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,480
that keeping in mind the
positive effects of things

262
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,920
can really have an outsized
effect on well-being,

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,020
right down to the level of our physiology.

264
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,710
So let's talk about hormone optimization,

265
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,590
today we're going to talk
about hormone optimization

266
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,360
in reference to estrogen and testosterone

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,950
and their derivatives,

268
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,720
now, estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives

269
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,180
are what we call sex steroids,

270
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,620
now, the sex steroids
immediately call to mind sex,

271
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,770
for obvious reasons,

272
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,770
and steroids, meaning anabolic steroids,

273
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,810
but I just want to emphasize
that estrogen and testosterone

274
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,540
are present in everybody,

275
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,117
it's their ratios that
determine their effects,

276
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:37,580
and so today we're going to talk

277
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,380
about how you can optimize their ratios

278
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,890
depending on your particular life goals

279
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,750
because the ratio of
estrogen and testosterone

280
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,100
in every individual has profound influence

281
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,300
on feelings of well-being,
feelings of optimism,

282
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,570
feelings of anxiety or lack
of anxiety, on reproduction,

283
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,050
on sexual behavior
independent of reproduction,

284
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,260
they are profoundly powerful molecules,

285
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,890
and we all make these molecules,
to some degree or another,

286
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,890
but there are also
important behavioral tools,

287
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,990
supplementation tools,

288
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,440
as well as prescription drugs

289
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,610
that can impact the ratios
of testosterone and estrogen

290
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,220
in really powerful ways,

291
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,350
so we're going to cover all of that.

292
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,070
I want to emphasize that when you hear

293
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,610
sex steroids or steroid hormones,

294
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,250
most people think about anabolic steroids,

295
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,580
and of course, anabolic steroids

296
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,900
are derivatives of testosterone
or testosterone itself,

297
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,240
and they are heavily used and
abused in the sports community

298
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,330
as well as outside the sports community,

299
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,300
but there, of course, are many steroids

300
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,730
that are not anabolic steroids

301
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,260
that are also abused in sports.

302
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,530
Today, we're not talking
about drugs in sports,

303
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,900
but I think that it
carries such a heavy weight

304
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,380
when people hear the word steroids,

305
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,060
they think about anabolic steroids,

306
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,290
so while today's discussion

307
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,330
will certainly be relevant
to physical performance,

308
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,170
in fact, we're going to talk

309
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,580
about how specific types of exercise,

310
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,810
particular patterns of cold exposure,

311
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,880
as well as particular
patterns, believe it or not,

312
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,960
of breathing can impact
sex steroid hormones,

313
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,130
both estrogen and testosterone,

314
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,660
the discussion isn't really geared

315
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,590
towards performance enhancement in sport,

316
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,620
although we will do an entire episode,

317
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,900
perhaps even an entire month

318
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,460
related to performance enhancement
in physical enterprises.

319
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,390
So one of the first things to understand

320
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,560
if you want to optimize your hormones

321
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,340
is where they come from.

322
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,100
There are a lot of
different glands in the body

323
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
that produce hormones,

324
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,980
there's the pineal gland,

325
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,660
some hormones are made
in the hypothalamus,

326
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,650
hormones are made by the gonads,
the ovaries or the testes,

327
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,440
you've got the thyroid gland,

328
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,610
there are a bunch of different glands

329
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,150
that make these different hormones,

330
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,150
but when we're talking about
the sex steroid hormones,

331
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,520
estrogen and testosterone,

332
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,710
the major sources are ovaries for estrogen

333
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,350
and the testes for testosterone,

334
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,120
although the adrenals can
also make testosterone.

335
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,410
Now, there are also some enzymes,

336
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,800
enzymes are things that can
change chemical composition,

337
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,820
and the enzymes that we're
going to talk about today

338
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,920
are the aromatases mainly,

339
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,490
the aromatases convert
testosterone into estrogen,

340
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,350
so in a male, for instance,
that has very high testosterone,

341
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,440
some of that is going to be

342
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,690
converted into estrogen by aromatase,

343
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,790
and aromatase is made by body fat,

344
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,150
it's also made in the testes themselves,

345
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,250
a lot of people don't realize this,

346
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,280
but the testes actually have the capacity

347
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,550
to manufacture estrogen and
aromatase, albeit at low levels,

348
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,260
but this turns out to be important

349
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,960
for optimizing hormone levels
in males at later points,

350
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,350
and we'll discuss that.

351
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,300
It's important to note
that there's a huge range

352
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,150
in terms of the levels of hormones,

353
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,530
testosterone and estrogen,
between individuals,

354
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,080
and it actually occurs within individuals

355
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,140
across the lifespan,

356
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm not going to throw
out specific numbers

357
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,610
of X picograms per
deciliter, et cetera today

358
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,580
because that's going to vary a lot,

359
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,960
it's going to depend on
whether or not you're measuring

360
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,250
in picograms or nanograms
and that sort of thing,

361
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,880
if you want to examine your hormones,

362
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,070
you should do that in conjunction
with a medical doctor,

363
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,680
ideally, an endocrinologist can help you

364
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,190
sort out that information,

365
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,080
but the important thing to know

366
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,700
is that prepubescent females
make very little estrogen,

367
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,720
and when we talk about estrogen,

368
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,360
we mainly talk about estradiol,

369
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,560
which is the most active form of estrogen

370
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,350
in both males and females.

371
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,900
So prepubescent females,
very low levels of estrogen,

372
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,800
during puberty, levels of estrogen,

373
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,770
AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket,

374
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,420
and then across the lifespan,
estrogen is going to vary

375
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,360
depending on the stage
of the menstrual cycle,

376
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,210
but as one heads into menopause,

377
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,130
which typically takes place nowadays

378
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,840
somewhere between age 45 and 60,

379
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,340
levels of estrogen are going to drop

380
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,143
and then post-menopause levels
of estrogen are very low.

381
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,880
As well, testosterone will
fluctuate across the lifespan,

382
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,370
testosterone is going to be
relatively low prepuberty in males,

383
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,920
during puberty, it's going to skyrocket,

384
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
and then the current numbers

385
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,430
are that it drops off at
about a rate of 1% per year,

386
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,010
although we're going
to talk about some data

387
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,160
that show that there's
actually tremendous variation

388
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,450
in testosterone levels,

389
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,640
there's actually a lot of examples

390
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,040
of men in their 90s, their 90s,

391
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,570
who still have testosterone levels

392
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,410
that mimic pubertal levels,

393
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,830
which is remarkable and
speaks to the huge variation

394
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,570
in testosterone levels across individuals.

395
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,960
So let's talk about other
sources of these hormones,

396
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,800
and then it will make clear

397
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,430
what avenues you might want to take

398
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,580
in order to optimize these hormones.

399
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,720
The other glands and tissues in the body

400
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,660
that make these hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,

401
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,900
as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals,

402
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,170
so the adrenals right
on top of the kidneys,

403
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,230
and the release of these steroid
hormones from the adrenals,

404
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,337
in particular testosterone

405
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:45,300
and some of its related derivatives,

406
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,910
are mainly activated by competition,

407
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,940
so let's talk about competition

408
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,520
because it turns out that competition

409
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,000
is a powerful influence on
the sex steroid hormones,

410
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
and the sex steroid hormones

411
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,200
powerfully influence competition.

412
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,780
So most people don't realize this,

413
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,590
but most males of a
given mammalian species

414
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,880
never get to reproduce,

415
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,910
in fact, they never even
get to have sex at all,

416
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,600
and we don't often think about that,

417
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,930
but testosterone plays a powerful role

418
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,380
in determining which
members of a given species

419
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,690
will get to reproduce,

420
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,840
which ones of that species

421
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,310
will actually get access to females,

422
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,640
and so here I'm not talking
about humans specifically,

423
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,200
but it's well known in
species like elephant seals,

424
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,010
in species like antlered
animals and rams, for instance,

425
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,820
that the higher levels of testosterone

426
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,310
correlate with access to females.

427
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,160
Now, one interpretation of
this is that the females

428
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,290
are detecting which males
have high testosterone

429
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,370
and selecting them,

430
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,570
they're more receptive to them,

431
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,890
we're going to talk about
receptivity for mating in a moment,

432
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,750
but it's actually more so that the males

433
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,610
that have higher
testosterone forage further

434
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,089
and will fight harder for the females,

435
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,449
and this is really interesting

436
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,400
because there's very good evidence now

437
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,970
that testosterone can reduce anxiety,

438
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,869
promote novelty-seeking,

439
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:17,289
and promote competitive interactions,

440
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,690
and so before you leap too
far with this in your mind

441
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,633
and think about all these human
behaviors, just stay with me

442
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,589
because there's a little
bit of biology here

443
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,949
that makes it all make sense

444
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,143
and it turns out to be pretty simple.

445
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,150
We have a brain region
called the amygdala,

446
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,580
in Latin, that just means almond,

447
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,130
but the amygdala is most
famous for its role in fear,

448
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,690
we hear a lot about fear and the amygdala,

449
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,660
but that the amygdala

450
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,740
is really involved in threat detection,

451
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,450
it sets our thresholds for anxiety

452
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,020
and what we consider scary or too much,

453
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,590
testosterone secreted from the gonads

454
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,740
and elsewhere in the body
binds to the amygdala

455
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,700
and changes the threshold for stress,

456
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,170
so I've said before on previous
versions of this podcast

457
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,540
and on other podcasts

458
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,230
that testosterone has
this incredible effect

459
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,940
of making effort feel good,

460
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,920
but what I was really
referring to is the fact

461
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,560
that testosterone lowers
stress and anxiety,

462
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,330
in particular, in males
in a given species.

463
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,380
Now, this is important

464
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,340
because we often think of
testosterone as creating,

465
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,930
whatever, masculinization

466
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,510
or it's, you know, virilization,

467
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,230
or all these terms are thrown around,

468
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,300
but what's it really doing

469
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,430
when it comes to mate
choice and competition?

470
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,790
What it's doing is it's reducing
the threshold for anxiety,

471
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,370
and in doing so, it selects individuals

472
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,900
of a given species to push further,

473
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,080
being willing to suffer more,

474
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,370
although it also reduces pain,

475
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,870
so maybe they also suffer less,

476
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,810
in pursuit of reproduction and females.

477
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,640
Now, it's well known in humans
that both males and females

478
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,970
who have elevated levels of testosterone

479
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,120
will engage in more novelty-seeking,

480
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,450
and I do want to point out

481
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,470
that even individuals without
testes have testosterone,

482
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,440
and peaks in testosterone
have similar effects

483
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,226
regardless of whether or not
someone has ovaries or testes,

484
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:10,850
testosterone increases
generally lead to more foraging,

485
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,820
more novelty-seeking, increases in libido,

486
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,270
and increases in desire to mate,

487
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,950
so it is the case that
increases in testosterone

488
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,460
promote competitive and
foraging-type behaviors

489
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,200
in humans and in nonhuman mammals,

490
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,280
but it's also true that competition itself

491
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,970
can increase androgens,
such as testosterone,

492
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,470
I want to repeat that, competitive
environments themselves

493
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,670
can increase testosterone.

494
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,600
Now, some people have
come to the conclusion

495
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,950
that if you win, your
testosterone goes up,

496
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,920
and if you lose, your
testosterone goes down,

497
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,490
and to some extent, that's true,

498
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,590
but that's not a direct
effect on the gonads,

499
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,360
that's actually mediated by
the neuromodulator dopamine,

500
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,370
we talked about dopamine

501
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,730
in the episode on motivation and drive,

502
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,310
and dopamine and testosterone

503
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,180
have a remarkable interplay in the body,

504
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,300
dopamine is actually released in the brain

505
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,480
in ways that has the pituitary,

506
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,760
this gland that sits over
the roof of your mouth,

507
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,900
release certain hormones

508
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,230
that then go on to promote the
release of more testosterone,

509
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,020
and indeed, winning
promotes more dopamine,

510
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,750
and later, more testosterone,

511
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,650
however, in the short term,

512
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,220
just competing increases testosterone

513
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,060
independent of whether
or not you win or lose,

514
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,400
so the short version of this

515
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,190
is that competition
increases testosterone,

516
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,550
and this may be an ancient
mechanism whereby the androgens,

517
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,250
such as testosterone, are feeding back

518
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,430
to encourage more
competitive-type behaviors

519
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,810
because every species,

520
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,260
whether or not you're
talking about reproduction

521
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,090
or other resource allocation,

522
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,670
is involved in competition,

523
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,570
not every individual of a species

524
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,670
gets access to the same number of mates

525
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,520
or the same quality of mates,

526
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,030
and this is true in both directions,

527
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,220
for males and females and
everything in between.

528
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,310
So I just want to emphasize once more

529
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,130
in case I went through it too quickly

530
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,390
that increases in testosterone in females

531
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,610
are also going to lead to
increase in reproductive behavior

532
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,720
or seeking out reproductive
behavior, they increase libido,

533
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,900
in fact, there's a particular
phase of the menstrual cycle

534
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,640
where testosterone peaks
just before ovulation

535
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,640
that, on average, leads
female humans to seek out sex

536
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,920
more than they would
otherwise during their cycle,

537
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,490
and this is all by self-report,

538
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,360
but this is also while measuring

539
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,210
things like testosterone-estrogen
ratios, and so forth,

540
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,490
so it's really interesting
that a single molecule,

541
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,190
regardless of chromosomal
or gonadal background,

542
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,190
is increasing seeking of
mates across individuals,

543
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,900
increasing desire to compete
or willingness to compete,

544
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,240
and lowering the threshold
for stress and anxiety.

545
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,490
It's important to point out

546
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,650
that while increases in testosterone

547
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,660
promote seeking of mates and reproduction

548
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,800
in both males and females,

549
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,140
in females, it's actually
increases in estrogen

550
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,870
that promote receptivity to mating,

551
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,570
so testosterone is
driving the seeking of sex

552
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,170
and estrogen is promoting

553
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,850
the actual act of sex from females,

554
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,900
so-called receptivity,
consensual receptivity.

555
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,800
In males, it's interesting to
point out that testosterone

556
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,140
is promoting seeking of sex,

557
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,830
but it's also estrogen in males
that's important for libido,

558
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,480
if estrogen levels are brought too low,

559
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,610
then men will completely
lose their libido,

560
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,000
this is often not discussed or overlooked

561
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
in the discussion about
testosterone therapy

562
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,340
and performance-enhancing drugs,

563
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,020
people think that
hyperandrogenized individuals,

564
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,510
meaning people that have
very high levels of androgen

565
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,410
will have very high levels
of libido, and they will,

566
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,930
provided estrogen is available

567
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,870
in sufficient ratios to
match that testosterone,

568
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,220
so it's not simply the case

569
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,240
that high levels of testosterone

570
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,220
produce a lot of sex and mating behavior

571
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,500
and low levels of estrogen
are good across the board,

572
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,340
you actually need both in
both males and females,

573
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,880
it's just that in females,
the testosterone levels

574
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,630
are always going to be lower
than the estrogen levels,

575
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,400
and in males, the estrogen levels

576
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,770
are always going to be lower
than testosterone levels,

577
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,340
so testosterone promotes
sex-seeking behavior,

578
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,040
and the real question then is,

579
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,800
does sex itself promote testosterone?

580
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,600
And the answer is somewhat complicated,

581
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,750
but the short version is yes,

582
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,250
and as you recall, sex
has multiple stages,

583
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,210
so there's the physical act of sex,

584
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,610
there's the seeking of sex,

585
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,780
and then there's orgasm and ejaculation.

586
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,800
Now, it's important to
distinguish between these

587
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,610
because whether or not sex
itself increases testosterone

588
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,860
depends on whether or
not the male ejaculates,

589
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,850
and this is very important to understand

590
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,580
because on a previous episode,

591
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,810
I mentioned how dopamine
increases with sexual activity,

592
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,560
remember, dopamine and testosterone

593
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,900
tend to increase linearly
with one another,

594
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,690
but then after ejaculation,
there's a release of prolactin,

595
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,770
and prolactin actually sets
the refractory period in males

596
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,290
during which he can't have sex again,

597
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,190
and the duration of the refractory period

598
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,320
will vary tremendously depending
on how much and how long

599
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,300
that prolactin release occurs.

600
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,400
I also described in a previous episode

601
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,010
how some people take vitamin B6,

602
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,927
I'm not suggesting anyone do this,

603
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:21,550
but take vitamin B6 in order
to reduce prolactin levels

604
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,680
and thereby reduce the duration
of the refractory period,

605
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,050
but getting at this question

606
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,740
about testosterone and sexual behavior,

607
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,860
it's important to distinguish

608
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,770
between these different
phases of reproduction

609
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,680
or reproductive behaviors,

610
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,680
so there are studies showing
that sexual behavior itself

611
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,100
can increase testosterone,

612
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,970
there was a study published in 2011

613
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,110
from Escasa et al., E-S-C-A-S-A,

614
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,310
this is the stuff of
textbooks, this is on PubMed,

615
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,910
these are quality studies,

616
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,020
showing that men who observe sex,

617
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,950
so I guess this would be
observing pornography,

618
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,740
will have slight increases in testosterone

619
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,120
during the observation,

620
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,910
these people actually were
willing to have blood draws taken

621
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,780
while watching pornography,

622
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,750
they had increases in testosterone
that were very modest,

623
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,670
of about 10%,

624
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,550
whereas when people participated in sex,

625
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,720
so they actually did this study
where people had blood draws

626
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,370
and they had real sex with their partners,

627
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,280
and they had 70%
increases in testosterone,

628
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,430
so there are increases in testosterone

629
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,350
that are quite significant

630
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,060
during the physical act of sex

631
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,520
and far less so during observing sex.

632
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,300
Now, the question that I often get,

633
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,210
in fact, it's one of the
questions I get most often

634
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,420
in the comments on YouTube,

635
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,710
I don't know why that is,

636
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,710
is whether or not ejaculation
adjusts testosterone levels,

637
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,180
and it turns out, there are
two studies that I could find

638
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,040
that were quality studies
on PubMed that address this,

639
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,240
that sex and ejaculation itself

640
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,830
does not reduce testosterone levels

641
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,380
although it will increase prolactin levels

642
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,440
for the reasons I described a moment ago,

643
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,440
however, abstinence or
sex without ejaculation

644
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,220
for a week or more

645
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,480
will increase testosterone
levels up to 400%,

646
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,930
so the answer is actually complicated,

647
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,490
it's not straightforward,

648
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,640
what it means is that sex
itself increases testosterone,

649
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
however, abstinence also
increases testosterone

650
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,600
even further,

651
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,710
so it's a nuanced answer,

652
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,590
and I hope this is
satisfactory, no pun intended,

653
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,600
to those of you that have been asking me,

654
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,070
what is the relationship
between sex and ejaculation

655
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,770
and testosterone and dopamine?

656
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,410
It is nuanced, and you have
to understand that nuance

657
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,810
if you want to understand

658
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,900
how certain behaviors impact hormones

659
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,190
and how hormones impact those behaviors.

660
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,120
As I mentioned before, in females,

661
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,030
testosterone also primes the
motivation to seek out sex,

662
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,930
and sex itself also
increases testosterone,

663
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,080
but it also increases prolactin,

664
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,690
so in both men and women,

665
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,650
sex increases prolactin post-sex,

666
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,380
it's just the way that the system works,

667
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,610
it's that testosterone
and dopamine increase

668
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,200
in the seeking-out and
the behavior of sex,

669
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,950
and then after sex,
prolactin levels go up,

670
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,130
there's kind of a quiescence,

671
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,250
the whole nervous system
is promoted towards calm,

672
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,480
and this may actually have
something to do with pair-bonding

673
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,820
and the encouragement of individuals

674
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,910
to spend more time together

675
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,810
to exchange different smells and hormones,

676
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,920
and maybe even pheromones,

677
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
and we're going to talk
about pheromones in a moment.

678
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,930
A few years ago, there
was a lot of excitement

679
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,840
about the hormone DHEA,

680
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,021
which is mainly made by the adrenals,

681
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:40,300
DHEA has been promoted
as kind of a catch-all

682
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,640
for increasing testosterone and estrogen

683
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,620
in males and females,

684
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,300
and indeed, DHEA will increase

685
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,170
both testosterone and estrogen,

686
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,740
this is something to be mindful of

687
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,420
if you're thinking about taking DHEA

688
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,666
or you're taking DHEA already.

689
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,840
DHEA will increase both
testosterone and estrogen,

690
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,820
and the extent to which it
increases one or the other

691
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,760
will depend on whether or
not you're starting off

692
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,690
with more estrogen than testosterone

693
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,570
or whether or not you're starting off

694
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,100
with more testosterone than estrogen

695
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,400
and whether or not you
have a lot of aromatase,

696
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,420
so for individuals that
have a lot of aromatase

697
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,760
being made by the testes or by body fat,

698
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,610
if you take DHEA, there's a good chance

699
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,500
that a fair portion of that

700
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,070
is going to be shuttled
towards estrogen production

701
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,440
and not towards testosterone production,

702
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,860
whereas in individuals that have

703
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,690
low levels of testosterone to begin with,

704
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,960
high levels of estrogen,

705
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,270
there's a good chance that the DHEA

706
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,370
is going to promote mainly
estrogen production,

707
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,910
at least that's what I could find

708
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,110
from the research studies that I examined.

709
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,580
So the way to think about DHEA,

710
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,570
it's a kind of global promoter
of the sex steroid hormones,

711
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,670
and its specific effects
are going to depend

712
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,100
a little bit on where you started

713
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,240
and whether or not you
have ovaries or testes.

714
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,500
So just as there are behaviors

715
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,620
that can increase testosterone,

716
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,890
there are behaviors that
can decrease testosterone,

717
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,630
and one of the most
well-characterized ones in humans

718
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,360
is becoming a parent.

719
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,360
So expecting fathers have
an almost 50% decrease

720
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,053
in testosterone levels, both
free and bound testosterone,

721
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,220
as well, their cortisol
levels, a stress hormone,

722
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,670
drop by almost three-fold,
which is incredible,

723
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,360
and their estradiol levels double,

724
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,230
so their estrogen levels double,

725
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,210
so expecting fathers
many people have known

726
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,910
put on additional body weight,

727
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,960
everyone always thought that
it's because they're eating

728
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,410
in parallel with their pregnant wife,

729
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,770
but it turns out that these
effects of reduced testosterone,

730
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,130
increased estradiol, and reduced cortisol

731
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,910
can all be explained by
an increase in prolactin,

732
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,050
so not just in humans, but
in other species as well,

733
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,780
when the male and female of that species

734
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,680
are expecting young,

735
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,420
they lay down more body fat,

736
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,170
the assumption is that this is to prepare

737
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,250
for long nights of no sleep,

738
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,510
which occurs in many
species, not just in humans,

739
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,860
so it's really interesting
that this hormone, prolactin,

740
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,680
can start suppressing whole
categories of hormones,

741
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,830
sex steroid hormones,

742
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,080
and can start increasing whole
categories of other ones,

743
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,630
so we hear about the dad bod,

744
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,220
there are a lot of
explanations for the dad bod

745
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,630
that extend well beyond
this podcast episode,

746
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,220
but it is a well-known phenomenon

747
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,890
that testosterone is going to drop,

748
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,030
prolactin's going to increase,

749
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,940
estradiol's going to
increase in males and females

750
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,970
that are expecting children.

751
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,550
Now, how long that lasts
is very interesting,

752
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,860
it actually has to do
with how much contact

753
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,210
and how much contact with smells

754
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,030
of the baby, of the offspring,

755
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,430
the father happens to have,

756
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,910
so how available or unavailable he is

757
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,920
will actually impact
his level of hormones,

758
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,730
now, I'm definitely not promoting the idea

759
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,040
that fathers or mothers take
time away from their offspring

760
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,940
in order to keep their
testosterone levels high

761
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,250
or to restore them,

762
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,700
that's not what I'm saying at all,

763
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,070
it's just interesting to point out

764
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,730
that these evolutionary
mechanisms push us toward

765
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,400
or bias us toward particular
categories of behaviors

766
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,980
by influencing our hormones,

767
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,070
which then feed back

768
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,190
and promote more of
that particular behavior

769
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,940
because as I mentioned before,

770
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,710
peaks in testosterone in males and females

771
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,330
cause individuals to seek
sex, not promote parenting,

772
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,720
whereas reductions in testosterone,

773
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,080
increases in prolactin,
and decreases in cortisol

774
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,810
move individuals of both sexes
toward parenting behavior

775
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,820
and less toward reproductive behavior.

776
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,470
The other behavior that
markedly reduces testosterone

777
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,000
in both males and females

778
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,160
and markedly reduces the desire

779
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,270
for seeking sex and sex itself is illness,

780
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,697
and many of you might say,

781
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:38,557
"Well, duh, when people feel sick,

782
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:40,097
"they don't feel like seeking out mates,

783
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:41,670
"they don't feel like having sex,"

784
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,180
but have you ever wondered
why that actually is?

785
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,610
Well, it turns out that
it can be explained

786
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,800
by the release of what are
called inflammatory cytokines,

787
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,340
so cytokines are related
to the immune system,

788
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,280
they travel in the lymph and in the blood,

789
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,990
and they attack invader cells
like bacteria and viruses,

790
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,970
and under conditions of illness,

791
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,720
we make a lot of different cytokines,

792
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,710
some of them are anti-inflammatory,

793
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,800
but some of them are pro-inflammatory,

794
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,430
and the best-known example

795
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,950
of a pro-inflammatory cytokine is IL-6,

796
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,270
and it's known that IL-6, when
injected into individuals,

797
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,770
will decrease the desire for sex

798
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,090
and eventually will reduce

799
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,630
levels of testosterone and estrogen

800
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,660
independent of feeling lousy,

801
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,770
so the reason why people don't
want sex when they're sick

802
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,080
is because levels of IL-6 are increased.

803
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,110
Now, this is important

804
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,360
because as we start to think
about the different ways

805
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,540
to modulate the sex steroid hormones,

806
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,283
so-called optimize the hormones,

807
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,860
keeping levels of IL-6 low

808
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,130
is going to be important for
them to exert their effects,

809
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,510
now, IL-6 doesn't just
travel to the gonads

810
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,360
and shut down the gonads,

811
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,190
it actually has ways to interact
with some of the receptors

812
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,390
that the steroid hormones,

813
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,500
estrogen and testosterone, bind to,

814
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,890
and impact those receptors

815
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,650
so that the sex steroid hormones
can't have their effect.

816
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,690
In short and put simply,

817
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,930
inflammatory cytokines like IL-6

818
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,790
are bad for sex steroid hormones,

819
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,240
and so we're going to talk
about how to modulate IL-6

820
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,030
in the direction that you would want

821
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,340
and how to increase another
cytokine called IL-10,

822
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,090
which is anti-inflammatory

823
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,660
in ways that can help
promote, or at least support,

824
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,220
the sex steroid hormones.

825
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,400
So as we move forward,

826
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,230
we're going to now start to consider

827
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,460
what sorts of behavioral practices,

828
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,080
as well as other things,

829
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,180
can modulate the sex steroid hormones

830
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,383
in the directions that
you want them to go,

831
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,780
but before we do that,

832
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,480
and in order to set the stage for that,

833
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,230
you should be asking yourself,

834
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,130
how is it, or why is it,
at a mechanistic level,

835
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,090
that behaviors can
modulate hormones at all?

836
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,140
If you think about it,
it's kind of strange

837
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,510
that just the mere act of
being a parent or parenting

838
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,030
can change testosterone
levels so dramatically

839
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,120
or estradiol levels so
dramatically, what is it?

840
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,880
Is it the sweat of the baby?

841
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,390
Is it their saliva?

842
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,750
Is it the sight of the baby?

843
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,730
Is it holding the baby,
or is it all those things?

844
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,100
It turns out that many of those effects

845
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,820
are because of smell,

846
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,070
or in some cases, even
possibly pheromones.

847
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,280
Now, I talked about hormones,

848
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,520
hormones, again, are a
chemical, travels in the body,

849
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,080
impacts tissues and cells
elsewhere in the body,

850
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,210
a pheromone is a chemical that's released

851
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,750
by one member of a species

852
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,110
that goes and impacts members elsewhere,

853
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,960
but of the same species,
or even of other species.

854
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,820
Now, pheromone effects are
absolutely well-established

855
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,389
in lots of animal species,

856
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,799
but they are very controversial in humans.

857
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,880
Today, I'm going to talk

858
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,429
about some of the
well-established ones in animals,

859
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,419
I've mentioned one or two of these before

860
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,800
on previous podcasts,

861
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,449
but I haven't mentioned several of them,

862
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,459
and I'm going to talk about the evidence

863
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,780
for pheromones in humans
that are well-established.

864
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,770
So the main ones in
animals that are discussed

865
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,870
are called the Lee-Boot
effect, the Whitten effect,

866
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,480
the Bruce effect, and
the Vandenbergh effect,

867
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,680
named after the people
that discovered them.

868
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,940
The Lee-Boot effect is when

869
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,390
you house females of a given
species together with no males,

870
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,360
they start displaying longer,
what are called estrus cycles,

871
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,730
in many species, they don't
have menstrual cycles,

872
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,870
which are 28 days,

873
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,730
they have estrus cycles
which tend to be four days

874
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,123
or some variant thereof.

875
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,190
It's an interesting phenomenon
because what it means

876
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,530
is that the presence of the male itself

877
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,170
is changing the ovulation cycle.

878
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,520
Now, many people out there,

879
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,250
I imagine mostly the people
that are ovulating out there

880
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,447
will say, "Of course, I
notice I ovulate differently,

881
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:38,357
"or my cycle changes when I'm
in the presence of my partner

882
00:35:38,357 --> 00:35:39,420
"or I'm not,"

883
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,610
but the pheromone effect

884
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,840
that mirrors this
Lee-Boot effect in humans

885
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,460
has still not really been identified,

886
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,360
nobody knows what the exact chemical is,

887
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,270
but nonetheless, this is a
strong effect in some animals.

888
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,340
The other one is the Bruce effect,

889
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,830
and this is a very dramatic effect

890
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,830
whereby a pregnant animal will
abort or reabsorb her fetus

891
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,360
if the dad of those animals,

892
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,840
the father that sired the litter,

893
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,410
because these are
animals, they're litters,

894
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,410
is removed and a novel male
is placed in her vicinity

895
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,840
for about 48 hours,

896
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,550
and what's interesting is
the way that this happens

897
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,830
is a pheromone that comes from male urine

898
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,870
activates the gonadotropin-releasing
hormone system

899
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,550
and causes a reintroduction
of the estrus cycle

900
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,960
and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus.

901
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,270
Now, a lot of people have
taken the Bruce effect

902
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,500
kind of to its extreme

903
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,770
and asked whether or not in humans,

904
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,730
miscarriages are caused by
detecting the pheromones

905
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,000
or odors of novel males,
meaning the non-dad male,

906
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,630
and that's still an open question,

907
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,360
nobody knows if that's true or not,

908
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,660
so I want to emphasize that.

909
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,120
The other one is the Vandenbergh effect,

910
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,160
and this is one I alluded to

911
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,780
in a previous episode of the podcast,

912
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,460
which is that puberty in
females can be accelerated

913
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,300
by placing a novel sexually competent male

914
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,460
in with a young female who
has not undergone puberty.

915
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,660
There's also a version of this,
which I haven't described,

916
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,520
which is delay of puberty

917
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,270
where you take juvenile female animals

918
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,100
that have not undergone puberty

919
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,830
and you put them with more mature females

920
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,830
of the same species,

921
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,710
and that introduction of more
females will cause a delay,

922
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,270
a significant delay in
the onset of puberty.

923
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,900
So these are all pheromone effects,

924
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,380
and we know they're pheromone effects

925
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,500
because they're not conscious,

926
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,090
they also don't require actual contact

927
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,730
with the other members of a given species,

928
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,460
these are all effects that can be mediated

929
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,240
by the urine from a given species

930
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,260
or by the sweat of a given species,

931
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,360
and speaking of sweat,
the one pheromone effect

932
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,620
that I'm very aware of from
the published literature

933
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,970
is a paper that was published in 1998

934
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,770
by Stern and McClintock

935
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,930
which was getting at this question

936
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,700
of synchronization of menstrual cycles.

937
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,390
Now, the whole idea of
synchronization of menstrual cycles

938
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,350
is pretty controversial,

939
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,507
for a long time, people said,

940
00:38:02,507 --> 00:38:06,050
"Oh, this is absolutely a
well-characterized phenomenon,"

941
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,130
people in dormitories,

942
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,010
their menstrual cycles would synchronize,

943
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,900
people living in environments together,

944
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,470
their menstrual cycles would synchronize,

945
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,070
and then some studies came out

946
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,550
that kind of undercut those data

947
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,360
and said no, this actually doesn't happen,

948
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,840
and it was kind of controversial,

949
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,430
but there is a very clear effect

950
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,770
that was described by
Stern and McClintock,

951
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,470
what they did actually
was they took females,

952
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,520
they charted their cycles,

953
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,520
and then they had other females
wear pads in their armpits

954
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,850
and they collected sweat
from those females,

955
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,640
and then they took the
sweat from those pads

956
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,210
in those female's armpits,

957
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,540
and they introduced them to women

958
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,640
who had never had contact with
the people who had sweated,

959
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,230
they only had contact with their sweat,

960
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,987
in fact, they swabbed it
underneath their nose,

961
00:38:53,987 --> 00:38:57,650
and if that sounds gross,
they dilute it in alcohol,

962
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,630
so much so that they can't actually detect

963
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,180
the odor of the sweat,

964
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,790
that's actually very important
because it's not the smell,

965
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,590
it's the pheromone chemical itself,

966
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,670
and it turns out the
pheromone chemical itself

967
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,450
can modulate the menstrual cycle,

968
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,830
although it doesn't
necessarily synchronize it

969
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,280
with the sweater,

970
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,820
what it does is it changes

971
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,390
the duration and the pattern of ovulation

972
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,750
relative to the so-called
follicular phase,

973
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,920
long and short of this

974
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,410
is that the sweat and
pheromones of females

975
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,110
can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns

976
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,830
of other adult females,

977
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,220
it's just a question of whether
or not they synchronize,

978
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,670
and if you're kind of
rolling your eyes now

979
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,033
and saying, "Well, of course they do,

980
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,300
"and this is really detailed,"

981
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,140
this is how the science is done,

982
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,720
and the reason why people are so skeptical

983
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,650
about the presence of
pheromone effects in humans

984
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,620
is that there's no
well-identified pheromone organ,

985
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,910
you know, we have an area of our nose

986
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,200
that's responsible for smelling,
that's well-established,

987
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,560
it's been observed in
MRIs many, many times,

988
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,920
in cadavers many, many times,

989
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,750
in pretty much all individuals,

990
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,010
but the vomeronasal organ,

991
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,740
which is the pheromone-detecting organ,

992
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,640
hasn't really been found in humans,

993
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,250
there's something called Jacobson's organ,

994
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,660
which is thought to be
the organ in the nose,

995
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,060
it's actually on the top
of the roof of the mouth

996
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,660
and in the kind of back of the nose,

997
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,580
this is for you wine tasters,

998
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,660
I never can pronounce this,

999
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,620
what are they called,
sommelier, whatevers,

1000
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,430
the people that are excellent at drinking

1001
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,500
and detecting the essences of wine

1002
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,830
that you have to go
through all these tests

1003
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,840
in order to get certified as one of them,

1004
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,743
somebody tell me,

1005
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,200
they are using probably
a similar mechanism

1006
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,840
of mixing taste and smell,

1007
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,940
and Jacobson's organ, if it exists,

1008
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,990
the vomeronasal equivalent in humans,

1009
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,320
is thought to be a combination
of smell and taste.

1010
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,760
Now, it gets even weirder and cooler

1011
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,430
when you think about a given
study that was done in humans

1012
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,430
where if you take hundreds
of t-shirts from boyfriends,

1013
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,810
keep them separate,

1014
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,210
you take those t-shirts,

1015
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,940
you wash them many times separately,

1016
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,680
and then you offer them
to the girlfriends,

1017
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,950
the long-time partners of those guys,

1018
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,840
and what you'll find
is that the girlfriend

1019
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,610
can pick out her boyfriend's t-shirt

1020
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,260
among hundreds of other t-shirts,

1021
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,770
not because it smells different,

1022
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,370
but because something
about it seems different,

1023
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,500
it might smell different to her

1024
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,530
in some way that's kind of
imperceptible even to her,

1025
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,450
and the level of accuracy
in detecting that t-shirt,

1026
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,560
her partner's t-shirt,

1027
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,150
is way above statistical
significant thresholds,

1028
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,050
so much so that you almost have to say

1029
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,780
there's something about these effects

1030
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,800
that are real pheromone effects,

1031
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,020
although people still argue

1032
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,610
that there are no pheromone
effects in humans,

1033
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,130
that it's all through olfaction,

1034
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,613
I think these are interesting
and important to understand

1035
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,310
because it means that a lot of things

1036
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,540
coming through our nose,

1037
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,830
whether or not it's pheromones or smells,

1038
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,540
are impacting hormones and
our ability to attach memories

1039
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,320
and kind of recognition
of mates and other people,

1040
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,440
including our children,
not just our mates,

1041
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,450
and of course, perfume manufacturers

1042
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,600
have really picked up on
the idea of pheromones

1043
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,950
and have entire laboratories set up

1044
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,670
to build chemical compounds into perfumes

1045
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,400
that are designed to attract other mates,

1046
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,870
this is a well-established and
well-documented phenomenon.

1047
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,210
And the last point I'll
make about pheromones

1048
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,260
is that this combination
of taste and smell

1049
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,290
is such a real thing in the animal world

1050
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,080
that there's something
called the flehmen response,

1051
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,520
during the mating seasons
for different animals,

1052
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,110
you can actually even see this in horses,

1053
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,020
but for animals that are seasonal maters,

1054
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,810
they'll do something
called the flehmen response

1055
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,690
where they actually open
their lips and their mouth

1056
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,870
and they expose their gums

1057
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,890
so that they can capture pheromones

1058
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,490
that are floating in the
wind in the environment,

1059
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,170
they actually are looking for mates

1060
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,260
using their mouth and
kind of sniffing around.

1061
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,093
If you own a dog

1062
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:55,150
and you watch the way that
the dog will sniff around

1063
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,850
selecting where they want to
urinate, males and females,

1064
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,040
they're bringing
molecules into their nose,

1065
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,710
I know it sounds kind of
gross, sniffing urine,

1066
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,160
but there are a lot of
pheromones in urine of animals,

1067
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,740
a lot of pheromones that
are traveling in the wind,

1068
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,700
again, whether or not this
is happening in humans,

1069
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,970
I don't know, but then you
think about the perfume thing,

1070
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,760
and here people are putting
these scents on themselves

1071
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,340
that contain putative
pheromones, human pheromones,

1072
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,040
and walking around
hoping that their scents

1073
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,190
are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior

1074
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,930
from other individuals of
the same human species,

1075
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:30,090
so we are among the
animals in this behavior,

1076
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,500
independent of whether or not you believe

1077
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,900
pheromone effects exist.

1078
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,510
So let's get back to behaviors

1079
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,703
that can help optimize hormone levels.

1080
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,810
One of the main behaviors
that's been shown

1081
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:45,730
to be associated with
poor levels of estrogen

1082
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,020
relative to age-match controls
for people with ovaries

1083
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,750
or lower levels of testosterone

1084
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,960
compared to age-match controls

1085
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,063
for people with testes, is apnea,

1086
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,020
apnea has everything to
do with under-breathing

1087
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,320
and the buildup of too much
carbon dioxide in the body,

1088
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,930
there are other effects of apnea as well,

1089
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,590
but if there's a consistent
literature in this whole story

1090
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,980
about aging and reductions in hormones

1091
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,560
and general health and reductions
in hormones, it's apnea.

1092
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,860
I went deep into the literature
on advanced menopause,

1093
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,460
or when menopausal
symptoms are exacerbated,

1094
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,860
and I went into the
literature on andropause,

1095
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,810
or early-onset andropause,

1096
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,500
or levels of testosterone

1097
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,850
that are far lower than they
should be for a given age,

1098
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:41,090
and in every case, you
could find multiple papers

1099
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,830
that show that apnea, or
poor efficiency of breathing

1100
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,920
and buildup of too much
carbon dioxide in the body

1101
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,753
was a problem,

1102
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,920
mostly sleep apnea,

1103
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,880
although apnea in general
was shown to be an issue

1104
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,840
negatively impacting hormones.

1105
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,620
Now, the directionality of this
effect isn't entirely clear,

1106
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,420
it could be that reductions
in estrogen cause apnea,

1107
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,810
and actually, there's some reason

1108
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,070
to believe that might be the case,

1109
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,080
I found at least one paper

1110
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,130
showing that there are estrogen receptors

1111
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,790
on some of the neurons that
actually innervate the lungs

1112
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,350
and allow for the perception

1113
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,470
of how full or empty the lungs are,

1114
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,370
in other words, reductions in
estrogen may adjust breathing

1115
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,880
by changing our sensitivity
to our own lungs,

1116
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
now, that was true for males and females,

1117
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,930
remember, estrogen is
both males and females,

1118
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,570
but as well, I found papers in
which testosterone reductions

1119
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,150
were associated with apnea,

1120
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,240
and testosterone receptors are also found

1121
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,900
on a lot of cells in
the so-called viscera,

1122
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,340
including the lungs,

1123
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,200
so again, the directionality
of the effect isn't clear,

1124
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,540
but what's really interesting

1125
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,610
is that there are very clear ways

1126
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,350
in which patterns of breathing,

1127
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,620
especially patterns of breathing in sleep,

1128
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,380
can modulate hormones

1129
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,590
in ways that are immediately actionable

1130
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,820
and can serve to optimize
both estrogen and testosterone

1131
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,610
regardless of whether or not
you have ovaries or testes.

1132
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,090
So what is apnea?

1133
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,830
Apnea is under-breathing,

1134
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:13,360
or mainly, cessation of
breathing during sleep,

1135
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,610
so people are holding their breath,

1136
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,532
and then they'll suddenly wake up,

1137
00:46:16,532 --> 00:46:18,730
and actually I've talked
about the physiological sigh

1138
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,920
on previous episodes of this podcast,

1139
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,230
of this pattern of double
inhales followed by exhales

1140
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,060
that one can do consciously
to reduce stress and anxiety

1141
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,830
and offload carbon dioxide,

1142
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,970
that pattern of breathing

1143
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,380
is actually what kicks in spontaneously

1144
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,210
anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep,

1145
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,910
although in many people who have apnea,

1146
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,640
they don't engage the physiological sigh.

1147
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,850
People who are dramatically overweight

1148
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,560
also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep,

1149
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,790
there's actually a lot of buildup

1150
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,410
of carbon dioxide in the body,

1151
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,580
and that can lead to excessive
sleepiness during the day,

1152
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,240
inability to access the
deeper phases of sleep,

1153
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,090
and it's well-established
that going into deep sleep

1154
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,350
and getting the proper patterns

1155
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,740
of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep

1156
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,200
are important for hormone optimization.

1157
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,760
I talked about how to modulate
sleep and optimize sleep

1158
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,700
in the first month of the
"Huberman Lab Podcast,"

1159
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,440
so please check out those
episodes if you have sleep issues

1160
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,920
or you want to work on your sleep,

1161
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,080
also check out Matt Walker's
terrific book, "Why We Sleep,"

1162
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,170
and that will help you
find various protocols

1163
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,250
to help you optimize your sleep,

1164
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,350
but the issue of breathing itself

1165
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,370
can be adjusted in the
daytime waking hours

1166
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,170
in ways that can powerfully
impact both sleep,

1167
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,380
reduce incidents of sleep apnea,

1168
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,640
and apparently from some
emerging literature,

1169
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,550
can also help to optimize various hormones

1170
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,520
even just by breathing in
particular ways while awake.

1171
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,803
So here's how this works,

1172
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,250
there's now a lot of literature

1173
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,970
showing that breathing through the nose,

1174
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:48,960
not through the mouth,

1175
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,010
is powerful for improving lots of things,

1176
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:54,590
first of all, it improves
cosmetic features

1177
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,530
of the jaw and face,

1178
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,110
this was first well-established
by my colleagues at Stanford

1179
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,490
in a book called "Jaws: The
Story of a Hidden Epidemic,"

1180
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,740
this is by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich,

1181
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,730
who are both faculty at Stanford,

1182
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,220
has a forward by Robert Sapolsky,
the great Robert Sapolsky,

1183
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,720
and it also has a heavy
endorsement upfront

1184
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,550
by Jared Diamond, the author
of "Guns, Germs, and Steel,"

1185
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,530
the Pulitzer winner,

1186
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,500
so a lot of heavy hitters
on this book, "Jaws."

1187
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,270
It's not a book that a lot of people

1188
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,260
know about, unfortunately,

1189
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,040
but it really describes the
benefits of nasal breathing

1190
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,670
and the terrible things
that happen when people,

1191
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,490
in particular children, but adults also,

1192
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,290
are heavy mouth-breathers,

1193
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,070
so mouth-breathers have changes

1194
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,010
in the cosmetics of their face and jaw

1195
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,600
that are really bad in
terms of attractiveness,

1196
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,950
and this was done in twin studies,

1197
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,280
you can look in the book
and see some of this,

1198
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,220
it's really dramatic how
being a mouth-breather

1199
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,570
tends to make the chin drop
back behind the upper mandible,

1200
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,870
there's a lengthening in the
face, a drooping of the eyes,

1201
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,500
it can be quite dramatic or modest

1202
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,440
depending on how much mouth-breathing.

1203
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,240
Now, sometimes we have to
breathe with our mouths,

1204
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,460
but there's also a lot of data and studies

1205
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,330
described in this book, "Jaws,"

1206
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:06,330
that describe how nose-breathing
in wakefulness and in sleep

1207
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,830
promotes all sorts of positive things

1208
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,530
related to not just cosmetics,

1209
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,610
but also the improvement of gas exchange

1210
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,160
of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body,

1211
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,300
and as well, it can modify levels

1212
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,620
of different neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators

1213
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,690
in ways that positively
can impact hormones,

1214
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,810
so believe it or not,
being a nasal-breather

1215
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,550
and avoiding being a mouth-breather

1216
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,440
can actually positively impact hormones,

1217
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,510
and in particular, the hormones
testosterone and estrogen,

1218
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,720
although the way that it does that

1219
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,320
is by making you a better sleeper,

1220
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,970
which allows you to
produce more testosterone

1221
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,343
and the appropriate amounts
of testosterone and estrogen,

1222
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,240
but it does that in part
through indirect mechanisms

1223
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,210
because deep sleep supports the gonads,

1224
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,910
the ovaries and the testicles

1225
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:58,640
and their turnover of cells
and the production of cells,

1226
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,400
remember, in the ovary, particular cells

1227
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,800
and the egg follicles
themselves make estrogen,

1228
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,620
and in the testicle,

1229
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,270
that the sertoli cells
and the Leydig cells

1230
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,410
are important for the formation of sperm

1231
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,400
and for testosterone, respectively.

1232
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,660
So what does this all mean?

1233
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,110
This means we have to
be breathing properly,

1234
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,330
it almost sounds kind of
like, kind of new-agey,

1235
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,600
like, oh, you have to breathe properly

1236
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,530
to get your hormones right,

1237
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,550
but no, you have to breathe properly

1238
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,140
to get your breathing and sleep right

1239
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,160
so that your sleep can
actually be deep enough

1240
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,310
and you're not entering apnea states,

1241
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,210
and then that will support gonad function,

1242
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,840
and I wouldn't be putting this out

1243
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,480
as one of the main
behavioral tools upfront

1244
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,510
if it weren't for the fact

1245
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,820
that the effects of
apnea on these hormones

1246
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,860
are dramatic and terrible,

1247
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,200
and the positive effects
of getting breathing right

1248
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,120
on these hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,

1249
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,920
are dramatic and wonderful,

1250
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,880
so let's talk about a few
of those studies briefly

1251
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,160
so I can underscore the
value of proper breathing

1252
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,030
in order to optimize hormones.

1253
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,230
So I was able to find at
least four quality studies

1254
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:06,030
showing that when apnea is
reduced in sleep, or eliminated,

1255
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,900
there are significant increases
in testosterone in males

1256
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,930
and in proper estrogen to
testosterone ratios in females,

1257
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,030
and the way that it works
is very interesting,

1258
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,290
apparently, it works by
reductions in cortisol,

1259
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,930
now, cortisol is a stress hormone

1260
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,030
that is released early
in the day as we wake up

1261
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,940
and serves healthy roles in
protecting us against infection,

1262
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,910
reducing inflammation, et cetera,

1263
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:31,870
but you don't want
cortisol to be too high,

1264
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,130
and you certainly don't
want it elevated too long

1265
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,140
throughout the day and night,

1266
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,070
and so we all know,

1267
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,180
because now we've been told a
lot in the last decade or so,

1268
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,020
that getting proper sleep is important

1269
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,260
for all these aspects of health,

1270
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,790
getting proper sleep can really offset

1271
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,930
all the reductions in
testosterone and estrogen

1272
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,750
and reductions in fertility that occur

1273
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,060
if we don't get enough sleep,

1274
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,530
but seldom is it discussed how sleep

1275
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,730
actually adjusts things like
testosterone and estrogen,

1276
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,030
and it does it by modifying cortisol,

1277
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,130
so the molecule cholesterol

1278
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:06,960
can be converted into
testosterone or estrogen,

1279
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,040
but there's a competition

1280
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,530
whereby the cholesterol
will turn into cortisol

1281
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,970
and not testosterone,

1282
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,730
or it'll turn into
cortisol and not estrogen

1283
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,690
if stress levels are too high,

1284
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,240
so the simple version of this

1285
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,680
is getting your breathing
right during the waking hours,

1286
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,880
meaning primarily, unless
you're working out really hard

1287
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,930
or there's some other reason why,

1288
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,940
you're maybe eating or speaking,

1289
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,120
that you need to be
breathing through your mouth,

1290
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,640
you should be a nose-breather,

1291
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,110
there's really good evidence for that now,

1292
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:39,020
and in sleep, you also
want to be a nose-breather

1293
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,660
because that's going to
increase the amount of oxygen

1294
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,493
that you're bringing into your system

1295
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,490
and the amount of carbon
dioxide that you're offloading,

1296
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,330
there are other positive
effects of it as well,

1297
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,450
but you're basically reducing apnea,

1298
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,130
breath-holding in sleep leads
to buildup of carbon dioxide

1299
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,060
and leads to increases in cortisol,

1300
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,030
which then decrease testosterone
and decrease estrogen

1301
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,370
in negative ways across all sexes, okay?

1302
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,030
So the simple version of this
is get your breathing right,

1303
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:05,850
so how do you do that, how do
you get your breathing right?

1304
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,840
Well, for some people that
have severe sleep apnea,

1305
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,620
they are going to need the CPAP machine,

1306
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,300
this is a machine that you
actually put on your face

1307
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,620
and it helps you breathe
properly in sleep.

1308
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,780
Many people, however, are
starting to do this thing

1309
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,870
of taping their mouths shut,

1310
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,050
now, this sounds a little bit extreme,

1311
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,600
and you certainly don't want to do this

1312
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,670
in any way that's dangerous.

1313
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,387
James Nestor talked
about this in his book,

1314
00:53:25,387 --> 00:53:27,510
"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,"

1315
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,550
that simply taping shut the mouth,

1316
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,310
with some tape that will allow you

1317
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,000
to open your mouth if you really need to,

1318
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,090
during sleep can allow
people to shift over

1319
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:40,580
from being mouth-breathers
and snorers to nose-breathers.

1320
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,460
In the daytime, the best way
to get good at nasal-breathing

1321
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,200
is to dilate the nasal passages,

1322
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,550
'cause a lot of people have a hard time

1323
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,330
breathing through their nose,

1324
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,600
and one way to do this

1325
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,177
is to just breathe through your nose more,

1326
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:54,700
and one way to do that
is when you exercise,

1327
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,860
in particular, cardiovascular exercise,

1328
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,600
most of the time, provided
you're not in maximum effort,

1329
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,300
you should be nasal-breathing.

1330
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,870
Now, for a lot of people,

1331
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,460
nasal-breathing during
exercise is hard at first,

1332
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,470
but as you do it,

1333
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:10,360
because the sinuses have a
capacity to dilate over time,

1334
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,930
you'll get better at it,

1335
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:15,940
the sinuses, if you haven't
ever held a skull for,

1336
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,660
because of my job as a neuroscientist,

1337
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,670
I've held a lot of skulls,

1338
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,190
taken a lot of brains
out of a lot of skulls,

1339
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,210
I teach neuroanatomy,
and I've done that for,

1340
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,650
goodness, god knows how many species

1341
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,210
I've done that for, including human,

1342
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,170
but what the sinuses
are is they're actually,

1343
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,480
what you've got are you
got these little portals

1344
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,680
in the bone that run, you
know, up here and down here,

1345
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,830
behind the nose and into the jaw,

1346
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,810
if you ever had a cold and
your sinuses are stuffed up,

1347
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,310
you feel like you have
congestion here and here

1348
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,600
and around your ears and in
your cheeks and in your face,

1349
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,160
and that's because the sinuses

1350
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,890
are actually portals where
the bones are fused together

1351
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,800
and interdigitated like this,

1352
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,000
but they're lined, of
course, with mucus membranes,

1353
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,100
and as you start to nasal-breathe more,

1354
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,240
the nasal passages will
start to dilate more,

1355
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,270
don't worry, you're not
going to get giant nostrils,

1356
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,700
but what's going to end up happening

1357
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,820
is you're going to have an easier time

1358
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,210
breathing through your
nose just from waking,

1359
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,280
so my advice would be

1360
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,560
breathe through your nose while exercising

1361
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,840
unless you're in maximum effort,

1362
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,930
pretty soon, what you'll find

1363
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,600
is you actually can create more output

1364
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,550
than you would if you were
breathing through your mouth,

1365
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,090
and of course, there
are exceptions to this,

1366
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,500
if you're swimming, follow
that breath protocol,

1367
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,910
for fighters and martial artists,

1368
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,260
there's reason to do

1369
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,330
the kind of exhale
breathing through the mouth,

1370
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:29,450
that shh kind of thing,

1371
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,510
you know, there are reasons
to do that sort of thing

1372
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,450
for particular sports,

1373
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,350
but for most people who are

1374
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,100
kind of recreational
athletes or exercisers,

1375
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,470
learn to be a nasal-breather,

1376
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,270
it has positive cosmetic effects,

1377
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:42,460
it reduces apnea, it
offloads more carbon dioxide,

1378
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,590
it increases lung capacity,
it dilates the sinuses,

1379
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,490
and it prevents apnea in sleep,

1380
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,670
so unless you have severe
apnea and you need the CPAP,

1381
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,010
becoming a nasal-breather

1382
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,470
can have all sorts of positive effects

1383
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:57,330
by reducing cortisol, reducing apnea,

1384
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:01,240
and indirectly, raising
testosterone and estrogen

1385
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,760
in the proper ratios,

1386
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,130
so this might seem kind of
foundational and indirect,

1387
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,310
but when you go into the
scientific literature,

1388
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,140
it comes through as one of
the most powerful things

1389
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,370
that you can do that is zero cost,

1390
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,600
takes a little effort but it's zero cost,

1391
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,550
and it has all of these positive
effects across the board,

1392
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,670
you know, both cosmetic

1393
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,820
and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera,

1394
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,730
so that's the first piece
of behavioral advice.

1395
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,480
The second piece of behavioral advice

1396
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,570
relates to the viewing of light,

1397
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,210
and many of you have heard
me talk about this before,

1398
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,080
and I'm not going to belabor the point

1399
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,380
that viewing bright light
within the first hour of waking,

1400
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,700
whether or not it's from artificial light

1401
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,000
or ideally, from sunlight,

1402
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,100
has these powerful effects
on sleep and wakefulness,

1403
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,620
but we have to return to this

1404
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:49,040
if you want to understand
how light can impact hormones

1405
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,240
because hormones, light, and dopamine

1406
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,070
have a very close-knit relationship,

1407
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,440
so much so that your
light-viewing behavior

1408
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,570
can actually have a direct effect

1409
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,760
on hormone levels and fertility,

1410
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,400
it can have a direct effect
on hormone levels and libido,

1411
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,020
it can have a direct
effect on hormone levels

1412
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,840
and your ability to heal quickly,

1413
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,350
and I'm not talking about shining light

1414
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,460
on particular injuries,

1415
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,560
that may or may not have positive effects,

1416
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:18,860
we can argue about that on a
subsequent episode, it may,

1417
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,350
but what I'm talking about is
viewing light with your eyes,

1418
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,610
so let's talk about that now

1419
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:26,460
because the scientific
literature on this are robust

1420
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,450
and they extend back several decades,

1421
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,950
and yet, I think most people
don't really understand

1422
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,450
how powerful this relationship is

1423
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,220
between light, dopamine, hormones,

1424
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,710
and all the great things that
the sex steroid hormones do

1425
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,020
when they're available in your
body in the proper ratios.

1426
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,970
In order to understand
the powerful effects

1427
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,770
that light can have on
the sex steroid hormones,

1428
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:49,060
we need to understand
seasonal breeding animals,

1429
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,200
now, humans are not seasonal breeders,

1430
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,840
but if you understand the biology

1431
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,400
of how light impacts various
neurotransmitters and hormones,

1432
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,320
you'll set yourself up
for a deep understanding

1433
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,060
of what you should do with
your light-viewing behavior.

1434
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,670
So several species of animals,

1435
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:08,010
many species of animals, in
fact, like rabbits and fox,

1436
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,380
and various mustelids,
like ferrets and ermines,

1437
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,000
change their pellage
color across the seasons,

1438
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,820
this might be kind of a duh,

1439
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,700
but fox in winter are
often white or light gray,

1440
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,170
and those same animals will
be brown or darker-colored

1441
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,380
in the summertime and spring months.

1442
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,750
Now, those same animals
breed in the spring,

1443
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,430
and they shut down breeding,

1444
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,940
they actually shut down ovulation,

1445
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,350
they often shut down
testosterone production

1446
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,940
in the winter months,

1447
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,240
so right now I'm just
correlating color of fur

1448
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,180
with tendency to breed,

1449
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:46,180
tendency to breed, as we
know, is going to be related

1450
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,960
to the levels of sex steroid hormones,

1451
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,443
estrogen and testosterone.

1452
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,320
Now, why would these two things be linked?

1453
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,940
Well, it turns out that dopamine
is the link between them,

1454
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,293
so dopamine has a precursor,
that precursor is tyrosine,

1455
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,620
which is amino acid, comes from food,

1456
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,990
and when dopamine levels are
high, as I mentioned before,

1457
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:10,300
there's a tendency for more
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

1458
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,340
luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone,

1459
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,270
all the hormones that come

1460
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,620
from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis

1461
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,400
and stimulate estrogen
and testosterone release

1462
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,003
from the ovary and testes,

1463
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,273
dopamine basically increases all of that.

1464
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,700
The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine,

1465
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,510
but the precursor to a lot

1466
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:33,340
of the melanin-producing elements of cells

1467
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,390
that give pigmentation,
including for the hair,

1468
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:41,320
is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme,

1469
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,480
so yes, the same amino acid-based pathway,

1470
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,460
and many of the same enzymes
that are devoted to dopamine

1471
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,860
and dopamine increasing
the sex steroid hormones

1472
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,453
are devoted to giving
pigmentation to the hair and skin,

1473
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,970
and this is why in the summer
months, when days are longer,

1474
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,310
animals are breeding more,

1475
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,610
and this is also why in the winter months

1476
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:11,670
when days are shorter,
animals are breeding less,

1477
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:15,750
this is also why in humans,
many people, not all,

1478
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,830
feel an elevation in mood in
the spring and summer months

1479
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,220
because of the amount of
sunlight they're getting

1480
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,420
is increased relative
to the winter months.

1481
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,397
Now, some of you may be saying,

1482
01:00:25,397 --> 01:00:27,430
"I love the fall, I love the winter,"

1483
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,890
sensitivity to light in
these dopamine systems

1484
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,210
has a strong genetic component,

1485
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,480
so you go to some areas of the world,

1486
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,110
I have relatives who are Scandinavian,

1487
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,340
and in some areas of Scandinavia,

1488
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,630
people know that there's

1489
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,050
a kind of seasonal affective disorder,

1490
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,680
there's kind of a seasonal depression

1491
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,510
and people get sadder and
more quiescent in the winter,

1492
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,650
there's actually less going out,

1493
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,820
and therefore, there's
less sexual behavior,

1494
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,600
there's less partying
and things of that sort,

1495
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,907
but other people will say,

1496
01:00:53,907 --> 01:00:56,007
"No, during the winter
months, I feel great

1497
01:00:56,007 --> 01:00:58,010
"and I love the holidays
around winter," et cetera,

1498
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,610
so there's a lot of variation,

1499
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,440
but in general, the
pathway is the following,

1500
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,440
increased viewing of sunlight,
and it has to be to the eyes,

1501
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,950
it's not to the skin,

1502
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,810
increased viewing of sunlight

1503
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,210
increases dopamine levels in the brain,

1504
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,880
increased dopamine levels
in animals and humans

1505
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,360
increases the amount of these melanocytes

1506
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,820
and the activity of these
melanin-producing cells,

1507
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,740
which give pigmentation
to the skin and hair,

1508
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:27,800
and indirectly, increase the amount

1509
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,750
of testosterone and estrogen,

1510
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,830
and thereby, reproductive behavior,

1511
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:34,640
feelings of well-being,
social interactions,

1512
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,400
reductions in anxiety, et cetera,

1513
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,470
all of which should make sense

1514
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:39,570
based on what we've talked about already

1515
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,170
in terms of the biology

1516
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,930
and the impact of these steroid hormones

1517
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,470
on various aspects of the mind and body.

1518
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,030
So how does this translate to a protocol?

1519
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,060
This translates to the protocol of,

1520
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,410
if you want to optimize
testosterone and estrogen,

1521
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,060
you need to get your
light-viewing behavior correct,

1522
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,000
it's not just about optimizing your sleep,

1523
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,040
which is also important,

1524
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,790
it's about getting sufficient
amount of light in your eyes

1525
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,170
so you have sufficient levels of dopamine,

1526
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,150
so the simple protocols for
that I've reviewed before,

1527
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,280
but it means getting
anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes

1528
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,030
of bright light exposure in
your eyes early in the day,

1529
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,740
it is not sufficient to
do this with sunglasses

1530
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,530
unless you have to do
that for safety reasons,

1531
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:21,200
it's fine to wear prescription
lenses and contacts,

1532
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,130
if you can't get sunlight
for whatever reason,

1533
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,950
you want to use bright artificial light,

1534
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,940
but that is absolutely critical

1535
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,330
for timing the cortisol release properly,

1536
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,910
limiting cortisol release to
the early part of the day,

1537
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,680
getting increases in dopamine
that are going to promote

1538
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,900
the production of
testosterone and estrogen

1539
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,150
to healthy levels,

1540
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,840
the other aspect of light-viewing behavior

1541
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,370
that's extremely important

1542
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,530
is to avoid bright light
exposure to your eyes

1543
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,640
in the middle of the night,

1544
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,500
if you're viewing bright light
in the middle of the night,

1545
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,470
you are suppressing dopamine release,

1546
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,210
if you're suppressing dopamine release,

1547
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:55,050
you are suppressing testosterone levels

1548
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,140
so much so that I would wager

1549
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,870
that a major effect of sleep deprivation

1550
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:04,090
on reducing testosterone and estrogen

1551
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,750
is not necessarily because
of the lack of sleep per se,

1552
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,180
it's because usually when people

1553
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,490
are not getting enough sleep,

1554
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,590
they're getting too
much light in their eyes

1555
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,650
in the middle of the night as well,

1556
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,700
a study on this has
not been completed yet,

1557
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,450
but there are two studies
published in "Cell" and "Neuron,"

1558
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:21,570
both Cell Press journals,
excellent journals,

1559
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,810
showing that viewing
bright light with the eyes

1560
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,410
in the middle of the circadian night

1561
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,740
has a detrimental effect on dopamine,

1562
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,520
and therefore has a detrimental effect

1563
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,790
on things like testosterone and estrogen,

1564
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,190
so you can't even begin
to talk about supplements

1565
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:38,080
and other ways to optimize testosterone,

1566
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,997
diet and its effects on
testosterone and estrogen

1567
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:43,060
and fertility and reproductive
behavior, et cetera,

1568
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,930
until you get your breathing right,

1569
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:48,440
until you get things like your
light-viewing behavior right,

1570
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,980
so bright light early in the day

1571
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,100
and throughout the day is great,

1572
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,200
view as much bright light,
ideally sunlight, as you can,

1573
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,640
as much as you safely can,

1574
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,770
you obviously don't want
to burn your retinas

1575
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:59,630
or damage your retinas,

1576
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,900
so never look at any light

1577
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,670
that's so bright it's painful to look at,

1578
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,300
but getting a lot of light in your eyes

1579
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,620
is not just about adjusting
your sleep-wake rhythms,

1580
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,560
it's also about optimizing
your sex steroid hormones,

1581
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,400
and avoiding bright light
in the middle of the night

1582
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,220
is not just about not
disrupting your sleep,

1583
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,470
it's also about optimizing
the sex steroid hormones,

1584
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,070
and now that you understand

1585
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,640
a bit of how the sex steroid hormones work

1586
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,970
and how powerful they
are for reducing anxiety

1587
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,750
and all these other effects,

1588
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,700
this should be straightforward to do,

1589
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,090
or hopefully it's inspired you

1590
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,860
to get your light-viewing behavior

1591
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,590
and your breathing behavior correct.

1592
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,920
In fact, in thinking about tools,

1593
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,370
for many people that are suffering

1594
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:38,460
from low levels of estrogen
if they want higher levels

1595
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,370
or low levels of testosterone
if they want higher levels,

1596
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:44,550
just getting the breathing
and light-viewing behavior,

1597
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:48,400
which will indirectly
support sleep behavior,

1598
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,540
can be a huge and positive effect

1599
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,760
on levels of sex steroid hormones.

1600
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,650
I can already anticipate
that in hearing this,

1601
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,040
you might wonder whether
or not viewing light

1602
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,510
is going to, for instance,
increase your testosterone a lot

1603
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,750
when in fact you want
your estrogen increased,

1604
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,730
or it's going to increase
your estrogen a lot

1605
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:09,460
when you want your testosterone increased,

1606
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:12,550
everything I'm describing
here is for people,

1607
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:15,230
regardless of chromosomal
or gonadal background,

1608
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:18,620
so I'm trying to basically
offer all this information

1609
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,850
in one swoop,

1610
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:24,010
but basically, if you're somebody
who naturally has ovaries

1611
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,620
and has higher levels of
estrogen than testosterone,

1612
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,940
then viewing bright
light early in the day,

1613
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,970
because of dopamine's effects,

1614
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,010
is going to promote more estrogen

1615
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,010
and subtle increases in testosterone,

1616
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,650
whereas if you're somebody who starts off

1617
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,230
with more testosterone and lower estrogen,

1618
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:42,490
so somebody presumably who has testes

1619
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,380
or maybe you're supplementing
with testosterone

1620
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,420
through other sources for whatever reason,

1621
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,320
bright-light viewing

1622
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,360
is going to increase testosterone
and estrogen in parallel,

1623
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,750
but you're still going to maintain

1624
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,630
the ratio of testosterone to estrogen,

1625
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,100
in short, you don't have to worry

1626
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,870
that you're going to
increase the wrong hormone,

1627
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,090
this is all about optimizing
the ratios of hormones

1628
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,850
that you already have.

1629
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,400
Okay, so we've talked about breathing,

1630
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,960
we've talked about light,

1631
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,320
let's talk about a third element

1632
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,870
that there seems to be some
excitement about lately

1633
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,980
for other reasons

1634
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:12,970
but that can actually have

1635
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:17,180
some pretty profound
influences on hormone levels,

1636
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,200
and that's heat and cold,

1637
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,850
so as always, rather
than just offer a tool,

1638
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,090
I'm going to tell you
the underlying science

1639
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,360
as it relates to naturally
occurring phenomena

1640
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,700
because, in understanding that

1641
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,190
and understanding the mechanism,

1642
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,510
you're going to be in
a far better position

1643
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,730
to understand the tools and mechanisms

1644
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,780
and how you might want to
adjust them for your own life.

1645
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,160
So now you understand the relationship

1646
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:43,150
between light, day length,
dopamine, and hormone levels,

1647
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:45,540
and everyone should realize

1648
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,030
that temperature and
day length are linked,

1649
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:49,100
and I'm sure as I say that,

1650
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,180
you're probably thinking, "Oh, of course."

1651
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,870
In summer, when there's more sunlight,

1652
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,530
days are longer, nights are shorter,

1653
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,350
in general, it tends to be warmer out,

1654
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,810
and in winter, when nights
are longer, days are shorter,

1655
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,800
it tends to be colder out,

1656
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,800
and in the winter months,

1657
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,510
testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower

1658
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:09,113
in many animals and in humans,

1659
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,920
and in the summer months,

1660
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,390
because of the role of dopamine

1661
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:16,010
in promoting the sex steroid hormones,

1662
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:18,840
when days are longer and it's warmer,

1663
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,850
humans tend to make more
estrogen and testosterone

1664
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,260
relative to the other months of the year.

1665
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,400
Now, these effects can be
somewhat weak and modulated

1666
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,850
as opposed to in
seasonally breeding animals

1667
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:32,150
where they're really dramatic, okay?

1668
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:36,330
But the point is that temperature

1669
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,330
and day length and sunlight,

1670
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,230
those are all intimately related

1671
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,820
because of the systems
that we evolved in, right?

1672
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,320
So before we had artificial light

1673
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,770
and artificial heating
and artificial cooling,

1674
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,530
our biology evolved under systems

1675
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:52,130
where temperature, day
length, and the hormones

1676
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,140
were correlated with one another,

1677
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,900
so nowadays, there's a lot
of interest in using cold

1678
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,990
as a way to stimulate testosterone,

1679
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:03,310
this is mainly because
in the sports community,

1680
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,530
in particular, in the
bodybuilding community,

1681
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,260
they are always seeking ways

1682
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,670
to maximize testosterone,
dihydrotestosterone,

1683
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,040
keep estrogen to its minimum required

1684
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,100
to still have a libido and
still have skin elasticity

1685
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,500
but also walk around with Saran-wrap skin,

1686
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,550
then all this kind of extreme
stuff that happens there

1687
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:23,680
has led to a recent movement
where, believe it or not,

1688
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,819
I heard this and I couldn't
believe it, I went and checked,

1689
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:26,879
but although I didn't buy them,

1690
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,883
that on Amazon, you can actually find,

1691
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:34,229
they're literally underwear
that have ice packs,

1692
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:35,839
so I think they are ice pack underwear,

1693
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,310
so that people are making themselves cold

1694
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,670
at the level of the gonads

1695
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,660
in order to try and increase
testosterone and libido,

1696
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,990
sounds pretty crazy,

1697
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:46,100
but believe it or not,

1698
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,790
that and things like ice
baths and cold showers

1699
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:53,200
can have positive effects
on the sex steroid hormones,

1700
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,260
both testosterone, mainly in males,

1701
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,920
and estrogen, mainly in females,

1702
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,147
and you might say, "Wait, I thought cold

1703
01:09:01,147 --> 01:09:04,947
"makes the reproductive
axis kind of shut down a bit

1704
01:09:04,947 --> 01:09:07,300
"or reduces testosterone and estrogen,"

1705
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,779
but it turns out it's
not actually the cold

1706
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,749
that's having these effects in people,

1707
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,210
things like the ice bath, cold
showers, cold-water swims,

1708
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,950
these ice underwear or whatever they are,

1709
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:20,933
can't believe that these actually
exist, but they do exist,

1710
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:25,270
what happens is there's
a rebound in vasodilation

1711
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:29,240
after cooling, so cooling
causes vasoconstriction,

1712
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,279
and then after the cooling,
there's a rebound vasodilation

1713
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,749
and there's more infusion
of blood into the gonads.

1714
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,479
There's also an effect that's neural,

1715
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,389
so let me explain how this works

1716
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,500
because there are only
a few studies on this,

1717
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,220
none of which looking
at the frozen underwear,

1718
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,859
but that have looked at cold exposure

1719
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,059
and levels of androgens and estrogens,

1720
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,630
and it's kind of interesting,

1721
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,890
so you have to remember that the gonad,

1722
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:57,590
the ovaries and the testes
are heavily vascularized.

1723
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,540
Remember, even at the level of the brain,

1724
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,810
GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

1725
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:03,990
comes from neurons
that, believe it or not,

1726
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:06,150
start off in your nose
early in development,

1727
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,660
migrate into the hypothalamus.

1728
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,300
I'm not making that up, they
started off in your nose

1729
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,970
and migrated to the hypothalamus.

1730
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:14,700
Those neurons extend
processes, we call them axons,

1731
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:19,700
into the pituitary and release
GnRH into the pituitary.

1732
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,420
There's a lot of vascularization
within the pituitary,

1733
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:25,460
so now those hormones, or GnRH,

1734
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,880
can stimulate
follicle-stimulating hormone,

1735
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,830
luteinizing hormone,

1736
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,733
which then are released and
travel into the bloodstream.

1737
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:36,530
Then those hormones reach
the ovary or testes,

1738
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,410
and they have to get into
the ovary and testes,

1739
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:43,160
and the way they do that is
through the vascular system,

1740
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,960
and people forget, but the vascular system

1741
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,840
and how constricted or dilated vessels are

1742
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,580
is controlled by neurons, all right?

1743
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,640
We discussed this during
the discussion about stress

1744
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,310
in the stress episode,

1745
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:00,420
but it's well-known to neuroscientists

1746
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,340
that the best way to shut
down neurons is to cool them,

1747
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,470
so there are a lot of examples of this

1748
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,550
in the scientific literature,

1749
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:08,646
but most people aren't aware of it

1750
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:09,770
because you're not digging around

1751
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,340
in the method section of these papers,

1752
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,230
but when we want to shut down neurons,

1753
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:16,390
we can do things like inject
drugs that will do that,

1754
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,560
like lidocaine, you know,
the stuff that makes you numb

1755
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,393
at the dentist,

1756
01:11:19,393 --> 01:11:20,860
or you can use different inhibitors,

1757
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,010
but one of the best ways
to do it experimentally

1758
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,370
is to just cool neurons,

1759
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:26,650
when you make neurons cold,

1760
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,300
because there's a temperature dependence

1761
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,640
of when neurons can be
active and when they can't,

1762
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,360
the neurons shut down,

1763
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,330
so the most plausible explanation
for why cold exposure,

1764
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:40,160
either through 1 to 10-minute
ice bath or cold shower

1765
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,870
or the ice underpants thing,

1766
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:45,150
would increase testosterone
or increase estrogen

1767
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,210
is that you're cooling the neurons

1768
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:50,470
that control vasoconstriction
and vasodilation

1769
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:55,270
and shutting down the entry of blood,

1770
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,680
or at least reducing it,

1771
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,940
and hormones into the gonad,

1772
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,230
and then when the gonad
and the surrounding area

1773
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,480
heats up again,

1774
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,350
you're getting a rebound
hyper-vasodilation

1775
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:09,810
that delivers excessive
levels of, not excessive,

1776
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,410
but increased levels of
GnRH and other hormones

1777
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,330
and carriers and carrier
proteins and so forth

1778
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:18,340
that would then stimulate the gonad

1779
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,130
to release more testosterone

1780
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,900
or would stimulate the gonad
to release more estrogen,

1781
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,710
that's the most plausible
explanation I can come up with,

1782
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,920
there aren't a lot of studies

1783
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,850
looking at direct effects
of temperature on the gonad,

1784
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,430
and it's going to be a
difficult study to carry out

1785
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:35,970
in any case because unless it
were done in vitro in a dish,

1786
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:38,080
it's very hard to eliminate
all the other things

1787
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,290
like vasoconstriction and vasodilation,

1788
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,940
put simply, we don't know
whether or not cold and heat

1789
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:47,690
directly affect the production
of testosterone and estrogen,

1790
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:51,340
we only know that cold and
heat can modulate those,

1791
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,100
probably through indirect mechanisms

1792
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,040
like controlling the amount of blood flow

1793
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,930
by way of shutting down
or activating the neurons.

1794
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,370
Now, there's a lot of lore

1795
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,613
around heating up the gonads too much,

1796
01:13:01,613 --> 01:13:04,110
there's actually a whole set

1797
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:08,307
of pseudoscience webpages
out there saying,

1798
01:13:08,307 --> 01:13:09,867
"Well, if you want a girl,

1799
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:12,627
"you should conceive the child
at this room temperature,

1800
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:13,460
"and if you want a boy,

1801
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,690
"you should conceive the child
at this room temperature."

1802
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,950
I don't think there's really

1803
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:20,490
any firm scientific evidence
for that, for either one,

1804
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,030
but there's some interesting literature

1805
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:26,310
about temperature dependence
of production of hormones,

1806
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,860
and I think that it probably relates

1807
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,690
to these mechanisms of vasodilation

1808
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,330
and neural control over vasodilation,

1809
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,350
and of course, excessively high heat

1810
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,740
is not good for the testes,

1811
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,030
for sperm production, or for sperm health,

1812
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:41,180
sperm have all sorts
of proteins in the cap,

1813
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:43,120
things like pentraxins and other things

1814
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,580
that cause them to swim faster

1815
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:47,290
when they're expressed properly
and in the right locations,

1816
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,250
and heat actually alters the
location and the function

1817
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,990
of a lot of those proteins,
they're very heat sensitive,

1818
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,360
and so that's why excessive heat

1819
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,820
is truly not good for fertility,

1820
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,350
which may be independent of heat's roles

1821
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,810
in promoting estrogen or testosterone.

1822
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,690
Okay, so now we've talked about breathing,

1823
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,240
light, and temperature,

1824
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,610
we talked about parenthood,
we talked about competition,

1825
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,930
and we talked about
some pheromone effects,

1826
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:15,160
now let's talk about
particular forms of exercise

1827
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,540
and how they modulate
the steroid hormones,

1828
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:22,130
and then we're going to talk
about various supplements,

1829
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,040
both in reference to testosterone

1830
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,070
and in reference to estrogen.

1831
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:29,680
So now let's talk about how
exercise in its various forms,

1832
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,180
weight training, endurance work,

1833
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,350
weight training to failure, or
less intense weight training

1834
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,880
can impact testosterone levels,

1835
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,570
but I want to remind you that
we're talking about testosterone

1836
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:41,540
both in males and females,

1837
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,520
and based on what you know
from earlier in the episode,

1838
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,990
testosterone can have
numerous positive effects

1839
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,230
in both males and females
provided they're in optimal range.

1840
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,980
So if you look on the web,

1841
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,000
people will say, "Oh, you know,

1842
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,147
"testosterone is increased
by weight training,

1843
01:14:57,147 --> 01:14:59,030
"you want to do these big,
heavy compound movements,"

1844
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:01,320
squats and deadlifts and
chins and things of that sort,

1845
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,750
but what about the scientific studies?

1846
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:03,863
Like, what's the actual basis for this?

1847
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:05,610
Because if you just take a step back

1848
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:07,690
and look at this from the
perspective of a scientist,

1849
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,670
you'd say, okay, what is a squat?

1850
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,270
A squat is loading up a
bunch of weights on a bar

1851
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,310
and then, you know,
sitting down, essentially,

1852
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:16,110
and standing up over and over again.

1853
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,880
What's a deadlift?

1854
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,540
It's lifting heavy
weights from the ground.

1855
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,030
Why would that increase
testosterone, right?

1856
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:24,580
This is what's often not
discussed in the weight training

1857
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,270
or even the exercise science community,

1858
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:30,050
what would actually stimulate
the release of testosterone

1859
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:31,900
from the adrenals and/or testes,

1860
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,530
and which one is it,
adrenals or testes or both?

1861
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,010
And that's often not discussed,

1862
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,500
but as a neuroscientist,

1863
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,810
these are the kinds of
things we think about

1864
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:43,200
because we think always that
genes don't create behavior,

1865
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,350
immune systems don't know
when to be activated,

1866
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:48,270
lungs don't know when to inhale or exhale,

1867
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:49,570
hearts don't know when to beat

1868
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,510
except for the information
that it gets from neurons,

1869
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,950
the nervous system controls all of that,

1870
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:59,770
and so really the answer has
to be in the neural system

1871
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,250
that's related to these particular types

1872
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,260
of weight-bearing exercises.

1873
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,050
So when you go into this literature,

1874
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:09,740
it's kind of hard to find real mechanism,

1875
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,770
you see a lot of effects,

1876
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:13,410
you'll hear things like,
androgen receptor content,

1877
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,600
meaning testosterone and its derivatives,

1878
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,420
receptor content following
heavy-resistance exercise,

1879
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,710
and you'll find some examples

1880
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:23,330
that, for instance, you know,
they do muscle biopsies,

1881
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:26,140
they can actually see receptor increases,

1882
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,100
looking at either high-volume

1883
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,657
or low-volume really intense exercise,

1884
01:16:30,657 --> 01:16:33,570
and you can find a lot of that
but not a lot of mechanism

1885
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:36,080
about how the nervous
system would do this,

1886
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,280
and the reason you'd want
to know how it can do it

1887
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,910
is that you could potentially
build better protocols

1888
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:45,440
or figure out exactly
what about these movements

1889
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,900
is triggering increases

1890
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,120
in androgen receptors and testosterone.

1891
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,960
So what's interesting is
when you start digging

1892
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,350
into the more mechanistic studies,

1893
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:58,390
what you find is that
heavy weight training,

1894
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:01,690
so this is weight training where the sets

1895
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:05,887
are done with anywhere from
kind of one to eight rep range,

1896
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,320
and this translates differently

1897
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,050
depending on ratio of muscle
fiber type and so forth,

1898
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,530
but where basically people are

1899
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:15,390
working at anywhere from like,
70% to 95% of their maximum,

1900
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:16,440
or sometimes even going

1901
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,430
right down to their
one-repetition maximum,

1902
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:21,210
really kind of max effort,

1903
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:25,490
what you find is that
using the nervous system

1904
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:27,780
in a way in which they're
moving heavy loads,

1905
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,070
so that I would translate to recruitment

1906
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,730
of high-threshold motor units,

1907
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,360
for you muscle physiologists,

1908
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,610
and there's a rule in muscle physiology

1909
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,390
about the neuron recruitment
for moving muscles

1910
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:40,660
where you basically use

1911
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,940
the minimum number of
motor units of neurons

1912
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,200
to activate muscle as you possibly can,

1913
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,740
as loads increase, you have to recruit

1914
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,510
more and more neurons,

1915
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:50,560
you always hear about
recruiting muscle fibers,

1916
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,290
but really, it's recruiting more neurons

1917
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,070
to recruit more muscle fibers,

1918
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,290
and what you find is that
heavy weight training,

1919
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:00,500
but not weight training to failure

1920
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,790
where completion of a
repetition is impossible,

1921
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:06,560
leads to the greatest
increases in testosterone.

1922
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,440
Now, I'm sure there are a bunch

1923
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,000
of exercise jockeys out there

1924
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,910
that are going to come at
me with a bunch of things

1925
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:13,180
where, oh, yeah, but high volume and this,

1926
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:16,640
and training to failure and that, sure,

1927
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,410
if you're willing to kind
of put things side by side,

1928
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,530
adjust for exogenous
testosterone treatment

1929
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:23,770
and all the rest,

1930
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:25,090
which was done in these studies,

1931
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:27,140
what you find in general

1932
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:30,410
is that weight training with heavy loads,

1933
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,140
so anywhere from one-rep maximum

1934
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,910
to somewhere in the six
to eight repetition range,

1935
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:37,750
in males or females,

1936
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,860
increases testosterone significantly,

1937
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,897
and it does it for about a
day, sometimes up to 48 hours,

1938
01:18:43,897 --> 01:18:45,630
and the studies that I found

1939
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:48,830
which seem to hold the
most rigor or weight

1940
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:49,960
based on where they're published

1941
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:50,870
as opposed to being published

1942
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:51,880
in the journal of "Never Heard of It,"

1943
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,610
they're published in good-quality

1944
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:55,223
exercise physiology journals,

1945
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,910
for instance, the paper by Ratamess,

1946
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:04,070
R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al.,

1947
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,460
which was published in 2005,

1948
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:09,450
which talks about modulations
in androgen receptor content

1949
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,970
after heavy resistance exercise,

1950
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,610
looks at going to failure
and not to failure,

1951
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:18,610
the work of Izquierdo et
al. published in 2006,

1952
01:19:18,817 --> 01:19:20,257
"Differential Effects of Strength Training

1953
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:21,827
"Leading to Failure Versus Not Failure

1954
01:19:21,827 --> 01:19:24,440
"on Hormonal Responses,
Strength, and Power Gains,"

1955
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,010
you know, there are a lot of studies here

1956
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:29,550
and I will certainly put the
links to these in the caption,

1957
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,840
many of these actually
include Duncan French,

1958
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,200
who runs the UFC training center

1959
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,710
who I've had the privilege of meeting

1960
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,210
and discussing some of this with before,

1961
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,930
as well as other authors, of course,

1962
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,170
but they all point to the fact

1963
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:44,560
that there's something about
the engagement of the neurons

1964
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,550
that recruit high-threshold
motor units in muscle

1965
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,360
when moving heavy loads,
but not to failure,

1966
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,320
that has to provide some
sort of feedback signal,

1967
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,770
either to the gonad to
produce more testosterone,

1968
01:19:56,770 --> 01:20:01,650
or is increasing the activity
of receptors in the body.

1969
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:03,260
Now, why do I say that?

1970
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,410
Well, this is the puzzle, right?

1971
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:06,930
How is it that a particular movement,

1972
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,340
just like how is it that
interacting with your child,

1973
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,780
is increasing or decreasing testosterone?

1974
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,270
This is the kind of fundamental question

1975
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,760
at the mechanistic level,

1976
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,140
and we answered the
question for child-rearing,

1977
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,710
it has probably something to
do with smell and pheromones,

1978
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:21,810
although I'm sure there
are other cues as well,

1979
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:26,060
but there's clearly a influence

1980
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:29,450
of hard work at the neural level

1981
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:33,160
and then at the muscular level
for increasing testosterone,

1982
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,430
and there's also clearly an
effect of working too hard

1983
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:40,320
and presumably increasing
cortisol too much,

1984
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,830
although I'm speculating there,

1985
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:44,390
in terms of reducing testosterone,

1986
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,930
and so the reason we're
getting nitty-gritty about this

1987
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:48,880
is because ultimately, we'd
really like to understand,

1988
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,270
what are the optimal protocols?

1989
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,460
You know, out there in the literature,

1990
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,510
you hear, move heavy objects
to increase testosterone,

1991
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:55,580
some of that will be converted

1992
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,550
to the more powerful androgen, DHT,

1993
01:20:57,550 --> 01:20:59,710
by 5-alpha reductase et cetera,

1994
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:02,010
but we really don't understand yet

1995
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:04,770
how these particular behaviors
increase testosterone

1996
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:06,080
and whether or not it's doing that

1997
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,660
by modulating the receptors

1998
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,780
or it's modulating
testosterone release directly,

1999
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,620
presumably, testosterone release directly

2000
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,473
and sensitivity of the receptors,

2001
01:21:13,473 --> 01:21:15,730
that what most of the
muscle physiology studies

2002
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:17,520
that I was able to find point to,

2003
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,840
but this basically boils down

2004
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,550
to a particular set of protocols

2005
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:22,670
where if you want to
increase testosterone,

2006
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,240
for whatever reason,

2007
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,790
that weight training with
heavy loads but not to failure

2008
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,390
seems to be the best-supported,

2009
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:33,420
at least scientifically
supported, solution to that,

2010
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,350
now, it may not raise
your testosterone levels

2011
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,430
as high as you want,

2012
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,690
but it's definitely taking
things in the correct direction.

2013
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:42,060
Now, many of you might
be endurance athletes

2014
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,560
or also enjoy exercise

2015
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,900
besides heavy-weight-bearing exercise,

2016
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,410
and there are several studies

2017
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:52,500
exploring whether or
not endurance activity

2018
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,860
can increase or decrease androgen levels

2019
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,300
and whether or not you combine

2020
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,150
endurance activity and weight training,

2021
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,720
whether or not that has any effect

2022
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,800
if you do the endurance
activity first or second,

2023
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,070
and the takeaway from all of this

2024
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:09,930
was that endurance activity,
if performed first,

2025
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,690
leads to decreases in testosterone

2026
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,560
during the weight training session

2027
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,220
as compared to the same weight
training session done first

2028
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,570
followed by endurance activity,

2029
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,470
in other words, if you want to
optimize testosterone levels,

2030
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,930
it seems to be the case
that weight training first

2031
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:27,420
and doing cardio-type
endurance activity afterward

2032
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,380
is the right order of business.

2033
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,010
Now, when these are done on separate days,

2034
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,310
it doesn't seem to have an effect,

2035
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:35,160
they showed no statistical interaction,

2036
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,050
but it seems that if
you're going to do these

2037
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:39,250
in the same workout episode

2038
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,470
that it's move heavy loads first,

2039
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:43,910
then do cardiovascular exercise,

2040
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,230
so there's a little bit of data

2041
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,860
looking specifically at
how endurance exercise

2042
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:50,620
impacts testosterone and its derivatives,

2043
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,200
and it's very clear that
high-intensity interval training,

2044
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,410
sprinting et cetera,

2045
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,190
which somewhat mimics the neural activity

2046
01:22:57,190 --> 01:23:00,120
that occurs while moving
heavy weight loads,

2047
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,927
is going to increase testosterone

2048
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:04,830
and there's ample evidence
for that in the literature,

2049
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:09,620
and that endurance exercise
that extends beyond 75 minutes

2050
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:12,030
is going to start to lead to
reductions in testosterone,

2051
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:14,270
presumably by increases in cortisol,

2052
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:17,820
but of course, the
intensity of the exercise

2053
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,270
is going to be important too,

2054
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:21,900
you know, I don't think
anyone really believes

2055
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,190
that hiking for three hours

2056
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:25,280
is going to reduce your testosterone,

2057
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,420
whereas I think if one were to go out

2058
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,380
and run hard for three hours

2059
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,700
that you can imagine there'd
be reductions in testosterone

2060
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,580
by way of increases in cortisol,

2061
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,620
and so while this area
certainly needs more research,

2062
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:40,170
it's pretty clear that
limiting the endurance exercise

2063
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:43,140
to 75 minutes or less,
not making it too intense,

2064
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,710
is one way to keep cortisol
from going through the roof,

2065
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:48,280
but I've talked on previous episodes,

2066
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,070
and there are a lot of others
who have talked out there

2067
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:51,420
about how to clamp cortisol,

2068
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,580
how to keep cortisol more reduced,

2069
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,500
this is also one of the
reasons why, you can imagine,

2070
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,960
that various individuals,

2071
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,900
either for competition or
just for their own purposes,

2072
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,030
rely on testosterone therapy,
exogenous testosterone,

2073
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:07,550
not just for weight training,
but for endurance exercise,

2074
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,790
so this is one of the reasons
why every once in a while,

2075
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:11,310
professional cyclists will get popped

2076
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:12,870
for performance-enhancing drugs,

2077
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:14,060
meaning they'll get caught,

2078
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,670
and it's not just that they're
increasing red blood cells

2079
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:18,540
through EPO and things of that sort,

2080
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,530
oftentimes they're also
taking testosterone

2081
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,580
not because they want to be large

2082
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,020
or have massively hypertrophied muscles,

2083
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,110
but because they're
injecting testosterone,

2084
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:28,990
they don't have to worry

2085
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:31,477
about cortisol-induced
reductions in testosterone,

2086
01:24:31,477 --> 01:24:32,810
and they can just clamp,

2087
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,390
or keep their testosterone levels high,

2088
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:35,810
not something I'm recommending,

2089
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,070
but I'm just justifying the rationale

2090
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:41,230
for why an endurance athlete
would want to do that at all.

2091
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:45,100
So now let's switch over
to talking about estrogen,

2092
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,140
so there are many people

2093
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,800
who are trying to optimize
their estrogen levels,

2094
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,820
and one of the places
where this shows up a lot

2095
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,630
and I get a lot of questions
about is menopause,

2096
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,490
so menopause, as I mentioned earlier,

2097
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,910
is this fairly massive reduction
in the amount of estrogen

2098
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:01,930
that is circulating in one's blood

2099
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,400
mainly because the ovary

2100
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:08,060
is now depleted of some
estrogen production of its own,

2101
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,760
the eggs are not being produced,

2102
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,030
they've been depleted, et cetera.

2103
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:15,660
So menopause is characterized
by a variety of symptoms,

2104
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,830
and it's multifaceted,

2105
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,090
probably deserves an
entire episode on its own,

2106
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:23,340
but things like hot flashes,
things like mood swings,

2107
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,630
things like headaches, in
particular migraine headaches,

2108
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:28,320
there can be a lot of brain fog,

2109
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,530
it can be very, very
disruptive for people.

2110
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:32,310
Now, you sometimes hear about andropause,

2111
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:35,150
which is thought to be the
kind of analog to menopause,

2112
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:37,440
but menopause has certain characteristics

2113
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:42,440
that make it a very robust
phenomenon for most women,

2114
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:44,670
whereas for men,

2115
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,580
andropause is going to sometimes
happen, sometimes won't,

2116
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,620
in fact, without going into the details

2117
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,910
of the graphs and the data,

2118
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,610
it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,

2119
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:57,780
that some men maintain levels
of circulating androgens

2120
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,613
that are quite high,

2121
01:25:58,613 --> 01:26:00,737
even as similar as they were in puberty

2122
01:26:00,737 --> 01:26:02,640
and their teen years and 20s,

2123
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,670
well into their 60s, 70s, and 80s

2124
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,487
if they're optimizing
a lot of other things,

2125
01:26:06,487 --> 01:26:09,220
and probably genetics
plays a role as well,

2126
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:10,970
whereas some males won't,

2127
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:13,660
but within the female population,

2128
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:16,370
or population of individuals
that have ovaries,

2129
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:18,880
there's a very stereotyped
and characteristic

2130
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,700
reduction in estrogen levels

2131
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,930
as the number of eggs becomes depleted,

2132
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,490
and that's what we think of as menopause.

2133
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:28,450
So what are the various things

2134
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:30,050
that one can do for menopause?

2135
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,660
Well, one of the most common ones

2136
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:36,060
is that physicians will
prescribe supplemental estrogen,

2137
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:37,810
so this is hormone therapy

2138
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:40,040
where somebody takes
either their oral estrogen

2139
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,100
or they'll use a patch or a pellet,

2140
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:45,500
some way to secrete
estradiol into the system,

2141
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:49,360
and that has varying success
depending on the individual,

2142
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,040
some people respond very well to it,

2143
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,310
other people really
have challenges with it,

2144
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:55,400
and there are a lot of side
effects associated with it

2145
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,660
for some people, not others,

2146
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:00,250
in addition, there's a concern always

2147
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,900
about supplementing estrogen

2148
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:06,200
when there's a breast cancer
background in the family

2149
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,250
or there's concern about
breast cancer for any reason

2150
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,150
because a lot of those cancers
are estrogen-dependent,

2151
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:15,210
and that's why drugs like
tamoxifen and anastrozole

2152
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:18,090
and drugs that block either aromatase

2153
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:21,320
or block, excuse me,
estrogen receptors directly

2154
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,060
were initially developed,

2155
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,610
you see them a lot on the internet,

2156
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:27,410
again, for all the sports folks

2157
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,290
who are trying to increase
testosterone, reduce estrogen,

2158
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,440
but remember, those drugs
were initially developed

2159
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,410
as ways to prevent estrogen
binding to the estrogen receptor

2160
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,180
as cancer treatments,

2161
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,610
so I want to be very clear

2162
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:41,740
and I've said this many times,

2163
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:44,830
we always put it in the caption
of each episode, of course,

2164
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:47,250
that I'm not a physician, I'm not an M.D.,

2165
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,170
I don't prescribe anything,

2166
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:49,610
I'm a professor and I profess things,

2167
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,190
I'm here to translate
the scientific literature

2168
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:52,380
and point to what might be

2169
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,760
some useful avenues for exploration,

2170
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,330
but this is just for information purposes,

2171
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:58,340
you should definitely talk to your doctor

2172
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,150
about anything that I'm talking about now

2173
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,430
or in any episode, for that matter.

2174
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:06,240
So if you look at the
literature on menopause

2175
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,160
outside of just standard estrogen therapy,

2176
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,940
there are some very
interesting compounds out there

2177
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:13,773
that have been used

2178
01:28:13,773 --> 01:28:17,460
and that are supported by
quality peer-reviewed studies,

2179
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,450
and again, I'll refer you once again

2180
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,760
to this amazing website, examine.com,

2181
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,340
where you can put in
essentially any condition

2182
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,173
or any supplement,

2183
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:27,430
and it will point you to
the human effect matrix,

2184
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:29,440
not animal studies,

2185
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,220
but human studies that
have explored these things.

2186
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,380
Now, there are a huge variety of them here

2187
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,870
so I won't go into all of them,

2188
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:38,870
but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds

2189
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,240
that have been shown to be powerful

2190
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,360
in the context of menopause,

2191
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,340
as well as other conditions

2192
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:49,000
where estrogen is lower
than one would like,

2193
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,390
include a description in
some of the literature,

2194
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:52,410
I'll get into this in a moment,

2195
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,970
of something like black cohosh,

2196
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,600
I think that's the correct pronunciation,

2197
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:01,000
it's literally the word
black and then C-O-H-O-S-H,

2198
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,680
and it's very interesting,

2199
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,870
there are 13 peer-reviewed studies

2200
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:08,420
that have reached prominence

2201
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:10,090
in the kind of commercial landscape

2202
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:12,570
where this substance, black cohosh,

2203
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:15,170
has been promoted as a
way to increase estrogen,

2204
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:18,360
turns out that the effects are consistent

2205
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,530
but are fairly minor,

2206
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:22,290
fairly minor increases in estrogen,

2207
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,110
so it does seem to be a real effect,

2208
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,020
it is significant over the placebo effect,

2209
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,970
but there's also a
significant placebo effect

2210
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:32,740
in some of these studies as well,

2211
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:35,740
so what's interesting when
you look at these studies

2212
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:38,090
is that many of them were carried out

2213
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:40,430
over a period of six-plus months,

2214
01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:42,350
they're double-blind studies, et cetera,

2215
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:46,860
and almost all of them lead to
modest increases in estrogen

2216
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:51,860
and modest decreases in
menopause-related symptoms.

2217
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:56,260
Now, a few additional
details about these studies,

2218
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:00,620
they were generally carried
out on women age 45 to 64,

2219
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:03,370
in some cases, they look
specifically at women

2220
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:05,200
that were clinically obese or overweight,

2221
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,070
although not always,

2222
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:09,320
the subject size pools are pretty big,

2223
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,120
you know, anywhere from 50 to 87,

2224
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:16,110
these are decent size,
132 subjects, et cetera,

2225
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,997
so these look to be like quality studies,

2226
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:20,360
and they basically point to
the fact that black cohosh

2227
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:25,080
can have a modest effect in
improving menopause symptoms.

2228
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,270
The other one is Panax ginseng,

2229
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:31,680
so P-N-A-A-X ginseng,

2230
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,380
has been shown to decrease some symptoms

2231
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:37,120
associated with menopause,
mostly related to libido,

2232
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,270
although the other
effects were unreliable.

2233
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:41,760
Other things, like maca,

2234
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,810
which is known to increase
dopamine actually,

2235
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,440
had minor effects,

2236
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,200
things like, the names here

2237
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,580
are a little hard to
pronounce, so forgive me,

2238
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:53,010
things like Valeriana officinalis

2239
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:55,860
has shown that there
can be some improvement

2240
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,470
in the hot flash symptoms

2241
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:59,400
and some of the insomnia
associated with that,

2242
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,230
so that might be worth exploring,

2243
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:02,750
again, discuss with your doctor,

2244
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:06,253
but these were both 100-subject plus,

2245
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:09,460
age 45 to 64 individuals,

2246
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,560
double-blind placebo-controlled studies

2247
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:14,680
that showed significant
but modest effects.

2248
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,930
There was one substance

2249
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:21,880
in the gallery of the
compounds that was looked at

2250
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:24,530
that turns out to be
particularly interesting,

2251
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:27,600
and this one is also particularly
difficult to pronounce,

2252
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,040
and it's Pueraria mirifica,

2253
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,810
so I'm going to spell this out for you,

2254
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:38,810
it's P-U-E-R-A-R-I-A, Pueraria,

2255
01:31:40,164 --> 01:31:45,164
mirifica, M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A,

2256
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:49,140
and there are four
studies on this compound

2257
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:53,290
that show, in every case,
it to be very potent,

2258
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:56,130
in fact, comparable to estrogen therapy,

2259
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:57,950
estrogen replacement therapy,

2260
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:59,840
in reducing the symptoms of menopause,

2261
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,290
so this was pretty striking

2262
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:02,660
because when you go through these studies

2263
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:03,493
and you look again

2264
01:32:03,493 --> 01:32:06,970
that they seem to be
pretty well controlled,

2265
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,770
as far as I could tell,

2266
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,633
and they explored a
pretty wide subject pool,

2267
01:32:12,591 --> 01:32:16,180
and it seems that every
single one of these studies,

2268
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:21,180
when looking side by side
at Pueraria mirifica,

2269
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:22,880
which is also called,

2270
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,563
now this is really hard to
pronounce, Kwao Krua Kao,

2271
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:30,423
I guess that's the name that
they use in various countries,

2272
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:33,950
that it was comparable to
estrogen replacement therapy,

2273
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:36,940
so I mentioned this because
a lot of people contacted me

2274
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:39,137
and said, "What about the
insomnia in menopause?

2275
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,150
"What about the headaches in menopause?"

2276
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:42,620
Now, I'm not suggesting you run out

2277
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,380
and immediately start taking
any of these compounds,

2278
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:45,690
please talk to your doctor,

2279
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:48,480
you know, any hormone-related compound

2280
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,690
is a serious consideration

2281
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,190
because of the relationship
to breast cancers,

2282
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:55,460
but just in general, these compounds are,

2283
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:57,810
estrogen and testosterone,
are exceedingly powerful

2284
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:01,287
in terms of controlling our
mental and physical states,

2285
01:33:01,287 --> 01:33:03,550
and so you want to
approach them with caution,

2286
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,420
but I thought that that one
in particular was interesting

2287
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,670
and for which there are quite
a few PubMed-documented,

2288
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,360
peer-reviewed studies in quality journals.

2289
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,370
Okay, so now let's talk

2290
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:16,380
about the role of specific compounds,

2291
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,470
some of which, many of which can be taken

2292
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:22,560
in supplementation form or
extracted from diet and nutrition

2293
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,640
in order to optimize sex steroid hormones,

2294
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,680
and again, I just want to emphasize

2295
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,710
that I'm not suggesting
anyone take anything

2296
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,040
or stop taking anything,

2297
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,100
this is purely for informational purposes,

2298
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,480
but some of the data on these

2299
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,263
is quite striking and impressive.

2300
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:40,820
It's very clear

2301
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:45,300
that certain collections
of nutrients are useful

2302
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,680
for promoting testosterone
and estrogen production

2303
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,610
in their proper ratios,

2304
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:52,930
and those things are what I would call

2305
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:54,840
the sort of usual suspects,

2306
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,650
vitamin D, which is important

2307
01:33:56,650 --> 01:33:58,830
for so many biological functions,

2308
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:00,530
including endocrine functions,

2309
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:04,030
zinc, magnesium, et cetera,

2310
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:06,360
and if you want to look
into this more deeply

2311
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,193
and you want to understand

2312
01:34:07,193 --> 01:34:08,950
exactly what the negative effects are

2313
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:10,960
of not having sufficient
zinc and magnesium,

2314
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,350
and what those levels might actually be,

2315
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,600
there's a paper that's
available, you can go on PubMed,

2316
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,270
I can't pronounce this
last name, I'm sorry,

2317
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:24,270
it looks to me like Wrzosek,
but it's W-R-Z-O-S-E-K,

2318
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:29,500
I hope I didn't butcher that
too badly, Wrzosek et al. 2020

2319
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:33,080
in "Endocrinology and Metabolism Review,"

2320
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,990
so this is a recent paper in
a good, peer-reviewed journal

2321
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:37,300
that talks mainly about

2322
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:41,500
how the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

2323
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,080
and the sex steroid hormones

2324
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:47,440
are negatively impacted by
deficiencies in magnesium,

2325
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,110
deficiencies in vitamin D,
and deficiencies in zinc,

2326
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:53,310
however, that doesn't point to the levels

2327
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:56,610
that one should take in order to optimize,

2328
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:58,820
so it doesn't say take X amount of zinc

2329
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,210
or X amount of magnesium
or X amount of vitamin D,

2330
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:02,940
for that information,

2331
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:07,240
because it's so context-dependent
and individual-dependent,

2332
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,500
I highly recommend you go to examine.com,

2333
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,700
you can put in zinc or
magnesium or vitamin D,

2334
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,100
and they will give you ranges of dosages

2335
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,920
that are supported by specific studies,

2336
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,800
again, that information
is completely free to you,

2337
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,140
and it's very useful in figuring that out.

2338
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,920
I personally have supplemented

2339
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,930
with zinc, magnesium,
and vitamin D for years,

2340
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,390
but many other people do that as well,

2341
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,710
and the question is always, how much?

2342
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,270
And that's why I'm a proponent
of getting blood work done

2343
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:33,103
because that's how you know

2344
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:34,960
whether or not your androgen levels,

2345
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,380
as well as things like
vitamin D levels, et cetera,

2346
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:39,280
are sufficiently high,

2347
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,810
so the takeaway from these studies

2348
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:43,300
looking at what deficiencies cause

2349
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,840
in terms of deficits in
testosterone and estrogen

2350
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,740
really point in the direction of,

2351
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:50,620
make sure you're getting
adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3

2352
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:54,020
unless you want these steroid
hormone levels to be reduced

2353
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,300
for whatever reason.

2354
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:57,720
One of the things that's been
shown time and time again

2355
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,940
to have very negative effects
on sex steroid hormones,

2356
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:04,370
testosterone mainly men,
estrogen mainly in women,

2357
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:06,570
is opioids.

2358
01:36:06,570 --> 01:36:08,180
There's this whole issue, of course,

2359
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:11,960
of the opioid epidemic, it's
deserving of an entire episode,

2360
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,930
we are going to talk about
that with experts in addiction

2361
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:19,220
and people that treat pain and so forth,

2362
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,960
but the opioids dramatically reduce

2363
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,500
levels of testosterone and estrogen,

2364
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:29,530
and they do that mainly by
disrupting the receptors

2365
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:31,820
on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons,

2366
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,350
these neurons within the hypothalamus

2367
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:35,020
that communicate to the pituitary,

2368
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:38,290
and in fact, people that take
large amounts of opioids,

2369
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:41,470
or even take low levels of
opioids for long periods of time,

2370
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:44,050
will develop all sorts
of endocrine syndromes,

2371
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:45,900
that's been shown over and over again,

2372
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,740
gynecomastia, or male
breast development in males,

2373
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:51,150
disruptions to the ovary in females,

2374
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:53,700
it's really a quite terrible situation,

2375
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:58,190
so excessive opioids are very problematic

2376
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,580
for sex steroid hormones,

2377
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,060
I don't think anyone will have any trouble

2378
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,170
finding any literature on that,

2379
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:04,130
you can just go into PubMed,

2380
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:09,110
you can put opioids, testosterone,
or opioids, estrogen,

2381
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:11,870
but the major effect is actually
way up in the hypothalamus

2382
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:14,060
to shut down the production of GnRH,

2383
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,780
the very hormone that stimulates

2384
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,900
testosterone and estrogen release.

2385
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,297
Now, there's an entire
industry devoted to supplements

2386
01:37:21,297 --> 01:37:22,930
and various things that people can take

2387
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:24,260
to increase testosterone,

2388
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,620
some of which have scientific
data to support them,

2389
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,180
some of which do not,

2390
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:31,550
and some of which have anecdotal support

2391
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,330
and some of which do not.

2392
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:35,060
This ranges so broadly,

2393
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:38,800
I mean, things like the
material off deer antlers,

2394
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,360
which is high in, supposedly, IGF1,

2395
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,790
which is in the growth hormone pathway,

2396
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:48,680
all the way to actual
consumption of bull testes,

2397
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,200
you can go on Amazon right now,

2398
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,033
I certainly don't
suggest that you do this,

2399
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:55,700
and you can actually buy
ground up testes from cows,

2400
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,460
and you can consume those,

2401
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,310
now, a lot of that's going
to be broken down in the gut,

2402
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:02,950
I'm certainly not suggesting you do that,

2403
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:06,120
but just the point out this
is a huge and vast literature,

2404
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,090
and it actually dates
back hundreds of years

2405
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:12,310
even though testosterone
wasn't discovered that long ago

2406
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:14,600
as a specific hormone molecule

2407
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:18,070
and characterized and then resynthesized,

2408
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:20,150
it has a huge industry

2409
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:22,440
because of the powerful
effects that it has,

2410
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:23,800
likewise with estrogen,

2411
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,580
the development of the birth control pill

2412
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:28,200
was only made possible by
understanding the structure

2413
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,020
of estrogen and estradiol,

2414
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,710
and we're going to talk
all about birth control

2415
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:35,060
and how it works and its influence
on various other pathways

2416
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:36,520
in a future episode,

2417
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,840
but there are these supplement compounds

2418
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,830
that are supported by
the scientific literature

2419
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:45,440
in terms of their ability
to adjust androgens,

2420
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,370
things like testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone.

2421
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:49,250
One of the ones that has

2422
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:53,040
really good evidence for it is creatine,

2423
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,940
it's very clear that
something about creatine,

2424
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:58,560
although the mechanism
isn't exactly clear,

2425
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,340
either increases 5-alpha reductase

2426
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:04,480
or makes the testosterone
molecule more susceptible

2427
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,260
to certain enzymatic reactions

2428
01:39:07,260 --> 01:39:09,347
that leads to increases in DHT,

2429
01:39:09,347 --> 01:39:11,800
DHT, dihydrotestosterone,

2430
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,120
as I mentioned in the previous episode,

2431
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:15,970
has this dramatic role in creating

2432
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:19,120
a kind of masculinization
of the brain prenatally,

2433
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:22,670
it also defines the
primary sex characteristic

2434
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:24,600
of the growth of the penis, et cetera,

2435
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,200
and beyond infancy and early
childhood and later in life,

2436
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,870
it has powerful effects
in creating balding,

2437
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:33,070
in beard growth, et cetera,

2438
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:36,940
and it has a much higher affinity
for the androgen receptor

2439
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:39,230
than does testosterone,

2440
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:42,060
so creatine can increase DHT,

2441
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:45,050
which means that if you take creatine

2442
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,540
and you're very DHT-susceptible,

2443
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:49,710
then you might experience some hair loss,

2444
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:52,300
this has been heavily debated,
does creatine cause baldness?

2445
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,160
It's going to depend,

2446
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,580
it's going to depend on how
much 5-alpha reductase you have

2447
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:58,050
and how prone to hair loss you are,

2448
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:00,890
some people can take
creatine without any problem

2449
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:01,723
in terms of hair loss,

2450
01:40:01,723 --> 01:40:04,500
some people cannot, they
start losing their hair

2451
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:07,990
to levels that, at least for
them, aren't comfortable.

2452
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:10,560
There are a few other things
that can increase testosterone

2453
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,570
and it has to do with the way

2454
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:16,070
that testosterone exists in
its free and its bound form,

2455
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:20,880
so testosterone, the molecule
is kind of total testosterone,

2456
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:21,870
that's usually what's measured,

2457
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:24,290
this is the kind of levels that
are typically thrown around

2458
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:27,630
of anywhere from 300 to 900
being the kind of natural range,

2459
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,410
and then supraphysiological,

2460
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:32,040
getting up into 1,200, 1,600 range,

2461
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,180
but testosterone isn't

2462
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:36,440
just roaming around free in the blood,

2463
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,980
at least most of it isn't,

2464
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:39,180
most of it is bound

2465
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:44,180
to either sex hormone binding
globulin, SHBG, or to albumin,

2466
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:46,140
they're needed as transporters

2467
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,160
to get testosterone into cells

2468
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,250
so that testosterone can have
its effects on gene expression

2469
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:54,660
as well as other pathways
within the cells,

2470
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:58,310
so people talk about that the
level of free testosterone

2471
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:59,570
is really what's important

2472
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:01,940
and that you want to
optimize free testosterone,

2473
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:03,860
that's a little bit of a tricky statement,

2474
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:07,570
that's kind of like, it's true,

2475
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:10,600
and yet, it's not really reflective

2476
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,830
of a thorough understanding

2477
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:14,440
of how these binding globulins work,

2478
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:15,700
remember, these binding globulins

2479
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,590
aren't there to soak up
all your testosterone

2480
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,660
just to make it hard for
you to free up testosterone

2481
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:23,110
and you know, make gains in
the gym or whatever it is,

2482
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:24,190
or have increases in libido,

2483
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:26,830
they're there to actually
transport testosterone

2484
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:30,040
to specific tissues, to shuttle
them to specific tissues

2485
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,040
and to set the rate of bound
and unbound testosterone

2486
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,530
so that's it's not all unbound at once,

2487
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:38,460
and you know, it's always interesting

2488
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,320
to look in the literature

2489
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,280
and see how everyone wants

2490
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,620
to free up their testosterone
so that it can work,

2491
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:46,060
but sex hormone binding globulin

2492
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:47,900
can bind up too much testosterone

2493
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,410
to the point where it's having
negative effects on libido

2494
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:53,360
or on muscle growth and fat
loss and things of that sort,

2495
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,190
this is true in males and females,

2496
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:58,560
or it can be doing exactly
what it's supposed to do,

2497
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,690
which is shuttling testosterone

2498
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:01,840
to the proper tissues and organs

2499
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,320
where it has all these
effects, including the brain.

2500
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:08,070
So there are supplements,

2501
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:09,950
in particular, tongkat ali,

2502
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:11,540
which is, it has this other name,

2503
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,470
it's something called tongkat ali,

2504
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:14,390
sometimes it's called,

2505
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:16,590
and forgive me that
it's hard to pronounce,

2506
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:21,510
but Eurycoma longifolia Jack,

2507
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,960
they always seem to have these names

2508
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:27,160
that kind of allude to
androgenic features,

2509
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:29,320
like I don't know why, longifolia Jack,

2510
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,430
I don't know, I think it's kind of obvious

2511
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:34,230
why that sounds sort of androgenic.

2512
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:37,640
This has been shown in several studies,

2513
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,210
and you can find these on examine.com,

2514
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:41,293
or you can go to PubMed if you
like, I've looked at these,

2515
01:42:41,293 --> 01:42:43,810
that it does seem to
have some pro-fertility,

2516
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:48,810
pro-free testosterone, and
subtle aphrodisiac effects,

2517
01:42:49,230 --> 01:42:52,590
it does also seem to be
a slight anti-estrogen,

2518
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:55,340
so the reports of this are,

2519
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:58,480
people take this anywhere from
400 to 800 milligrams a day,

2520
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,920
again, I'm not suggesting you do that,

2521
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,290
but that's kind of what's out there,

2522
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:03,880
and there is some decent
scientific literature

2523
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,710
to support the fact that it liberates

2524
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:07,840
some of the bound testosterone

2525
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,580
and allows more free
testosterone to be available,

2526
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:12,930
some of the reported
quote-unquote side effects

2527
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:15,930
are things like excessive
alertness and insomnia

2528
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:17,690
if it's taken too late
in the day and so forth,

2529
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:21,070
but I encourage you to explore
that further if that's,

2530
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:22,614
if increasing free testosterone

2531
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:25,340
is something that you're
interested in doing.

2532
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:29,610
Examine.com includes a lot of other things

2533
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:31,960
that can increase testosterone,

2534
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,350
one of the things that's been

2535
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:36,950
purported to free up
testosterone in the blood

2536
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:39,860
are things like nettles, stinging nettles,

2537
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,530
although I should point
out that the literature

2538
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,530
points to stinging nettle

2539
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:45,160
also having some fairly potent effects

2540
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,200
on the prostate and on the liver,

2541
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,070
and so it might be a tricky molecule

2542
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:52,320
and maybe not an attractive
one for people to take.

2543
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,490
So we talked about creatine,
we talked about tongkat ali,

2544
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:57,410
it's clear that boron,
which is really interesting,

2545
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:59,550
believe it or not, I
think boron comes from,

2546
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:02,610
I think these were like,
meteors that landed on Earth

2547
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:04,063
and now they extract boron,

2548
01:44:04,988 --> 01:44:07,450
it's one of these crazy stories
that, when you look at it,

2549
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:08,710
you go like, "How could that possibly be?"

2550
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,070
but there's actually, that's how it works,

2551
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:14,810
that boron, there's
some scientific support

2552
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:16,520
for it freeing up more testosterone,

2553
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,760
and again, freeing up testosterone

2554
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:19,330
may be exactly what you want,

2555
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:20,610
I just don't think that we should

2556
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:23,900
demonize these carrier
proteins like albumin and SHBG,

2557
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:25,830
in fact, albumin is very important

2558
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:28,330
for testosterone to be able
to make it into the brain

2559
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:31,460
to have some of the pro-androgenic effects

2560
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,630
on the cognitive effects of testosterone

2561
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:35,110
because in both males and females,

2562
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:39,383
testosterone can shift these
behaviors, like mate-seeking,

2563
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:43,330
reductions in anxiety, and so forth,

2564
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:44,800
that we talked about before,

2565
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,997
only by making it into the brain,

2566
01:44:45,997 --> 01:44:48,510
and there is this thing called
the blood-brain barrier,

2567
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:49,720
which is fascinating

2568
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:51,890
and deserving of an entire episode also,

2569
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,880
and getting molecules across
the blood-brain barrier,

2570
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,137
even if they're sex steroid
hormones, which are lipophilic

2571
01:44:57,137 --> 01:45:00,840
and can pass through cell
membranes, requires carriers,

2572
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,640
and those carriers often are
bound to or include albumin,

2573
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:10,640
and so it's not the goal to
free up all your testosterone,

2574
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:13,180
but getting free testosterone into a range

2575
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,620
that works for your
particular goals and needs

2576
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:17,210
is an attractive one,

2577
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:19,740
and that's why we're discussing
these particular tools.

2578
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:21,710
The amounts of boron that people take,

2579
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:24,330
and you can find this,
again, on PubMed or Examine,

2580
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:26,450
but people take a couple
grams of it a day,

2581
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:28,160
I'm not aware of any
specific side effects,

2582
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:30,290
but you always, always,
always want to examine

2583
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:32,010
for the particular side effects

2584
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,630
and people with different
backgrounds and conditions,

2585
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:37,140
as we talked about for
menopause and estrogen,

2586
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,140
have to be careful

2587
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:40,930
because when you're starting
to modulate hormones,

2588
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:44,080
you're starting to modulate
not just the tissues

2589
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,930
that thrive on binding of those hormones,

2590
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:51,270
but remember, the reason why
there's so much breast cancer

2591
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:53,370
and there's a reason why there's
so much testicular cancer

2592
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:57,270
is that any tissue that
undergoes rapid reproduction

2593
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:58,280
of particular cells,

2594
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:00,700
so there's a lot of reproduction of cells

2595
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:01,930
in shedding of uterine lining

2596
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:04,460
and the reproduction of
cells and eggs in the ovary,

2597
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,300
and in the testes, there's the production

2598
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:09,270
of Leydig and sertoli cells,

2599
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:12,710
and there's this kind of
ongoing production of sperm,

2600
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:15,490
that's why those tissues
are particularly vulnerable

2601
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:16,680
to the development of cancers,

2602
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,910
and many of those cancers
are androgen-sensitive,

2603
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:21,280
that's why one of the major treatments

2604
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,770
for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer

2605
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:26,770
is to give anti-androgenic drugs, okay?

2606
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:29,850
It's not just to shut down all things

2607
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:33,070
related to being androgenized,

2608
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,760
it's really about trying
to prevent testosterone

2609
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,700
from encouraging growth of tumors,

2610
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:41,590
so I want to really
emphasize the caution there

2611
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,520
because it's easy when thinking

2612
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,800
about optimizing estrogen and testosterone

2613
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,520
to just think, oh, more is better,

2614
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,970
more is definitely not better,

2615
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:50,750
and it's not just because
they can aromatize

2616
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:52,440
or convert into other things,

2617
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,120
it's because cancers,

2618
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,810
or any tissue that has a
lot of turnover of cells,

2619
01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:00,360
is going to thrive on androgen,

2620
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,610
anything that promotes growth

2621
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:03,570
is going to thrive on estrogen,

2622
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:05,790
remember, brain tissue
doesn't turn over that much,

2623
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:07,690
there isn't really much
production of new neurons,

2624
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:09,640
brain cancers happen but
they're kind of rare,

2625
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,650
and when they do happen,

2626
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:11,950
they tend to be glial cells,

2627
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:13,560
which have a lot of proliferation,

2628
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,970
glial cells can proliferate,

2629
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,120
adult neurons don't
create more of themselves,

2630
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,990
they don't create more neurons,

2631
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:21,890
in general, except in a few
places in the brain and body,

2632
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:26,890
so any tissue that recycles
itself is prone to cancers,

2633
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:31,300
and those tissues thrive
on androgens and estrogens

2634
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:32,630
to create more tumor,

2635
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:34,090
so you have to be careful

2636
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:35,600
anytime you're modulating hormones,

2637
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,450
especially androgens and estrogens,

2638
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:40,040
and in my scouring of the literature

2639
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:41,860
and looking at kind of what's out there

2640
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:43,900
and what people are talking about,

2641
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:46,730
and I also mean in the
scientific literature,

2642
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:49,890
one of the things that
is new to me, anyway,

2643
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:54,440
probably not new to a lot
of the gym rats out there,

2644
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,510
or the people that spend a
lot of time on YouTube videos

2645
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:58,850
talking about androgens,

2646
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:01,570
are these, forgive me for
butchering the name again,

2647
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:03,670
are these ecdysteroids,

2648
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:08,400
so ecdysteroids are molecules

2649
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,130
that come from things like
spinach, believe it or not,

2650
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:16,470
that have a lot of similarity
to the cholesterol molecule,

2651
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:19,260
the one that's being discussed
a lot out there right now

2652
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,900
is something called turkesterone,

2653
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,560
I wish I knew why it
was called turkesterone,

2654
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:25,050
someone tell me why it's
called turkesterone,

2655
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:27,400
does it have anything to do with turkeys?

2656
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,500
I don't know why it's called turkesterone,

2657
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,340
perhaps someone will know.

2658
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,120
In any case, these ecdysteroids

2659
01:48:35,043 --> 01:48:36,890
are similar enough to cholesterol,

2660
01:48:36,890 --> 01:48:39,340
and remember, cholesterol is the precursor

2661
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:42,080
to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen,

2662
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:45,840
and it appears that some
of these ecdysteroids

2663
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,110
do have bioavailability,

2664
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:50,000
or their metabolites are bioavailable,

2665
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,660
and this was something
that, for many years,

2666
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:55,250
people talked about whether
or not insect hormones

2667
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,780
or hormones from other species

2668
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,980
could actually be used by humans

2669
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:01,370
or whether or not it would
have any effect at all,

2670
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:03,510
and it's pretty clear based on a study

2671
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:04,450
that I was able to find,

2672
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:07,020
there's a paper that came out in 2019,

2673
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:11,160
it's a comparative study in
the "Archives of Toxicology,"

2674
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:15,960
this is Isenmann et al.,
I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al.,

2675
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,890
that talks about the ecdysteroids

2676
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:20,580
and it was given in conjunction

2677
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:22,930
with strength training
or no strength training,

2678
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:24,360
this was a 10-week intervention,

2679
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:27,570
and their conclusion is
that these ecdysteroids

2680
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:31,400
had a fairly significant,
above placebo controls,

2681
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:35,000
increases in muscle mass,
strength, hypertrophy effects,

2682
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,060
all the sorts of things
that one would expect

2683
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:39,570
with increases in androgen,

2684
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:43,590
their conclusion of this
study is not my conclusion,

2685
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:45,320
although I may or may not agree with them,

2686
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,570
this isn't about my opinions,

2687
01:49:46,570 --> 01:49:47,520
it's just, I want to be clear,

2688
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:48,990
these are their words, not mine,

2689
01:49:48,990 --> 01:49:52,710
but they say that, in their words,

2690
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:54,197
quote, "Our results strongly suggest

2691
01:49:54,197 --> 01:49:55,487
"the inclusion of ecdysteroid

2692
01:49:55,487 --> 01:49:56,960
"in the list of prohibited substances."

2693
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,620
So they're saying these
things are so powerful

2694
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:00,280
that they should be on the
list of banned substances,

2695
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:04,370
which might be upsetting to some,

2696
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:07,430
or some of you might be
thinking, well, who cares?

2697
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:12,430
The whole issue of
augmenting hormones in sports

2698
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,650
is a very interesting issue,

2699
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,940
in fact, if you just want a
little anecdote about that,

2700
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:18,890
I can't reveal names here, of course,

2701
01:50:18,890 --> 01:50:21,910
but what I learned recently
was very surprising to me

2702
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:24,900
which is that many athletes in pro sports

2703
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:27,040
are taking testosterone,

2704
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,600
and they are able to do that legally

2705
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,540
not just because it's
available by prescription,

2706
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:33,890
but they are allowed to do that

2707
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:35,880
under the rules of their sport

2708
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:38,830
in the fine print that no one,
including me, had ever seen,

2709
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,170
if they've had an injury,

2710
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:44,010
so if athletes are injured,
then it opens up the door

2711
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:47,600
for certain forms of
testosterone augmentation

2712
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,500
and other types of augmentations

2713
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,790
that are not available to
them if they're not injured,

2714
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:54,180
which always makes me wonder now

2715
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:55,210
when I see them getting injured

2716
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:57,700
whether or not that's an attempt
to get some of the support

2717
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:00,100
because there's absolutely no question

2718
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:04,020
that estrogens and testosterones
modulate gene expression,

2719
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,420
modulate strength, modulate
the way the brain works,

2720
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:09,710
modulates our relationship to
effort and anxiety, et cetera,

2721
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:11,850
and while we're talking
about supplementation,

2722
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:13,423
the effects of supplementation,

2723
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,150
I would say, in some individuals
can be quite dramatic,

2724
01:51:17,150 --> 01:51:19,733
but they're always, always, always,

2725
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:25,000
except in extreme cases,
going to be far subtler,

2726
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,520
excuse me, far more subtle,

2727
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,960
to use the proper English,

2728
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,630
far more subtle than would be,

2729
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:34,590
for instance, just in
injecting testosterone

2730
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:36,820
or injecting estrogen, et cetera,

2731
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:40,053
so I think we should just be
honest and upfront about that.

2732
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:45,040
So thus far in terms of talking
about optimizing hormones

2733
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,453
and in the discussion of supplementation,

2734
01:51:48,510 --> 01:51:49,830
I haven't really talked about things

2735
01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:51,760
that actually affect the brain directly,

2736
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,820
that increase the pituitary
output and things of that sort,

2737
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:55,930
we've mainly been talking about things

2738
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:58,750
that free up testosterone
or that increase estrogen

2739
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,630
at the level of the periphery,

2740
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:01,720
but if you remember way back

2741
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,050
to the beginning of this episode,

2742
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:05,160
hormones are made in different
locations in the body

2743
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,730
and there are hormones

2744
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:09,410
that promote the release and
the production of hormones

2745
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:10,490
from other tissues in the body,

2746
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:12,640
and one of the main hormones for that

2747
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,160
is luteinizing hormone,

2748
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,370
luteinizing hormone, again,
comes from the pituitary,

2749
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:18,870
circulates and either goes to the ovary

2750
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:23,870
to promote various
aspects of egg maturation

2751
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,700
as well as production of estrogen,

2752
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,130
and to the testes to promote

2753
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:31,740
testosterone and sperm production,

2754
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:35,400
and the prescription version

2755
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,010
of increasing luteinizing hormone

2756
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:40,760
is something called hCG, or
human chorionic gonadotropin,

2757
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:41,950
which has been synthesized

2758
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:44,520
and is now available
as a prescription drug,

2759
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:48,920
it's taken in various contexts
for increasing fertility

2760
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,080
both by males and by females,

2761
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,710
it can increase, for all the
reasons that now make sense,

2762
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:56,060
it can increase sperm production,

2763
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:59,040
it can produce ovulation frequency,

2764
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,150
it can produce the number of eggs, even,

2765
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:03,690
that are deployed in a given ovulation,

2766
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:06,470
although that's not always a good thing,

2767
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:08,910
it basically is pro-fertility,

2768
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:11,070
pro-testosterone, pro-estrogen

2769
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:12,980
depending on your background,

2770
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:15,920
and what's interesting is

2771
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,600
hCG was initially synthesized,

2772
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:22,260
collected and synthesized
from pregnant women's urine,

2773
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:27,040
and believe it or not, before
it was synthetically made

2774
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,760
and sold as a prescription drug,

2775
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:33,600
there was actually a black
market for pregnant women's urine

2776
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,300
where people would buy the urine,

2777
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,870
I don't know, I'm guessing
that they probably

2778
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:40,620
just consumed it, which is weird,

2779
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:44,220
but in any case, human
chorionic gonadotropin

2780
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:46,360
is now available as a prescription drug

2781
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:48,580
and it's one of the things
that many people use

2782
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:51,210
to increase testosterone or estrogen

2783
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:52,640
for increasing fertility,

2784
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,020
in some cases I think it's used

2785
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:55,800
to increase sports performance

2786
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:59,150
or when people have shut down their gonads

2787
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:01,990
for whatever reason because
of excessive hormone therapies

2788
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:05,030
or they have some sort of,

2789
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:07,630
sometimes there are actually
lesions to the pituitary,

2790
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:10,250
sometimes people have a
tumor in the pituitary,

2791
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:11,960
it's actually not common,

2792
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,350
but among brain tumors and neural tumors,

2793
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:15,960
it's one of the more common ones,

2794
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:18,217
and then you get
deficiencies in LH and FSH,

2795
01:54:18,217 --> 01:54:20,950
and so people will take hCG
to stimulate the gonads,

2796
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:21,940
so there are a variety of reasons

2797
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,870
why these drugs were created,

2798
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:26,440
but there are certain
supplements, not many,

2799
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:29,020
that apparently can
increase luteinizing hormone

2800
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,010
and thereby can increase
testosterone and estrogen,

2801
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:36,360
and one of the more well-documented
one is Fadogia agrestis,

2802
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:39,160
that's F-A-D-O-G-I-A,

2803
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:42,930
separate word, A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,

2804
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:45,960
which, at least according
to the literature

2805
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:47,070
that I was able to find,

2806
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:49,120
can increase levels of luteinizing hormone

2807
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:52,490
and thereby levels of testosterone
or levels of estrogen,

2808
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:55,960
and again, if an individual
were to take Fadogia agrestis,

2809
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:57,050
what they would probably find

2810
01:54:57,050 --> 01:55:00,000
is that testosterone and
estrogen would increase

2811
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,360
in anyone of any chromosomal
or gonadal background,

2812
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,620
but remember, it's the ratio of both,

2813
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:08,450
if someone has low estrogen
and high testosterone,

2814
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:10,300
let's say they have testes
just by way of example,

2815
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:13,370
then both of those would
be expected to increase,

2816
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:15,860
and if someone has high
estrogen and low testosterone,

2817
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:17,930
and let's just say has ovaries,

2818
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:19,570
then both of those would increase

2819
01:55:19,570 --> 01:55:22,000
by taking Fadogia agrestis.

2820
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,290
The side effect profile
of Fadogia agrestis

2821
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:26,100
hasn't really been documented,

2822
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:27,580
so it's a little unclear,

2823
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:29,380
I just want to emphasize

2824
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:32,323
that anytime someone's going
to start taking supplements,

2825
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,940
or modifying sex steroid hormones,

2826
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:38,780
getting blood work done
is extremely important

2827
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:39,700
for safety reasons,

2828
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,130
and also just to know whether
or not things are working,

2829
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:43,900
and because all of these things

2830
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:45,880
are subject to negative feedback,

2831
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:48,740
talked about this previously
on a previous episode,

2832
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:51,610
but if testosterone
goes high, or too high,

2833
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:54,350
it can feed back and shut
down luteinizing hormone,

2834
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:57,250
which will then shut down
further testosterone production,

2835
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:59,620
likewise, if estrogens are going too high

2836
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:02,190
or they're going too high at
various phases of the cycle,

2837
01:56:02,190 --> 01:56:05,490
that can start to throw
off various other hormones,

2838
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:09,940
including FSH, progesterone, LH,

2839
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,180
the menstrual cycle itself

2840
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,840
is a just absolutely exquisite balance

2841
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,530
of feedback of luteinizing
hormone kept low and constant,

2842
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:19,850
at least for the first
14 days of the cycle,

2843
01:56:19,850 --> 01:56:21,400
then mid cycle, there's a peak,

2844
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,220
and that's typically
when ovulation occurs,

2845
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,990
that's why pregnancy is most likely

2846
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:28,170
during the middle of the 28-day cycle,

2847
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:33,160
FSH kind of goes up and then
down across the first 14 days,

2848
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:36,160
so taking anything or really modifying

2849
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:38,270
one's estrogens or testosterone

2850
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:40,410
on that background of the menstrual cycle

2851
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,830
is really going to disrupt
the way those things interact,

2852
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:45,140
and it's just such an
exquisite feedback loop,

2853
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:48,230
so I'm not saying don't do that,

2854
01:56:48,230 --> 01:56:50,880
but you definitely want to be
aware of what you're doing,

2855
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,900
and blood draws are one way to do that,

2856
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:55,820
monitoring cycles for ovulating females

2857
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,730
is another way to do that,

2858
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:58,950
and in males, having a good window

2859
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:01,290
into what's going on
with testosterone, DHT,

2860
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:05,510
aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera,

2861
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:06,490
is just vital,

2862
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:09,790
and it's really part and
parcel with the practice

2863
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:12,390
of thinking about optimizing
these incredible things

2864
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,980
that we call sex steroid hormones,

2865
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:16,380
estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives.

2866
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:18,630
The list of supplements and molecules

2867
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:22,250
that can adjust estrogen
and testosterone is vast,

2868
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:24,280
and I only touched on a few of these,

2869
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,040
I really tried to emphasize the ones

2870
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:29,310
for which there are human studies

2871
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:32,670
or that have mostly human studies,

2872
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,350
or maybe even just one human study,

2873
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:36,740
there are other things out there

2874
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,170
for which there are scientific data,

2875
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:39,780
things like Bulbine natalensis,

2876
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:42,980
which definitely has support
for increasing testosterone

2877
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:45,220
but all the studies were in rats,

2878
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:46,810
I think there is some evidence in humans

2879
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,700
but the evidence mainly comes in the form

2880
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:50,690
of what we call sponsored research,

2881
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:52,820
so companies paying for research,

2882
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:54,900
which is different than
independent research

2883
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:58,380
by people who are not biased
in terms of the outcome,

2884
01:57:58,380 --> 01:57:59,520
and the reason I didn't

2885
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,250
throw out things like Bulbine natalensis

2886
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:04,120
is they seem to have liver toxicity

2887
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:08,270
similar to high levels of
anabolic exogenous steroids,

2888
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:10,600
there's some problems associated with them

2889
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:14,750
that make them, you know,
important to think about

2890
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:18,390
if you're curious about this
area and the endocrinology,

2891
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:21,410
but also somewhat precarious,

2892
01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:23,760
and you know, that's one category,

2893
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,110
so stuff that doesn't have
a lot of evidence in humans,

2894
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:28,610
might actually be dangerous,

2895
01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:30,380
the other category of things

2896
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:34,030
that has been shown to improve levels of,

2897
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:36,020
or increase, I should say,
I don't want to say improve

2898
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:36,853
because it's up to you whether or not

2899
01:58:36,853 --> 01:58:39,700
you want to increase or decrease
estrogen and testosterone,

2900
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:41,860
that's highly individual,
how could I know,

2901
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:43,800
are the things that are
kind of housekeeping

2902
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,870
for production of
estrogen and testosterone,

2903
01:58:45,870 --> 01:58:49,910
things like magnesium, things
like D3, things like zinc,

2904
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:50,930
you know, those are the things

2905
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:54,880
that are going to create an overall milieu

2906
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,470
of opportunity to produce
normal endogenous levels

2907
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:01,740
rather than increasing
endogenous levels further,

2908
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:03,580
and so I really want to highlight

2909
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:05,210
that there's a difference
between taking something

2910
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:08,620
to create a kind of
backdrop of general support

2911
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:11,770
and taking something that's
going to create a big inflection

2912
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,080
in the levels of a given hormone.

2913
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,210
So once again, we covered

2914
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:17,350
a tremendous amount of information,

2915
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:20,700
we covered some basic science
of hormones and pheromones,

2916
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:23,380
estrogen and testosterone
and their derivatives,

2917
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:26,440
we talked about
supplementation and behaviors,

2918
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,250
competition and parenting,

2919
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:30,330
and how all these things interact,

2920
01:59:30,330 --> 01:59:32,590
and I hope that you'll come away from this

2921
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:34,660
with a deeper mechanistic understanding

2922
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:37,530
of how the brain and body are interacting

2923
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:39,590
to control the output

2924
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:42,750
and the ways in which
these incredible things

2925
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:45,960
that we call sex steroid
hormones work and influence us,

2926
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:47,640
I hope you'll also come
away with some ideas

2927
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:48,910
of things that you can do,

2928
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:52,490
in particular, behavioral
practices that can improve sleep

2929
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:54,760
and your relationship to light, et cetera,

2930
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:57,850
because those things
really set the foundation

2931
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:01,600
not just for healthy
steroid hormone output,

2932
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,700
but for all sorts of health effects

2933
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:08,010
and for both the
psychology and the biology

2934
02:00:08,010 --> 02:00:09,980
of your nervous system,

2935
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:12,010
so I'm sure there'll be many questions,

2936
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:14,836
there are many things that
I couldn't get to today,

2937
02:00:14,836 --> 02:00:17,040
I do try and limit these
episodes to about 90 minutes,

2938
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:20,840
which is the optimal
ultradian cycle for learning,

2939
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,790
it's a lot of information,

2940
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,410
but we've timestamped everything for you,

2941
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:26,440
so feel free to look over it in parts

2942
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:29,550
or circle back where you might
want deeper understanding,

2943
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:32,700
and please put your questions
in the comments section below,

2944
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:35,370
please put suggestions for future episodes

2945
02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:36,970
and things that relate to hormones

2946
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:39,510
in the comments section
below, we do look at those

2947
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:41,770
and we do use them to inform the content

2948
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:43,570
for subsequent episodes.

2949
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:45,900

that really helps us grow our audience

2959
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:09,020
and bring more information to you.

2960
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:11,170
As well, please check out our sponsors

2961
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:13,370
mentioned at the
beginning of each episode,

2962
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:15,220
and we also have a Patreon,

2963
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:18,838
that's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2964
02:01:18,838 --> 02:01:21,040
At the Patreon, you can
help support the podcast

2965
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,080
at any level that you like.

2966
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:27,860
As well, we've partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2967
02:01:27,860 --> 02:01:29,290
which is a supplement company,

2968
02:01:29,290 --> 02:01:30,253
the reason we partner with Thorne

2969
02:01:30,253 --> 02:01:32,620
is that they have the
highest levels of stringency

2970
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:35,610
in terms of the quality of
the supplements that they make

2971
02:01:35,610 --> 02:01:37,790
and the quantity of the
individual ingredients,

2972
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:40,140
something that's not always the case

2973
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:41,620
with various supplement companies,

2974
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,660
but Thorne is exquisitely good

2975
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:45,470
about the stringency of their products,

2976
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:46,900
they partner with the Mayo Clinic

2977
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:48,880
and all the major sports teams.

2978
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,050
If you want to check out Thorne

2979
02:01:50,050 --> 02:01:51,630
and see the supplements that I take,

2980
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:56,180
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,

2981
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:58,370
and if you do that, you can
see the supplements I take,

2982
02:01:58,370 --> 02:02:00,980
but as well, it will
allow you to get 20% off

2983
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:01,990
any of those supplements

2984
02:02:01,990 --> 02:02:04,670
or any of the other
supplements that Thorne makes,

2985
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:07,173
that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2986
02:02:08,097 --> 02:02:11,430
.com/u/huberman

2987
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:14,180
to get 20% off any Thorne supplements.

2988
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:16,540
In closing, I hope you'll
leave today's episode

2989
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:19,270
with a much richer
understanding of the mechanisms

2990
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:21,360
that control the endocrine
and nervous system

2991
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:24,080
in the context of
estrogen and testosterone,

2992
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,030
as well as take away various tools

2993
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:28,140
that you might choose to apply,

2994
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:31,290
and next week, we'll be
back with another episode

2995
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:32,660
about the role of hormones

2996
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:35,677
and its important interactions
with the nervous system,

2997
02:02:35,677 --> 02:02:36,770
and that will, of course,

2998
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:39,740
include both mechanisms and tools as well,

2999
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:42,317
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
