00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,970
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,770
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,963
and science based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,280
I'm Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,840
and I'm a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,000
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,850
Today, we are going to discuss the use

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,500
of deliberate cold exposure

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,540
for health and performance.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,730
Temperature is a powerful
stimulus on our nervous system

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,810
and indeed on every organ
and system of our body

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,500
and cold in particular can be leveraged

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,220
to improve mental health,
physical health, and performance,

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,370
meaning for endurance
exercise, for recovering

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,230
from various forms of exercise,

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,480
for actually improving strength and power

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,930
and for enhancing mental capacity.

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,960
In order to properly leverage
deliberate cold exposure

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,300
for sake of mental health,
physical health and performance,

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,280
you have to understand how cold
impacts the brain and body.

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,330
So today we are going to discuss that.

22
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,080
We're going to talk about
some of the neural circuits

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,650
and pathways, some of
the hormones involved.

24
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,070
I promise to make it
all clear and accessible

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,190
regardless of whether or not

26
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,530
you have a scientific background or not.

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,080
We are also going to discuss
very specific protocols

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,200
that you can apply,

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
which leverage variables like temperature,

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,540
how cold, how to deliver
the cold, for instance,

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,160
whether or not you use a cold shower,

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,980
cold immersion, ice bath,
circulating water, or still water,

33
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,920
whether or not you're going
for walks outside in a t-shirt

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,490
when it's cold or whether or not

35
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,120
you're purposefully
using things like cryo,

36
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,400
if you have access to that or not.

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,360
One thing I can promise you

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,540
is that by the end of today's episode,

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,630
you will know a lot about the
biology of thermal regulation,

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,000
that is how your brain and
body regulates its temperature.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,380
You will also have a lot
of tools in your arsenal

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,170
that you can use and leverage

43
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,960
toward improving mental health,

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,380
physical health, reducing
inflammation in the body,

45
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,210
improving athletic performance,

46
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,850
improving mental performance.

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,580
I promise to spell out all
those protocols in detail

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,520
as I go along and to summarize
them again at the end.

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,750
I'd like to make a point
now that I'm going to make

50
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,560
several additional times
during today's episode

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,180
and that is that temperature
is a very potent stimulus

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,750
for the brain and body.

53
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,410
That also means that it
carries certain hazards

54
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,130
if it's not done correctly.

55
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,040
Now, everyone shows up to the table,

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,380
meaning to protocols,

57
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,420
with a different
background of health status

58
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,190
and there's simply no way that I can know

59
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,790
what your health status is.

60
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,290
So anytime you are going
to take on a new protocol,

61
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,730
that means a behavioral protocol
or a nutritional protocol

62
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,510
or a supplementation protocol,

63
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,610
you should absolutely consult
a board certified physician

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,110
before initiating that protocol.

65
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,380
I don't just say this to protect us,

66
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,700
I also say this to protect you.

67
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,500
If you'd like to see
our medical disclaimer,

68
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,700
you can go to our show
notes, it's described there.

69
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,930
In fact, I encourage
you to please do that.

70
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,240
And in general,

71
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,500
when embarking on new
protocols in particular,

72
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,460
if they involve strong stimuli
like changing temperature

73
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,730
or placing yourself into
unusual temperatures,

74
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,920
I would encourage you
to progress gradually.

75
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,260
I would also encourage you to not look at

76
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,010
gradual progression as
the kind of weak version

77
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,080
of a protocol.

78
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,600
In fact, today I'm going to discuss

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,940
a really beautiful peer reviewed study

80
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,440
that involved having people
do deliberate cold exposure

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,500
so they were immersing
themselves into water

82
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,850
up to about their neck

83
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,780
and the water was actually not that cold.

84
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,570
It was only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit,

85
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,460
which for most people is pretty tolerable.

86
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,120
So nowhere near the kinds
of extreme temperatures

87
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,320
that one could use in other protocols.

88
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,080
And the interesting thing is despite

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,010
that fairly modest cold temperature,

90
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,910
by simply extending the duration of time

91
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,420
that people were in that water,

92
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,530
they experienced enormous
increases in neurochemicals

93
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,540
that ought to translate to
improvements in focus and mood.

94
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,650
And indeed, that's what's been observed

95
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,570
in subsequent studies.

96
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,680
So again, please see
our medical disclaimer

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,770
in our show notes, please
proceed with caution always,

98
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,650
please also understand that
the most potent stimulus

99
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,540
isn't always the one that you experience

100
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,270
as the most intense in the moment.

101
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,910
In fact, I would encourage you to you find

102
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,440
the minimum threshold of stimulus

103
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,170
that will allow you to
drive the maximum benefit

104
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,030
from each protocol and indeed,

105
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,580
I will point out what those
thresholds ought to be today.

106
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,450
I'll give you some simple formulas,

107
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,660
gauges or guides that you
can use in order to navigate

108
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,410
this extremely interesting and potent tool

109
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,519
that we call deliberate cold exposure.

110
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,390
Before we talk about
deliberate cold exposure

111
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,910
and its many powerful applications,

112
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,210
I'd like to highlight a study

113
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,890
that I find particularly interesting,

114
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,380
that I think you will find

115
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,940
particularly interesting and useful.

116
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,340
The title of this study
is brief aerobic exercise

117
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,860
immediately enhances
visual attentional control

118
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,480
and perceptual speed,

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,480
testing the mediated role
of feelings of energy.

120
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,930
Now, the reason I like
this study is first of all,

121
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,980
it's a fairly large size sample group.

122
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,320
They looked at 101 students.

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,740
These were college-aged students
and they had two groups.

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,740
One group did 15 minutes of
jogging at moderate intensity.

125
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,600
So they did measure percent
heart rates, et cetera,

126
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,460
but this would be analogous
to zone two cardio,

127
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,420
which I've discussed
on this podcast before.

128
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,290
Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise

129
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,260
that places you at a level where
you can hold a conversation

130
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,100
with a little bit of strain,

131
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,480
meaning that you can get the words out,

132
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,440
but every once in a while
you have to catch your breath

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,020
whereas if you were to push
any harder by any mechanism

134
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,060
going faster or on a
steeper incline, et cetera,

135
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,840
that you would have a hard time
carrying out a conversation.

136
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,840
So zone two cardio is a
common form of describing

137
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,660
that level of intensity that
they call moderate intensity.

138
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,320
So one group did 15 minute of
jogging at moderate intensity,

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,820
which I'm translating to
roughly zone two cardio.

140
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,040
The other group did 15 minutes
of relaxation concentration

141
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,320
that is somewhat akin to
mindfulness meditation.

142
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,000
And then they were analyzed
for perceptual speed,

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,750
visual attentional control,
something called working memory,

144
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,583
which is your ability

145
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:06,490
to keep certain batches
of information online.

146
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,930
Just imagine someone telling
you their phone number,

147
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,800
and you have to remember
that sequence of numbers

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,980
in your head for some period
of time, that's working memory.

149
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,920
And it depends very
heavily on the so-called

150
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,010
prefrontal cortical networks,

151
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,010
which are involved in planning and action.

152
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,140
And they also looked at
people's feelings of energy

153
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,460
and they measured that subjectively,

154
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,100
how energetic people felt.

155
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,010
Now the major takeaways from this study

156
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,230
that I'd like to emphasize are that

157
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,630
the 15 minutes of jogging group

158
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,320
experienced elevated levels of energy

159
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,930
for some period of time after
they ceased the exercise

160
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,810
whereas the group that
did mindfulness meditation

161
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,150
actually reported feeling more calm

162
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,770
and having less overall energy.

163
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,730
Now that's very subjective
and indeed they used

164
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,080
subjective measures to analyze energy,

165
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,060
but what gets interesting is
when they looked at performance

166
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,760
on these various cognitive
tasks and the two tasks

167
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,380
that they use were called
the trail making tests,

168
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,700
they have different versions of this,

169
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,870
version A, version B,

170
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,730
I don't want to go into too much detail,

171
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,960
but version A essentially
involves having a page of numbers

172
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,900
that are distributed somewhat randomly.

173
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,260
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight and so on,

174
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,950
but distributed randomly across the page

175
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,580
and people have to use visual search

176
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,510
to circle those numbers in sequence.

177
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,050
So this involves visual attention,

178
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,540
it involves some motor skills,

179
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,420
involves a number of things

180
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,240
that certainly require energy and focus.

181
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,320
The second test was the
trail making test part B,

182
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,230
as I mentioned earlier,

183
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,040
and this involved also
circling numbers in sequence,

184
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
but interspersed between
those numbers were letters.

185
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,910
So rather than just having

186
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,810
to circle off numbers in sequence,

187
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,620
they actually had to connect one,

188
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,167
then the letter A, then two,
then the letter B, et cetera

189
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:47,440
and remember these are randomly
distributed across the page.

190
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,120
The major takeaway from the
study is that the group that did

191
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,120
the 15 minutes of moderate
exercise prior to these two tests

192
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,770
showed significant decreases
in the amount of time required

193
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,380
to complete these tests accurately.

194
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,330
That is interesting and indeed
surprising at least to me,

195
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,130
because there have been many
studies looking at the effects

196
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,200
of mindfulness meditation
on the ability to focus.

197
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,010
The key variable in the study
turned out to be energy.

198
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,600
This subjectively measured
feeling I should say

199
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,860
of having more energy and
thereby the ability to focus,

200
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,770
especially in these high
cognitive demand tasks.

201
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,470
Now the takeaway from
this study for all of us

202
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,330
I think is pretty straightforward.

203
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,170
If you are going to sit
down to do some work

204
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,570
that requires focus and working memory

205
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,620
and cognitive attention

206
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,840
and especially if it's some
visual spatial control,

207
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,460
meaning you have to search
for things on a page,

208
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,850
you have to organize things on a page,

209
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,460
so some writing, arithmetic,

210
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,650
basically cognitive work of any kind,

211
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,700
15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior

212
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,590
to that work about could
be very beneficial for you.

213
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,930
This does not mean that
mindfulness meditation

214
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,400
would not be a benefit to you.

215
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,250
I wouldn't want you to conclude that,

216
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,940
but if you had to choose between doing

217
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,890
15 minutes of mindfulness meditation

218
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,850
and doing 15 minutes of moderate exercise

219
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,680
prior to a cognitive work about,

220
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,300
I would say the 15 minutes
of moderate exercise would be

221
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,270
more valuable at least based
on the data in this paper.

222
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,007
In many previous podcasts,

223
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:17,750
I have talked about the
powerful effects of doing things

224
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,890
like mindfulness meditation,
and other forms of NSDR,

225
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,000
non-sleep deep rest.

226
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,840
So these could be 20 minute
naps or just lying there quietly

227
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,000
with your eyes closed or yoga nidra

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,510
or NSDR scripts are available on YouTube

229
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,660
and various other places
free of cost of any kind.

230
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,530
You just go to YouTube, put in NSDR,

231
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,683
non-sleep deep rest.

232
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,540
Those protocols have been
shown to be very beneficial

233
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,890
for enhancing neuroplasticity,

234
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,120
the changes in the brain
and body that encode

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,440
or shift the neural circuits that allow

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,700
for memory to change,

237
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,760
that allow for learning to
occur after a learning about.

238
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,490
What I'm referring to today
in this particular study

239
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,830
is the use of moderate exercise

240
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,950
in order to increase
one's focus and attention

241
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,800
in order to trigger that neuroplasticity.

242
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,223
So the simple sequence here
is get energetic and alert,

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,220
do that prior to the learning about,

244
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,370
engage in the cognitive
work or learning about,

245
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,330
and then mindfulness meditation,

246
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,700
NSDR and so forth should follow.

247
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,160
And if you would like to access this paper

248
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,710
and like to look more at
the details in the paper,

249
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,280
we'll be sure to put a
link in the show notes.

250
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,210
The first author is Legrand.

251
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,770
And again, the title of this
paper is brief aerobic exercise

252
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,840
immediately enhances
visual potential control

253
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,980
and perceptual speed,

254
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,540
testing the mediating
role of feeling of energy.

255
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,100
And I also just want to
emphasize immediately.

256
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,150
I think most people out
there are interested in tools

257
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,627
and protocols that work the first time

258
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,020
and that work every time

259
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,760
and indeed, I think this
protocol fits that bill.

260
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,593
I'm pleased to announce

261
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:51,420
that I'm hosting two live events this May.

262
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,950
The first live event will be hosted

263
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,630
in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

264
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,580
The second live event

265
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,630
will be hosted in Portland,
Oregon on May 18th,

266
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,640
both are part of a lecture series entitled

267
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,940
the Brain Body Contract during
which I will discuss science

268
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,100
and science-based tools for mental health,

269
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,577
physical health and performance.

270
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:11,320
And I should point out that
while some of the material

271
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,010
I'll cover will overlap with
information covered here

272
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,407
on the Huberman Lab Podcast

273
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,460
and on various social media posts,

274
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,610
most of the information I will
cover is going to be distinct

275
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,500
from information covered on
the podcast or elsewhere.

276
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,050
So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

277
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,370
Portland on May 18th.

278
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,480
You can access tickets by
going to hubermanlab.com/tour

279
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,950
and I hope to see you there.

280
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,783
Before we begin,

281
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:36,000
I'd like to emphasize that
this podcast is separate

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

283
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,410
It is however part of my desire and effort

284
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,120
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

285
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,810
and science-related tools
to the general public.

286
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,990
In keeping with that theme,

287
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,730
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

288
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,650
Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens, also called AG One.

289
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,590
I started taking AG One way back in 2012

290
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,010
so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.

291
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,690
The reason I started taking AG One

292
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,430
and the reason I still take AG One

293
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,690
once or twice a day is that it covers my

294
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,860
foundational vitamin
mineral and probiotic needs.

295
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,310
It also has adaptogens
and things like zinc

296
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,020
for immune system function,

297
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,780
but the probiotics are one
of the key features in there.

298
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,100
I've done several podcasts
on the gut microbiome,

299
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,940
which are these trillions of microbiota

300
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,450
that live in our digestive tract,

301
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,400
and that are crucial
for our immune system,

302
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,803
brain function and so on.

303
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,990
One way to enhance our gut microbiome

304
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,870
to ensure that it's
healthy is to make sure

305
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,390
that we get the correct
probiotics and Athletic Greens

306
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,330
has the correct prebiotics
and probiotics that ensure

307
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,960
a healthy gut microbiome.

308
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

309
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,210
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

310
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,530
to claim a special offer.

311
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,400
They'll give you five free
travel packs that make it

312
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,110
very easy to mix up Athletic Greens

313
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,980
while you're on the road.

314
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,480
So in the car and on the plane.

315
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,410
I should mention the
Athletic Greens is delicious.

316
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,243
I love the way it tastes.

317
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,655
I mix mine with some water

318
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:53,820
and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

319
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,010
The special offer is the
five free travel packs

320
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,930
plus a year supply of
vitamin D three, K two.

321
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,940
Vitamin D three has been
shown to be important

322
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,430
for a tremendous number
of biological functions.

323
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,840
Many of us who get sunlight
get enough vitamin D three,

324
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,930
many of us, even if we do get sunlight,

325
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,860
do not get enough vitamin D three.

326
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,870
So the year supply of vitamin
D three also has K two,

327
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,750
which is important for
cardiovascular function,

328
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,400
for calcium regulation.

329
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,060
Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

330
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,400
to get the five free travel packs

331
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,070
and the year supply of
vitamin D three, K two.

332
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,420
Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.

333
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,520
ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

334
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,580
that are the absolute highest quality.

335
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,490
The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers

336
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,860
from Stanford and everything
about their eye glasses

337
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,600
and sunglasses were designed
with performance in mind.

338
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,130
Now the glasses were initially designed

339
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,170
for athletic performance,

340
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,170
meaning they were designed

341
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,990
to be worn while cycling or running.

342
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,180
And indeed you can wear them
while cycling or running.

343
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,890
If you get sweaty, they
won't slip off your face.

344
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,723
They're very lightweight.

345
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,920
In fact, you hardly ever remember
that they're on your face,

346
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,880
at least I can't remember
that they're on my face.

347
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,190
I wear the sunglasses when I
drive, I wear readers at night,

348
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,230
but they're not just for
athletic performance.

349
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,690
They have a terrific aesthetic

350
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,160
so you could wear them to the office

351
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,060
or to work or to school, they look great.

352
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,970
Unlike a lot of high
performance sunglasses out there

353

361
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,040
Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.

362
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,170
Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

363
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,080
that are uniquely designed
to your sleep needs.

364
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,360
Everybody knows the importance
of sleep for mental health,

365
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,180
physical health, and performance,

366
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,280
but probably what everyone doesn't realize

367
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,650
is that you have unique sleep needs,

368
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,140
your body and indeed the way you sleep

369
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,720
need to be matched the correct mattress

370
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,770
in order to get the best possible sleep.

371
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,710
Helix understands that and
if you go to their website,

372
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,250
they have a brief two minute
quiz that anyone can take

373
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,560
that will match your body
type and sleep preferences

374
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,450
to the perfect mattress for you.

375
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,510
So they ask questions like,

376
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,140
do you sleep on your side,
your back of your stomach,

377
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,973
or maybe you don't know.

378
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,420
Do you tend to run hot
or cold through the night

379
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,660
or maybe you don't know?

380
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,170
I matched to the dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,

381
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,240
because I wanted a mattress

382
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,980
that wasn't too firm nor too soft

383
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,350
and I've been sleeping on that
mattress for over a year now,

384
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,040
it's the best sleep I've ever had.

385
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,770
So if you're interested in
upgrading your mattress,

386
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,300
go to helixsleep.com/huberman,

387
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,350
take their two minute sleep
quiz and they'll match you

388
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,680
to a customized mattress and
you'll get up to $200 off

389
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,980
any mattress order and two free pillows.

390
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,260
They have a 10 year warranty

391
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,160
and you get to try the mattress out

392
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,050
for a hundred nights risk free.

393
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,630
They'll even pick it up for
you if you don't like it

394
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,980
although I think you will like it.

395
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,180
I certainly love mine.

396
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,230
Again if you're interested,

397
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,750
go to helixsleep.com/huberman to get

398
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,600
up to $200 off your mattress
order and two free pillows.

399
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,580
Let's talk about the use of
cold for health and performance.

400
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,530
I confess I love this topic

401
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,630
because it takes me back
to my undergraduate years

402
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,570
when I worked in a laboratory
studying cold physiology,

403
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,660
its effects on the brain
and its effects the body.

404
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,010
And over the years,

405
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,780
I've always kept track of
the literature in this area

406
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,830
and indeed there have been
some tremendous discoveries,

407
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,810
both in animal models, so in
rodents like mice and rats,

408
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,570
but also in humans

409
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,100
and today we're going to
talk about both categories

410
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,650
of studies and I'll be careful
to point out when discoveries

411
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,920
were made in animal models

412
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,173
and when they were made in humans.

413
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,790
A key point when thinking about
the use of cold as a tool,

414
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,760
and the key point is that
you have a baseline level

415
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,510
of temperature that is varying,

416
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,480
changing across the 24 hour cycle.

417
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,270
So any use of deliberate cold exposure

418
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,160
is going to be super
imposed on that rhythm,

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,420
that circadian rhythm,
meaning that 24 hour rhythm.

420
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,750
The basic contour of your
circadian rhythm in temperature

421
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,550
is that approximately two hours
before the time you wake up

422
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,920
is your so-called temperature minimum.

423
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,400
So your temperature minimum is a time

424
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
within the 24 hour cycle

425
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,900
when your body temperature
is at its lowest.

426
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,240
So if you normally wake up around 6:00 AM,

427
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,400
your temperature minimum
is probably about 4:00 AM.

428
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,000
If you normally wake up at about 7:00 AM,

429
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,170
your temperature minimum
is probably about 5:00 AM.

430
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,210
It's not exactly two hours
before your wake up time,

431
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,250
it's approximately two hours
before your wake up time.

432
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,700
Now, as you go from
your temperature minimum

433
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,089
to the time in which
you're going to awake,

434
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,969
your temperature is rising slightly.

435
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,420
And then at the point where you wake up,

436
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,320
your temperature starts
to go up more sharply

437
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,910
and will continue to go up into the early

438
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:38,600
and sometimes even into
the late afternoon.

439
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,350
And then sometime in the
late afternoon and evening,

440
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,750
your temperature will start to decline.

441
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,710
And indeed, as you approach sleep,

442
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,210
your body temperature will drop

443
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,760
by anywhere from one to three degrees.

444
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,980
And in fact that decrease
in core body temperature

445
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,580
is important if not
essential for getting into

446
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,010
and staying in deep sleep.

447
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,830
So temperature rises with
waking, that's easy to remember.

448
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,590
It tends to continue to
rise throughout the day

449
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,310
and in the late afternoon and evening,

450
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,410
your temperature WILL start
to go down and the drop

451
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,850
in temperature actually
helps you access sleep.

452
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,310
That background or what we
call baseline circadian rhythm

453
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,160
in core body temperature
is important to remember

454
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,300
because it helps us frame both the effects

455
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,640
of deliberate cold
exposure and helps us frame

456
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,090
when you might want to use
deliberate cold exposure

457
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,600
in order to access specific states.

458
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,740
It also points to times
within the 24 hour cycle

459
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,830
when you might want to avoid
using deliberate cold exposure,

460
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,720
if your primary goal is to get to sleep.

461
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,590
So that's the circadian
rhythm in temperature.

462
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,570
Now I just briefly want to touch on

463
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,090
thermal regulation at the
level of body and the brain.

464
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,193
And this will be very
surprising to many of you.

465
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,510
Let's do what's called
a Gedanken experiment,

466
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,960
which is a thought experiment.

467
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,930
Let's say I send you
out into the desert heat

468
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,650
for a jog or a run and
it's very hot outside,

469
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,650
102 or 103 degrees, and you start to move,

470
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,260
you start to sweat

471
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,900
and of course your core
body temperature goes up.

472
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,890
Now, then I offer you a cold towel,

473
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,220
maybe a really, really cold towel

474
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,850
and this towel is saturated with water

475
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,517
so you could actually
squeeze the water out of that

476
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:26,360
and cool your body off.

477
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,430
And our Gedanken experiment
is for me to say okay,

478
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,480
where are you going to place the towel?

479
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,820
How are you going to cool yourself off?

480
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,910
And I'm guessing that
most of you would think

481
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,590
that the best way to cool yourself off

482
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,550
would be to drape that
towel over your head,

483
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,040
maybe your neck, over your torso,

484
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
that it would feel really, really good,

485
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,370
and it would cool you off.

486
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,260
Well, that's exactly the wrong approach

487
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,330
if you want to cool off.

488
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,100
And in fact, if you were
to use that approach,

489
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,620
your body temperature would
continue to increase even more.

490
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,300
Yes, even more than had you not placed

491
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,550
that cold towel on your
head or your torso.

492
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,500
And here is why.

493
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,420
Thermal regulation meaning
your brain and body's ability

494
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,960
to regulate your internal core temperature

495
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,390
is somewhat like a thermostat
and that thermostat

496
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,170
resides in your brain.

497
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,650
So if you think about the thermostat

498
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,680
in your home or apartment,

499
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,400
if it's too warm in your home or apartment

500
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,980
and you were to take a bag of ice

501
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,640
and to put it on that thermostat,

502
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,090
what would the thermostat do?

503
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,670
It would register the
environment as artificially cool.

504
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,670
It would think that the environment

505
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,980
was actually much colder than it is.

506
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,780
And so as a consequence,

507
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,040
it would trigger a mechanism

508
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,670
to further increase the
temperature in the room.

509
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,540
And you have such a thermostat as well.

510
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,550
It's called the medial preoptic
area of the hypothalamus.

511
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,180
The hypothalamus is a small
region of brain tissue

512
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,110
about over the roof of your mouth

513
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,230
and a little bit in front of that.

514
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,640
So it's basically right behind
your nose and over the roof

515
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,650
of your mouth and it's
a collection of neurons.

516
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,540
Those neurons have a lot
of different functions

517
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,530
that include things like
the control of aggression,

518
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,240
the control of sex behavior,

519
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,730
the control of temperature
regulation and so on.

520
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,850
The medial preoptic area
has connections with

521
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,290
the rest of the brain

522
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,090
or areas within the brain, I should say

523
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,510
and with many areas within the body,

524
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:26,130
it receives input from
receptors in our skin

525
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,600
and inside our body that
register temperature

526
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,320
and it acts as a thermostat.

527
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,580
So if the surface of
your body is made cool,

528
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,420
your medial preoptic
area will send signals

529
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,510
by way of hormones

530
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,600
and by way of chemicals that will serve

531
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,680
to heat your body up.

532
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,280
So what this means is that
if you want to cool down,

533
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,160
the last thing you want to
do is to bring a cold surface

534
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,600
of any kind, towel or splashing water,

535
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,540
to the majority of your body surface.

536
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,107
It might be very, very surprising to you.

537
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,930
And you might say, wait,
if I want to cool down,

538
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,980
I should jump into a cold lake
or something of that sort.

539
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,530
That's a different thing altogether.

540
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,510
What I'll tell you,

541
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,320
and we'll get into this
in more depth later,

542
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,220
is that if you really

543
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,360
want to cool down quickly and efficiently,

544
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,810
you should leverage particular portals,

545
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,210
meaning particular sites on your body

546
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,700
where heat can leave
your body more readily

547
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,130
and where cooling can have
a dramatic and fast impact

548
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,190
on your core body temperature,

549
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,440
can even save your life if
you're going hyperthermic.

550
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,670
We're going to talk more about
the specific protocols to reduce

551
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,640
core body temperature
for sake of performance

552
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,560
and avoiding hyperthermia
later in the episode.

553
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,620
Hyperthermia of course is a
very, very dangerous situation

554
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,270
because while your body can
drop in core temperature

555
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,860
somewhat and still be safe,

556
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,500
you can't really increase your
body temperature that much

557
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,050
before your brain starts to cook

558
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,080
and other organs start
to cook and by cook,

559
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,170
I mean the cells actually start to die.

560
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,950
So you have to be very, very
careful with the use of heat.

561
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,460
Heat stroke is no joke.

562
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,310
People die from heat stroke all the time.

563
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,380
You really want to avoid that.

564
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,640
One way to avoid that is to
cool the appropriate surfaces

565
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,050
of your body and the appropriate
surfaces in this case

566
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,910
are the upper cheeks

567
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,560
or I would say the upper half of the face,

568
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,520
the palms of your hands and
the bottoms of your feet.

569
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,600
I've talked about this
on the podcast before

570
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,930
and in the guest episode
with Dr. Craig Heller,

571
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,900
my colleague in the biology
department at Stanford,

572
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,510
but just very briefly, these surfaces,

573
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,370
the upper half of the face,

574
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,120
the palms of the hands and
the bottoms of the feet

575
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,720
are what we call

576
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,720
glabrous skin surfaces,
G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous.

577
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,710
And those surfaces are unique
in that just below them,

578
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,120
the vasculature is different
than elsewhere in the body.

579
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,480
Normally the passage of blood goes from

580
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
arteries to capillaries to veins,

581
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,150
but just beneath the
glabrous skin on the bottoms

582
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,280
of the feet, the hands in
the upper half of the face,

583
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,970
you have what are called
arterio-venous anastomoses.

584
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,020
These are portals of
blood that go directly

585
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,530
from arteries to veins and in doing so,

586
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,530
allow the body to dump heat
more readily, more quickly.

587
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,250
So as it turns out that if
you are to cool the palms

588
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,370
of the hands, the bottoms of the feet

589
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,470
and the upper half of the face,

590
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,690
you can more efficiently
reduce core body temperature

591
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,190
for sake of offsetting hyperthermia

592
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,420
and for improving athletic performance

593
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,300
and maybe even cognitive performance.

594
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,180
So we will return to
the specific protocols

595
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,280
for doing that later in the episode,

596
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,140
I'll give you a lot of
details about how to do that,

597
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,680
how to do that without the use of

598
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,270
any fancy or expensive technology.

599
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,410
There are some technologies

600
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,930
that are now commercially
available, for instance,

601
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,040
the so-called CoolMitt

602
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,190
that will allow you to do
that with maximum efficiency,

603
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,480
but I'll also give you some
at home methods to do this

604
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,523
either in the gym or on runs
or for sake of cognitive work.

605
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,270
So the two key themes again

606
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,580
are understand that
baseline circadian rhythm

607
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,050
in temperature, and understand
that the best way to cool

608
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,840
the body is going to be

609
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,430
by making sure that
something cold contacts

610
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,390
the bottoms of your feet,

611
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,530
the palms of your hands and
the upper half of the face.

612
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,470
Ideally all three

613
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,920
if your goal is to lower core
body temperature quickly,

614
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,150
and again, just cooling
off the back of your neck

615
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,390
or the top of your head
or your torso with a towel

616
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,400
is going to be the least efficient way

617
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,700
to lower core body temperature
and might even increase

618
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,500
body temperature under certain conditions.

619
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,870
With those two points in mind,

620
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,300
we can start to think
about directed deliberate

621
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,710
cold exposure protocols,

622
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,780
and there are a number
of different reasons

623
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,830
to use deliberate cold exposure.

624
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,780
And I want to separate those out for you.

625
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,850
There are cold protocols
that have been tested

626
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,030
in peer reviewed studies that are designed

627
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,170
to improve mental performance.

628
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,860
They are designed to improve
things like resilience

629
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,693
or your grittiness,

630
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,550
or your ability to move through challenge

631
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,310
or to regulate your mind
and your internal state

632
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,830
under conditions of stress

633
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,320
and we can define stress
very specifically as times

634
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,680
when adrenaline also called epinephrine

635
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,290
and or norepinephrine
also called noradrenaline,

636
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,600
are elevated in your body.

637
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,440
Forgive me for the noradrenaline,

638
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,280
norepinephrine, adrenaline,
epinephrine nomenclature,

639
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,500
I didn't make that up.

640
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,900
It turns out that every once in a while,

641
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,100
scientists disagree, imagine that,

642
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,790
and you'll get multiple scientists

643
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,810
naming the same molecule different things.

644
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,650
So epinephrine and adrenaline
are the same thing.

645
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,390
I will use them interchangeably.

646
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,230
Norepinephrine and noradrenaline
are the same thing.

647
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,400
I will use those terms interchangeably.

648
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,100
Noradrenaline and adrenaline

649
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,120
are often co-released
in the brain and body.

650
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,270
So they work as kind of a pair to increase

651
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,820
our level of agitation,

652
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,450
our level of focus and our
desire and our ability to move.

653
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,470
They are often co-released
from different sites

654
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,890
in the brain and body with dopamine,

655
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,710
a molecule that is commonly misunderstood

656
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,040
as the molecule of pleasure,

657
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,350
but is actually the
molecule of motivation,

658
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,750
reward and pursuit.

659
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,970
So dopamine, norepinephrine
and noradrenaline

660
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,220
tend to be released together
under certain conditions

661
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,190
and today you'll learn how
deliberate cold exposure

662
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,310
can be used to cause increases
in the release of several,

663
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,930
if not, all of these in ways

664
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:21,000
that can improve your levels
of attention and your mood.

665
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But the key point is that
your mental state is shifted

666
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,840
when you are exposed to
certain forms of cold,

667
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,100
and many people use
deliberate cold exposure

668
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,730
specifically to shift
their body state as a way

669
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,930
to train their mental state
so that they can better cope

670
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,290
with stress in real life and by real life,

671
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,940
I mean when life presents
stressful events,

672
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,800
and I will give you specific protocols

673
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,630
as to how you can do that, in other words,

674
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,680
how you can become more resilient

675
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,200
through the use of
deliberate cold exposure.

676
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,420
Now, because of the ways in
which deliberate cold exposure

677
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,840
can increase this category of chemicals

678
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,920
called the catecholamines,

679
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,670
that includes dopamine,
norepinephrine and epinephrine,

680
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,870
it can also be used to elevate mood

681
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,740
for long periods of time.

682
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,120
And I'm going to discuss
a specific protocol

683
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,070
that has been shown to
increase these chemicals

684
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,070
anywhere from 2.5X to
250%, to as high as 500%,

685
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,740
five times over baseline.

686
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,330
Now you might be asking whether
or not it is a good thing

687
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,180
to raise chemicals like
norepinephrine and dopamine

688
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,170
to such a great degree,

689
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,480
whether or not that's healthy for us,

690
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,100
whether or not they can harm us.

691
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,750
But it turns out that these
elevations in norepinephrine

692
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,820
and dopamine are very long lasting in ways

693
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,090
that people report
feeling vast improvements

694
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,190
in mood and vast improvements

695
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,760
in levels of cognitive
attention and energy.

696
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,920
So by my read of the literature,

697
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,230
these seem to be healthy
increases in our baseline levels

698
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,760
of these chemicals in ways
that can really support us

699
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,810
so I'll give you a protocol for that.

700
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,760
Now, those are some of the mental effects

701
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,230
of deliberate cold exposure,

702
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,500
but deliberate cold exposure
has also been studied

703
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,040
in animal models and in humans

704
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,860
in the context of increasing metabolism,

705
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,980
even in converting certain fat cells

706
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,320
that we call white fat cells,

707
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,120
which are the ones where energy is stored,

708
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,470
they're the ones that
we typically think of

709
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,560
as kind of blubbery fat,
to beige or brown fat,

710
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,330
which is thermogenic fat,

711
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,420
meaning that it can increase
core body temperature

712
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,680
and serves kind of the furnace

713
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,040
by which we increase our core metabolism.

714
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,180
So with a very broad stroke,

715
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,660
I can say that white fat is
generally the kind of fat

716
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,610
that people want less of
and beige fat and brown fat

717
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,850
is generally the kind of fat that

718
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,810
if you're going to have fat cells and

719
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,330
you certainly need fat
cells that you want more of.

720
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,600
They are thermogenic,
they help you stay lean.

721
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,130
They actually serve as a
reservoir for heating your body up

722
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,190
if you're ever confronted
with a cold challenge.

723
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,960
So we're going to talk
about how to use cold

724
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,580
for metabolism as well.

725
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,413
And of course,

726
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:57,960
people are using deliberate cold exposure

727
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,010
to reduce inflammation post exercise,

728
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,710
to reduce inflammation generally.

729
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,550
And people are also using
cold to enhance performance

730
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,560
in the context of strength training,

731
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,160
in the context of endurance training

732
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,480
and we'll talk about those data as well,

733
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,970
but where I'd like to start
is with mental performance

734
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,320
and I'd like to detail what happens

735
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,460
when we deliberately
expose ourselves to cold.

736
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,650
It's key to point out the word deliberate.

737
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,640
If I don't say otherwise,
then throughout this episode,

738
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,750
if I say cold exposure, I
mean deliberate cold exposure.

739
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,100
And the reason I point that
out is that as my colleague,

740
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,740
David Spiegel, and the
department of psychiatry

741
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,170
at Stanford says,

742
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,590
it's not just about the
state that we are in,

743
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,530
it's about the state that
we are in and whether or not

744
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,920
we had anything to with placing
ourselves into that state

745
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
and whether or not we did
that on purpose or not.

746
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,060
And what he really means
by that statement is that

747
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,110
there are important effects
of what we call mindset.

748
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,380
Mindset was a topic discussed
in the guest episode

749
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,670
with Ali Crumb some weeks ago.

750
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,270
If you haven't seen that
episode, I highly recommend it.

751
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,940
And the science of my mindset
tells us that if we are doing

752
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,910
something deliberately and we believe

753
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,640
that it's going to be good for us,

754
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
it actually can lead to a different set

755
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,230
of physiological effects than if something

756
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,850
is happening to us against our
will or without our control.

757
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,650
Now, this is different
than placebo effects.

758
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,900
Placebo effects are distinct
from mindset effects.

759
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,350
If you want to learn more
about that distinction,

760
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,300
please see the episode with Ali Crumb.

761
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,360
But again, when I talk about
cold exposure in this episode,

762
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm talking about
deliberate cold exposure,

763
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,120
meaning that you are
placing yourself into a

764
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,870
cold environment on
purpose in order to extract

765
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,933
a particular set of benefits.

766
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,820
When we talk about deliberate
cold exposure, almost always,

767
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,100
that means getting uncomfortable.

768
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,080
And one of the most common questions I get

769
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,700
when discussing the use
of cold for sake of mental

770
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,720
or physical performance,
metabolism, et cetera,

771
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,340
is how cold should it be?

772
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,480
How cold should the water be?

773
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,940
How cold should the environment be?

774
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,300
And I just will tell you now

775
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,760
and I'm going to say this again and again

776
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,593
throughout the episode,

777
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:06,860
cause it will continue to be
true throughout the episode

778
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,610
and long after the episode is over,

779
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,870
how cold depends on your cold tolerance,

780
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,320
your core metabolism,

781
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,070
and a number of other features
that there is simply no way

782
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,480
I could know or have access to.

783
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,943
So I would like you to
use this rule of thumb.

784
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,380
If you are using deliberate cold exposure,

785
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,820
the environment that
you place yourself into

786
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,290
should place your mind
into a state of whoa,

787
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,840
I would really like to get
out of this environment,

788
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,440
but I can stay in safely.

789
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,260
Now that might seem a
little bit arbitrary,

790
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,610
but let's say you were
to get into a warm shower

791
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,160
and it would feel really, really nice

792
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,120
and you were to start
turning down the warm

793
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,400
and turning up the cold.

794
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,350
There would be some threshold at which

795
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,600
it would feel uncomfortable to you.

796
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,800
And if you were to continue
to make a little bit colder

797
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,610
than that, you would really
want to get out of the shower,

798
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,170
but you are confident
that you could stay in

799
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,080
without risking your health,
without risking a heart attack.

800
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,870
Now that's very different
than jumping into

801
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,200
a very, very cold lake or

802
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,780
I've seen these images of
people that will cut holes into

803
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,040
frozen over lakes and they'll
get into that cold water.

804
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,240
If you are trained to do that

805
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,170
and you have the right
conditions, et cetera,

806
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,270
that can be done reasonably safely,

807
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,770
but that's certainly not
what I would start with.

808
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,740
And for many people,
that would be too cold

809
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,670
and indeed some people
can go into cold shock

810
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,170
and can die as a consequence of getting

811
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,250
to that extremely cold water very quickly.

812
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,450
Now that's not to scare you away

813
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,880
from deliberate cold exposure.

814
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,300
It's just to say that there's
no simple prescriptive

815
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,840
of how cold to make environment

816
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,250
in order to extract maximum benefit

817
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,260
for mental or physical performance.

818
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,270
So the simple rule of thumb is going to be

819
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,150
place yourself into an environment

820
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,590
that is uncomfortably cold,

821
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,330
but that you can stay in safely.

822
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,980
And you'll have to experiment
a bit and that number,

823
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,220
meaning that temperature,
will vary from day to day.

824
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,460
It will vary across the 24 hour cycle

825
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,290
because of that endogenous,

826
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,920
meaning that internal rhythm,

827
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,250
in temperature that I
talked about earlier.

828
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,190
Low early in the day,

829
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,489
rises into the afternoon, drops at night.

830
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,899
You can actually do this
experiment if you like.

831
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,730
Try getting into a cold
shower at 11 o'clock at night

832
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,520
if you want versus try doing it

833
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,020
in the middle of the afternoon.

834
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,137
It's quite a different experience

835
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:25,620
and by quite a different experience,

836
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,630
I mean it requires quite a
different degree of resilience

837
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,110
and leaning into the practice.

838
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,810
Your willpower will have
to be higher I suspect

839
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,840
late in the day as it
compared to early in the day,

840
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,730
but that will vary of course
between individuals as well.

841
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,989
So the most common question I get

842
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,309
about deliberate cold exposure

843
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,110
is how cold should the water be?

844
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,250
And we've answered that with
uncomfortably cold to the point

845
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,083
where you want to get out,

846
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,810
but you can safely stay in.

847
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,520
The second most common question I get

848
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,880
about deliberate cold
exposure is whether or not

849
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,500
cold showers are as good,

850
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
better or worse than cold water immersion

851
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,300
up to the neck, for instance.

852
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,360
I also get a lot of questions
about whether or not

853
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,950
cryo chambers are better
than all the others,

854
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,300
et cetera, et cetera.

855
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,020
I'm going to make all of that

856
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,970
very simple for you by
saying cold water immersion

857
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,270
up to the neck with your
feet and hands submerged also

858
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,093
is going to be the most effective.

859
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,740
Second best would be cold shower.

860
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,050
Third best would be to go outside

861
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,480
with a minimum amount of
clothing, but of course,

862
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,100
clothing that is culturally appropriate

863
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,580
and that would allow you to
experience cold to the point

864
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,470
where you would almost want
to shiver or start shivering.

865
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,060
Now there are a number of different,

866
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,410
important constraints
that are going to dictate

867
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,580
whether or not you use
one form of cold exposure

868
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,420
or the other.

869
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,010
For instance, some
people don't have access

870
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,040
to cold water immersion.

871
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,040
They don't have access to ice
baths or cold water tanks,

872
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,220
cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera.

873
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,800
In that case, showers would
be the next best solution.

874
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,210
I do want to emphasize that
there have been very few,

875
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,410
if any, studies of cold showers,

876
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,250
and you can imagine why
this would be the case.

877
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,083
In a laboratory,

878
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,010
you want to control for as
many variables as possible.

879
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:16,010
So placing people into a cold
water immersion or an ice bath

880
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,370
up to the neck and insisting
they keep their hands

881
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:21,270
and feet under is very easy to control.

882
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,620
It means that everyone can
do essentially the same thing

883
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,160
whereas with cold showers,

884
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,320
people are different sized bodies.

885
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,620
Some people are going
to put their head under.

886
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,290
Some people are going to lean forward.

887
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,020
Measuring the amount of cold
water exposure on the body

888
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,230
is very hard to do

889
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,270
and so there aren't a lot
of studies of cold showers,

890
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,430
but of course,

891
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,720
a lot of people don't have
access to cold water immersion

892
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,420
so they have to use cold showers.

893
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,430
And if you don't have
access to both, of course,

894
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,550
then going outside on a cold
day can be of a benefit.

895
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,440
But I will point out
that the heat transfer

896
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,020
from your body into water is much higher,

897
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,760
four times greater, if not even greater,

898
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,440
depending on the temperature of the water,

899
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,410
in water as opposed to in air.

900
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,930
So it's going to be much more efficient

901
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,810
to do cold water immersion
than anything else,

902
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,650
cold showers after that
and put yourself into

903
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,440
a cold environment would
be the third best thing.

904
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,030
I'm not going to get into cryo chambers

905
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,270
because they carry quite
a high degree of cost.

906
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,660
And again, there aren't
many studies of them.

907
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,100
So if you have access to cryo chambers,

908
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,780
I'm sure that the cryo chamber facility

909
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,380
has told you about all
these incredible benefits

910
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,080
and I don't doubt that some
of those benefits truly exist,

911
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,380
but most people just
don't have the resources

912
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,420
or the access to those

913
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,670
so we're going to leave cryo chambers

914
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,980
out of today's discussion.

915
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,120
And of course I realize
there's a fourth category

916
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,440
of cold exposure out there.

917
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,900
People are wearing ice vests.

918
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,920
Believe it or not, those
exist, ice underwear.

919
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,453
Yes, those exist.

920
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,790
You can look for them
on Amazon if you like.

921
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,380
They are putting cold
packs in their armpits

922
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,680
or in their groin or elsewhere in order to

923
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,520
stimulate some of the effects of cold

924
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,820
on mental and physical performance.

925
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,970
I'm not going to address those
in too much detail today.

926
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,460
They can be efficient in certain ways,

927
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,940
but as you'll learn about
later in the episode,

928
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,500
cooling the palms, the upper face

929
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,650
and the bottoms of the feet

930
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,450
is going to be far more efficient

931
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,450
and unfortunately I think most
of the people that are using

932
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,410
ice packs to increase
their core metabolism

933
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,470
are not aware of the glabrous skin cooling

934
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,860
and how it can be a very,
very potent stimulus

935
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,130
so we'll return to that later.

936
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,400
Unless I say otherwise,

937
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,877
I'm mainly going to be focusing
on cold water immersion

938
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,050
and cold showers.

939
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,840
So let's talk about protocols
for enhancing mental health

940
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,583
and performance using
deliberate cold exposure.

941
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,820
What happens when we get into
cold is that we experience

942
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,480
an increase in norepinephrine,

943
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,550
in noradrenaline release
and in adrenaline release.

944
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,220
The fact that cold
exposure, deliberate or no,

945
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,190
increases norepinephrine and epinephrine

946
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,530
in our brain and body means that it is

947
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,670
a very reliable stimulus for increasing

948
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,590
norepinephrine and epinephrine.

949
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,440
That's sort of an obvious statement,

950
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,070
but that obvious
statement can be leveraged

951
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,580
to systematically build up
what we call resilience.

952
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,710
Now, when we experience
a stressor in life,

953
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,850
whether or not it's something bad happens

954
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,270
in our relationship or something
bad happens in the world

955
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,390
and we feel stress,

956
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,500
that stress is the
consequence of increases

957
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,010
in norepinephrine and epinephrine
in our brain and body.

958
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,700
Very similar, if not identical,

959
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,760
to the kinds of increases

960
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,230
that come from deliberate cold exposure.

961
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,990
So deliberate cold
exposure is an opportunity

962
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,510
to deliberately stress our body and yet,

963
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,560
because it's deliberate

964
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,050
and because we can take certain steps,

965
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,390
which I'll describe in a moment,

966
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,880
we can learn to maintain mental clarity,

967
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,730
we can learn to maintain
calm while our body

968
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,540
is in a state of stress.

969
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,840
And that can be immensely useful

970
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,320
when encountering stressors
in other parts of life.

971
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,580
And that's what we call
resilience or grit,

972
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,520
our ability or mental toughness,

973
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,610
our ability to lean into
challenge or to tolerate challenge

974
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,200
while keeping our heads
straight, so to speak.

975
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,730
So one simple protocol
for increasing resilience

976
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,450
is to pick a temperature
that's uncomfortable

977
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,570
of shower or cold immersion,

978
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,870
and then to get in for a
certain duration of time

979
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,240
and then to get out.

980
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,270
Now, it's important to understand

981
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,190
that people will
experience different levels

982
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,360
of norepinephrine and adrenaline release

983
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,200
when getting into cold water.

984
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,010
Some people, because they
dread the cold so much,

985
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,777
will actually experience norepinephrine

986
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:31,080
and epinephrine increases

987
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,610
even before they get into the cold water

988
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,150
or under the cold shower.

989
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,270
Now you may have experienced this.

990
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,930
I've certainly experienced this.

991
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,450
I'm dreading it, I don't want to do it

992
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,860
and I have to force myself to do it.

993
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,610
And indeed epinephrine and
norepinephrine and its surges

994
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,920
can be thought of as sort of
walls that we have to confront

995
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,960
and go over.

996
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,060
And I'd like you to
conceptualize them that way,

997
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,610
because it allows us to build protocols

998
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,120
that can be very
objective and can allow us

999
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,280
to monitor our progress in
terms of building resilience.

1000
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,170
So one option is to simply say, okay,

1001
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,320
I'm going to force myself

1002
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,750
to get into the cold
shower for one minute.

1003
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,390
How cold, again, uncomfortably cold,

1004
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,460
but you can stay in safely

1005
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,720
or I'm going to get into
the ice bath for one minute.

1006
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,860
Ice baths are very cold inevitably.

1007
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,480
And what is also inevitable is that

1008
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,910
when you get into the cold,

1009
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,400
you will experience a surge

1010
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,130
in epinephrine and norepinephrine.

1011
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,710
That's non-negotiable
because it's mediated

1012
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,290
by cold receptors on
the surface of your body

1013
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,100
and your skin and the way
that they trigger the release

1014
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,610
of norepinephrine and epinephrine,

1015
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,300
not just from the adrenals,

1016
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,270
from the adrenal glands
above your kidneys,

1017
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,820
but also from regions of your brain,

1018
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,990
like the locus coeruleus,

1019
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,940
which cause increases in
the tension and alertness,

1020
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,727
and from other locations in
your body where epinephrine

1021
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:47,150
and norepinephrine are released.

1022
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,800
In other words, cold is
a non-negotiable stimulus

1023
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,140
for increasing epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

1024
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,010
Even if you are the
toughest person in the world

1025
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,503
and you love the cold,

1026
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,560
that increase in epinephrine
and norepinephrine

1027
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,070
is going to happen.

1028
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,750
So the way to think about
norepinephrine and epinephrine

1029
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,250
in this context of
building mental resilience

1030
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,480
is that you have two options.

1031
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,370
You can either try to
extend the duration of time

1032
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,480
that you are in the
deliberate cold exposure.

1033
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,010
So going from one minute to
75 seconds to two minutes

1034
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,440
and so on over a period of days

1035
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,837
or one way to approach this

1036
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,870
and the way that I particularly favor

1037
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,747
is to take the context of the day

1038
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:32,610
and the moment into account,

1039
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,300
meaning we have different
levels of grit and resilience

1040
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,730
on different days and
depending on the landscape

1041
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,780
of our life at the time,

1042
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,120
even the time of day that
we're doing these protocols

1043
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,303
and start to be able to sense
the release of epinephrine,

1044
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,410
and norepinephrine in our
brain and body and see those

1045
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,520
as walls that we want to climb over

1046
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,320
in order to build resilience
and to start counting

1047
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,950
the number of walls that we traverse

1048
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,790
and the distance between those walls

1049
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,730
as we do deliberate cold exposure.

1050
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,290
Let me give you an example
of the timed protocol

1051
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:06,890
because that one is very straightforward,

1052
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,600
although I do not think it is as powerful

1053
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,050
for building mental resilience.

1054
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,920
The time protocol would be Monday,

1055
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,350
I do one minute of
deliberate cold exposure

1056
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,190
at a given temperature.

1057
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,340
Wednesday, I extend
that by 50% and Friday,

1058
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,380
I do deliberate cold
exposure for twice as long

1059
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,850
as I did it on Monday.

1060
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,240
And if I were to continue that every week,

1061
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,100
Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

1062
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,530
I would continue to either
increase the duration

1063
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,160
or I would lower the temperature
and reduce the duration,

1064
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,520
this kind of thing, very much
like sets and reps in the gym.

1065
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,710
Now that option is very objective.

1066
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,300
You could even log it in a book

1067
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,973
and as you develop the ability
to stay in cold temperatures,

1068
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,200
even progressively colder
and colder temperatures

1069
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,230
for longer and longer periods of time,

1070
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,470
you will become more resilient.

1071
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,660
What do I mean by that?

1072
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,640
Well, my operational
definition of resilience

1073
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,160
is that you are able to resist
escape from the stressor,

1074
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,910
the cold, by virtue of your willpower,

1075
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,800
which is really your prefrontal cortex

1076
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,830
causing top down control on your reflexes

1077
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,830
and your limbic system
and your hypothalamus,

1078
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,870
which are basically telling you

1079
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,960
to get out of that cold water,

1080
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,540
get out of that cold
environment and in doing so,

1081
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,070
you are basically getting better

1082
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,890
at controlling your behavior
when your brain and body

1083
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,040
are flooded with
norepinephrine and epinephrine.

1084
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,630
That's a very reductionist
way to explain resilience

1085
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,140
or grit or mental toughness,

1086
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,530
but it's a reductionist
way of explaining it

1087
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,550
that is very closely
tied to the biology end

1088
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,670
of the psychology.

1089
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,710
And it is a fact that
norepinephrine and epinephrine

1090
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,200
release in the brain and body

1091
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,550
are the generic universal
code for stressor.

1092
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,520
There is no unique chemical signature

1093
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,430
for different forms of
stressors, that is the only one,

1094
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,263
although of course there are

1095
00:44:49,263 --> 00:44:50,860
other chemicals involved as well.

1096
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,780
So you could go for time and you could try

1097
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,470
and reduce the temperature
and increase the time

1098
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,480
over a period of days or weeks.

1099
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,050
Now that's an attractive
way to approach things,

1100
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,790
but the problem is that you
don't have an infinite amount

1101
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:06,040
of room with which to lower temperature,

1102
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,140
because eventually you
will get into temperatures

1103
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,900
that are either so cold
that they are dangerous

1104
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,390
or you have to stay in cold temperatures

1105
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,980
for such long periods that
it becomes impractical

1106
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,970
because presumably you also have to

1107
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,490
take care of other aspects of your life,

1108
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,060
you can't just sit all
day in the ice bath.

1109
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,270
Now for that reason,

1110
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,640
I favor a protocol in which
you build mental resilience

1111
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,490
and mental toughness through

1112
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,090
two different types of protocols.

1113
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,420
The first one involves counting walls.

1114
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,430
Now, what do I mean by walls?

1115
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,210
I mean the sensation of, no,

1116
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:41,320
I don't want to do this and
the idea or the sensation

1117
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,710
in your brain and body that
you actually want to leave

1118
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,560
that environment and go warm up.

1119
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,720
Now again, for some people,

1120
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,160
that will be even before
getting into the ice bath

1121
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,110
or cold shower.

1122
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,740
So if you are feeling very resistant

1123
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,040
to getting into the ice bath

1124
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,340
or cold shower and you manage to do that,

1125
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,203
that's going over what
I would call one wall.

1126
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,690
Then for some period of time,

1127
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,600
you might actually feel
comfortable in the ice bath,

1128
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,800
cold water or cold shower.

1129
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,560
And you feel like you could stay there

1130
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,450
for some period of time,

1131
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,300
that you could stay there
for a minute or two minutes,

1132
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,890
but inevitably, the next wall will arrive.

1133
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,870
And I would encourage
you to pay attention to

1134
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:19,330
when that next wall arrives

1135
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,000
and actually having an awareness,

1136
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,380
that so-called interceptive
awareness as we call it,

1137
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,690
of when that next surge
adrenaline epinephrine comes

1138
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,370
or whether or not it
reaches a certain threshold

1139
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,440
in your brain and body that
you feel you want to get out

1140
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,270
and you're able to stay in for
even just 10 seconds longer,

1141
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,290
that means you've
traversed yet another wall.

1142
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,190
And if you continue to stay
in that cold environment,

1143
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,907
you'll find that the next wall will come

1144
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:45,070
and the next wall will come.

1145
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,300
Now eventually of course,
you will get very, very numb

1146
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,400
depending on how cold it is

1147
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,220
and you could also place
yourself into danger.

1148
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,050
So you have to maintain cognitive control,

1149
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,300
counting these walls,
traversing these walls,

1150
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,160
but getting out at some point, of course.

1151
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,890
So my favorite protocol for
building mental toughness

1152
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,240
AKA grit, AKA resilience,

1153
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,370
is to take into account that some days,

1154
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,150
just getting into the ice bath

1155
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,680
or cold shower represents a
wall, some days it doesn't.

1156
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,740
Some days you get in and you
feel you could go 10 minutes,

1157
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,090
other days you get in and you feel like

1158
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:20,460
you could only go a minute and
setting a designated number

1159
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,010
of walls before you start the protocol

1160
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,680
is going to be very beneficial here.

1161
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,090
So you say, as long as I can do it safely,

1162
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,400
I'm going to do three walls today.

1163
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,530
The first wall is getting in.

1164
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,800
The second wall will
arrive when it arrives

1165
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,410
and the third wall will
arrive when it arrives

1166
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,130
and I'll get over that
wall and then I'll get out.

1167
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,730
The next day, you might do five walls.

1168
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,960
The next day, you might
do three walls again,

1169
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,530
but you might lower the temperature.

1170
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,920
This gives you tremendous flexibility

1171
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,840
and indeed it gives you much more latitude

1172
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,520
to be able to use the same
temperatures in different ways,

1173
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,740
or to reduce the temperature
only a little bit

1174
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,800
and still get a lot of stimulus,

1175
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,170
meaning a lot of results
out of a given protocol.

1176
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,900
Whereas people who are just
going for temperature and time

1177
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,950
eventually become cold adapted.

1178
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,800
They get very, very good
at doing three minutes

1179
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,760
or six minutes or even 10
minutes at a given temperature

1180
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,140
and so then they feel like they have

1181
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,530
to lower the temperature
even more and even more

1182
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,290
and eventually they just bought them out.

1183
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,320
There's nowhere else to go.

1184
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,140
There's no way to get
improvements out of the protocol.

1185
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,280
At least not in terms
of mental resilience.

1186
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,610
Of course, there's still
the positive effects

1187
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,630
on inflammation and metabolism, et cetera,

1188
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,840
that we'll talk about in a little bit.

1189
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,540
But the key thing here
is to design protocols

1190
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,630
that are going to work for you over time

1191
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,410
and for you very, very hardy,

1192
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,550
very, very tough guys and gals out there

1193
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,680
that can get right into

1194
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,120
an ice bath or a very, very cold immersion

1195
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,530
and you can just grind it
out for six or 10 minutes,

1196
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,730
or you can even do that
by remaining peaceful,

1197
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,100
well more points to you, but guess what?

1198
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,270
That's the equivalent of
already having loaded up

1199
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,360
the barbell with 600 pounds
and done your 10 reps.

1200
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,000
There's not a whole
lot more variable space

1201
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,330
with which to get benefits
from that stimulus.

1202
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,440
And in the weight room,

1203
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,330
people understand that you
can adjust, for instance,

1204
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,510
the speed of the movement,

1205
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,010
or you can start combining that movement

1206
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,660
with pre-exhaustion, et cetera.

1207
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,100
With cold exposure,

1208
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,620
you don't have as much
variable space to play with.

1209
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,710
So if your goal is to build resilience,

1210
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:18,560
either go for time as a
function of temperature,

1211
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,250
or what I suggest is to
start recognizing these walls

1212
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,900
as an experience of resistance in you

1213
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,850
and going over those walls,
set a certain number of walls

1214
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,840
that you're going to go over
on a given day and do that

1215
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,680
at a given temperature,
and then to mix it up.

1216
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,450
And ideally you might even
throw in one more wall

1217
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,283
at the end,

1218
00:49:39,283 --> 00:49:41,110
if you're really feeling bold and brave

1219
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,460
because that's going to
build out further resilience.

1220
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,500
But if you want cold
exposure to work for you

1221
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,930
for sake of building up resilience

1222
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,510
and mental toughness over time,

1223
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,380
you're going to want to
vary this parameter space

1224
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,750
in some sort of way.

1225
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,100
And you don't have to be
super systematic about it.

1226
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,350
That's the beauty of this kind of approach

1227
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,930
because you're relying on the fact

1228
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,900
that those walls really represent times

1229
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,410
in which you are forcing
your top down control,

1230
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,150
your prefrontal cortex to
clamp down on your reflex

1231
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,050
and you're learning behavioral
control in the context

1232
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,980
of your body having elevated levels

1233
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,550
of these catecholamines,
norepinephrine and epinephrine.

1234
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,500
And that translates to real life

1235
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,560
in a much more realistic way I
believe because in real life,

1236
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,330
you're not really engaging in stressors

1237
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,270
for a given amount of time

1238
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,040
that you know how long it's going to last

1239
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,460
and you know the context, no.

1240
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,830
Most stressors arrive
in the form of surprises

1241
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,850
we don't like, text messages
that deliver bad news,

1242
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,530
information about the
outside world or real world

1243
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,010
and online interactions
that send our system

1244
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,850
into a state of increased
norepinephrine and epinephrine.

1245
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,660
And if you start to
think of those as walls

1246
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,100
that you can tolerate and climb over

1247
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,500
while staying and calm and clear of mind,

1248
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,180
then you can really
imagine how the ice bath

1249
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,000
and other forms of cold
exposure are really serving

1250
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,070
to train you up for real life stressors.

1251
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,250
The next question that I always get is

1252
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,220
what should my mental state be

1253
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,940
while I'm exposing myself
to this uncomfortable,

1254
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,680
yet safe condition of cold?

1255
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,590
Well, you have two options

1256
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,490
and there are probably
other options as well.

1257
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,010
One is to try and calm yourself

1258
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,680
to remain as mentally still as possible.

1259
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,150
The other is to lean into that challenge

1260
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,420
and so to grind it out and here,

1261
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,750
I have to say that this is
a lot like teaching someone

1262
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,410
to drive on a gravel road.

1263
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,900
For any of you that have
driven on a gravel road,

1264
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,870
you know that there is no optimal speed

1265
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:33,990
for all gravel roads.

1266
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,937
It depends on the density
of the gravel, et cetera,

1267
00:51:35,937 --> 00:51:37,760
and the vehicle, et cetera.

1268
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,140
So for instance, on some gravel roads,

1269
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,990
when you start to drive and
the dust starts to kick up,

1270
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,700
your best option is to drive fast

1271
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,740
and put that dust cloud behind you.

1272
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,120
On other gravel roads,
if you try and do that,

1273
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,800
the dust actually kicks
up around the vehicle

1274
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,020
and it makes it hard to see

1275
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,960
and sometimes you have to slow down.

1276
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,810
The same thing is true for getting through

1277
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,520
deliberate cold exposure.

1278
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,530
Sometimes it's easier to calm yourself.

1279
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,730
One way to do that is
through double inhales

1280
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,000
through the nose and extended
exhales through the mouth,

1281
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,770
or simply by trying to
control your breathing

1282
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:09,740
and reduce the pace of
your breath and increase

1283
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,233
the volume of your breathing.

1284
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:15,420
I have to say that everyone
experiences a shortening

1285
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,340
of breath when they get into
uncomfortably cold water,

1286
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,620
that is a universal
physiological response.

1287
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,210
Everyone also experiences
a 30 to 80% decrease

1288
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,430
in cognitive function, in
particular, the frontal cortex.

1289
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,440
The metabolism of your
frontal cortex goes down,

1290
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,440
the metabolism meaning the
activity of brain areas

1291
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,970
associated with stress
and panic goes way up.

1292
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:41,400
And so anchoring your mind
in cognitive activities

1293
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,220
as you get into the cold can be very,

1294
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,860
very helpful for
maintaining clarity of mind.

1295
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,820
In fact, one thing that
I sometimes recommend

1296
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,690
is that people try and engage

1297
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,720
in some sort of cognitive
exercise while in the cold,

1298
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,610
not as a form of distraction,

1299
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,640
but as a way to maintain
clarity of thinking

1300
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,890
and to learn how to do that
when the body is flooded

1301
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,290
with all these chemicals
that make us stressed.

1302
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,123
So for instance,

1303
00:53:03,123 --> 00:53:06,050
you could do math problems and
not two plus two equals four,

1304
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,250
not three times three equals nine,

1305
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,740
but things that require
a little bit more focus

1306
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,380
and attention working memory and so forth.

1307
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,470
You could also start to have thoughts

1308
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:20,600
that you deliberately impose
a full sentence structure on.

1309
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,140
That's actually quite tough.

1310
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,320
You could try and recall
specific bouts of information

1311
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,153
that are challenging.

1312
00:53:26,153 --> 00:53:29,280
This is teaching your
mind how to stay online,

1313
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,113
or rather I should say,

1314
00:53:30,113 --> 00:53:32,490
this is you teaching
your prefrontal cortex,

1315
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,880
how to stay engaged while you
have high levels of stress

1316
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
in your body.

1317
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,290
Years ago, I had a friend who works

1318
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,490
in the neuroscience world,
research neuroscientist,

1319
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,720
who was obsessed with
this very bizarre sport

1320
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,700
that I don't necessarily recommend at all,

1321
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,630
which is the combination
of boxing and chess.

1322
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:51,840
You may have seen this on YouTube

1323
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,280
where people will box around,

1324
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,540
legitimate boxing around,
they're sparring all out often.

1325
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,220
And then at the end of the round,

1326
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,310
instead of resting in the corner,

1327
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,030
they actually sit down and play chess,

1328
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,100
and then they go back to
boxing and back to chess.

1329
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,590
Again, not a sport that I recommend,

1330
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,110
but the reason he was
obsessed with this is because

1331
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:11,410
he studies the impact of stress
on cognitive performance.

1332
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:14,370
And what that particular
very bizarre sport was doing

1333
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,630
was toggling back and forth

1334
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,610
between different states of mind.

1335
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,090
Now it's used both to
increase cognitive clarity

1336
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,630
for the fighter when they box,

1337
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,460
because staying calm and clear thinking

1338
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,750
is very important to
winning boxing matches.

1339
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,810
Believe it or not, it's
not an all outrage.

1340
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,220
It's a very calculated
game of mental chess

1341
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,570
and physical chess
that's quite high stakes

1342
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:35,520
as you can imagine.

1343
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,730
It's also used in some circles
as a way to teach people

1344
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,670
how to engage in cognitive performance

1345
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,390
when their body is simply
filled to a stress.

1346
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:46,870
So in the boxing chess example,

1347
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,400
the replacement for the cold
water is actually the boxing,

1348
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,310
it's the thing that's
supposed to induce the stress

1349
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,590
cause getting hit is
stressful and the risk

1350
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,000
of getting hit is
stressful for most people.

1351
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,740
So again, if you think about
deliberate cold exposure

1352
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,400
as a way of just
systematically and reliably

1353
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,450
inducing epinephrine and
norepinephrine release

1354
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,040
and delivering stress,

1355
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,750
well then this idea of
maintaining cognitive clarity

1356
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,640
and actually engaging in cognitive tasks

1357
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,290
while in the ice bath or cold shower

1358
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,650
can actually be very beneficial.

1359
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,980
Even though it might
sound a little bit silly,

1360
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,670
you are really training up your ability

1361
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:20,430
to keep your brain working

1362
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:24,200
when the reflex is to shut
down the parts of your brain

1363
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,340
that are involved in deliberate
planning and thinking.

1364
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,330
Now another important aspect
of deliberate cold exposure

1365
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,290
that I rarely if ever hear discussed,

1366
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,510
but is vitally important is whether or not

1367
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,710
you move around or not.

1368
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,900
And here's the reason.

1369
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,300
When you get into cold
water and you remain there

1370
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,280
for some period of time,

1371
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,710
your body is generating
heat and that heat generates

1372
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,380
what's called a thermal layer

1373
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,283
that surrounds your entire body.

1374
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,410
So if you stay still,

1375
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:57,270
you are actually warmer
than if you move around,

1376
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,470
you can try this the next time

1377
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,960
you're doing your
deliberate cold exposure.

1378
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,220
If you're submerged up to the neck,

1379
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,680
sit there for about 10, 30 seconds

1380
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,510
and be very, very still of body.

1381
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,820
In fact, this is the way
that most people start

1382
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,130
to do deliberate cold exposure.

1383
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,460
They give this very stoic look.

1384
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,000
They don't blink, they look very peaceful.

1385
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,810
Some of them even look tough

1386
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:17,800
or they make a very even A, emotional face

1387
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,190
and so it looks like they're really tough,

1388
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:22,410
but they are so still
that believe it or not,

1389
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,560
they're not providing
the most potent stimulus.

1390
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,690
If they or you were to
move around in that water,

1391
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,730
what would happen is you'd
break up the thermal layer

1392
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,000
and that you actually
experience that as much colder.

1393
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,140
So if you really want to
push the resilience aspect,

1394
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,070
or for instance, if you want
to use a given temperature

1395
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,300
that you're comfortable in,

1396
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,540
but that you want to increase the stimulus

1397
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,390
and you want to get some more benefit

1398
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,190
for mental resilience training,

1399
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,600
well then get into the cold water,

1400
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,850
move your body around continuously,

1401
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:55,370
but try and keep your mind still,

1402
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,590
or even do some sort of cognitive task.

1403
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,200
So as you're starting to realize,

1404
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,360
there are a bunch of different variables

1405
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,240
that you can play with while maintaining

1406
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,160
the same temperature of
water and in doing so,

1407
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,650
really keep you in the zone of what should

1408
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,850
and absolutely has to be safe for you

1409
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:13,160
without having to just
continually drop the temperature

1410
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,750
from say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33

1411
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,670
because as I mentioned before,

1412
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,310
eventually you're going to bottom out.

1413
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,750
So if you're one of those
people that likes to look tough

1414
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,930
or really relaxed while
you're in the ice bath

1415
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:24,120
or cold water immersion,

1416
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,553
just realize that you're
actually cheating yourself out

1417
00:57:26,553 --> 00:57:28,370
of part of the stimulus.

1418
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:31,470
Keep those limbs moving and of course,

1419
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,640
limbs under the water, feet and hands

1420
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,770
is going to be a more potent stimulus

1421
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,450
than hands and feet out for reasons

1422
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,210
that should be obvious based
on what we talked about

1423
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,540
in terms of glabrous skin cooling.

1424
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,570
Keep those submerged, move your body,

1425
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,080
maybe move your knees up
and down, pedal your feet

1426
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,120
and trust me, it's going
to feel a lot colder

1427
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,300
than were you to remain stone still.

1428
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,500
Another very common question

1429
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,760
is how often to do
deliberate cold exposure.

1430
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,370
It's tough to make a
recommendation on that

1431
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,770
based on any peer reviewed study

1432
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,740
although there are a few in
humans that point to a threshold

1433
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,550
of 11 minutes total per week.

1434
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,440
So that's total throughout the week

1435
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,650
divided into two or four sessions

1436
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,580
of two or three minutes or so.

1437
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,380
Now that 11 minute cutoff
is not a strict threshold

1438
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,150
and is actually geared more
towards increases in metabolism,

1439
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,980
we'll get into this a little
bit later in the episode,

1440
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,640
but I think the 11 minute threshold,

1441
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,260
meaning 11 minutes total
of deliberate cold exposure

1442
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,460
per week is a pretty good number to use

1443
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,970
if you need a number in
order to keep you consistent.

1444
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,430
But as we talked about earlier,

1445
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,530
some of you are going
to be in the ice bath

1446
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:42,070
or cold immersion or cold
shower for one minute,

1447
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,170
others of you will be
in there for 10 minutes,

1448
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:47,590
depending on how frequent
and how high, if you will,

1449
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,180
those walls of adrenaline are coming.

1450
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,020
So for some of you,

1451
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,300
getting into a cold shower
for three minutes total

1452
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,530
for the whole week will
represent a tremendous

1453
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,080
achievement in terms of
willpower and overcoming

1454
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,380
the resistance to doing
that, overcoming those walls.

1455
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,000
For others of you, three
minutes is nothing.

1456
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,920
So what do I recommend,

1457
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,110
I recommend that you get at
least 11 minutes total per week,

1458
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,280
but at the point where
11 minutes total per week

1459
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,180
is very easy for you,

1460
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,810
where is no longer representing

1461
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,210
a significant mental challenge,

1462
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,130
meaning you're not experiencing
many of these walls,

1463
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,790
you're excited to get into
the cold shower immersion,

1464
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,610
you're going through it easily,
you're cruising basically.

1465
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:27,850
Then I would say either
lower the temperature safely,

1466
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,430
of course, extend the
duration safely, of course,

1467
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,880
or increase the frequency
so that you're doing this

1468
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,690
perhaps every day or
maybe five days a week

1469
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:37,550
or three days a week.

1470
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,370
I personally get tremendous benefit

1471
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:42,480
from doing deliberate cold
exposure three times a week

1472
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,600
and using the walls method
that I described earlier

1473
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,480
as my gauge for how long to stay in

1474
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,360
and typically that means that
I'm staying in for anywhere

1475
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,770
from two minutes to
six minutes per session

1476
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,800
and that averages out to about

1477
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,630
11 to 15 minutes total per week.

1478
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,900
So again, I do not think that
you need to be super strict

1479
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,240
about these guidelines.

1480
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,140
It's most important when
embracing a protocol A,

1481
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,260
that you do it safely,

1482
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,380
but secondarily that
you do it consistently.

1483
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,170
So find what you can do consistently

1484
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,460
and then vary the parameters

1485
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,380
that will allow you to continue to do

1486
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,400
deliberate cold exposure consistently,

1487
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,520
regardless of whether or not
you have access to a shower

1488
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,410
or cold immersion, et cetera.

1489
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,430
So we've been talking about mental effects

1490
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,300
and the use of deliberate cold exposure

1491
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,090
for sake of building resilience,

1492
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,660
which I do believe can
be tremendously powerful.

1493
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,070
Look, it's no coincidence
that the screening

1494
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,050
and the training for Navy Seals

1495
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:40,110
involves a lot of exposure to cold water.

1496
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,820
One could argue that it is deliberate

1497
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,770
because they elect to go to buds,

1498
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,440
but when they get into
the cold water at buds

1499
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,420
is dictated by the
instructors and the reason

1500
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,300
they use cold water
exposure as the stressor

1501
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,230
is that it does offer considerable leeway

1502
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:58,050
in terms of duration and temperature,

1503
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,820
in terms of how you can
use it as a stressor

1504
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:04,010
whereas things like heat don't
offer much variable space

1505
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:05,160
as we say.

1506
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,690
There isn't a lot of room
beyond which you start injuring

1507
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:10,760
or even killing people by using heat.

1508
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,570
So there are a lot of forms
of stressors out there,

1509
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,540
but cold is one that we can titrate,

1510
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,470
that we can adjust in
ways that can allow us

1511
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:21,470
to continually build up and
or maintain mental toughness.

1512
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,630
Now, deliberate cold exposure
also has many effects

1513
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:28,800
on chemicals other than
norepinephrine and epinephrine,

1514
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,050
most notably the neuromodulator dopamine,

1515
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,450
which is involved in elevating our mood,

1516
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:38,170
making us feel energized and
enhancing our ability to focus.

1517
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,210
And that has a lot to do
with how dopamine engages us

1518
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,120
in motivated states,

1519
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,240
tends to narrow our
thinking in our behavior

1520
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,010
into a particular trench
of goal-directed behavior.

1521
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,590
If you want to learn more about dopamine,

1522
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:52,410
you can learn a lot about dopamine

1523
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:55,330
in our episode about dopamine,
it's at hubermanlab.com.

1524
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,420
You can find it, it's a
two and a half hour plus

1525
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,990
kind of deep dive into
all things dopamine,

1526
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,943
focus, motivation, et cetera.

1527
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,750
Deliberate cold exposure
has a very powerful effect

1528
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,100
on the release of dopamine
in our brain and body.

1529
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,360
And this is one of the main
reasons why people continue

1530
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,113
to do deliberate cold exposure.

1531
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,210
Basically it makes us feel good

1532
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,300
and it continues to make us feel good

1533
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,650
even after we get out
of the cold environment.

1534
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,490
In fact, some people would say

1535
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,020
they don't feel good in
the cold environment,

1536
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:27,930
it's all stress for them,

1537
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,180
but afterwards they feel great.

1538
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,330
One of our previous
guests, Dr. Anna Lembke,

1539
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,390
who's a medical doctor
at Stanford University

1540
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:37,320
School of Medicine, she's
a close colleague of mine,

1541
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,430
described the use dopamine
in her book, Dopamine Nation,

1542
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,370
an incredible book about
addiction and dopamine

1543
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,470
I should mention.

1544
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:48,470
And the use of dopamine
elicited by cold water exposure

1545
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,640
by one of her patients.

1546
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,860
What I'm referring to is the
fact that one of her patients

1547
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,130
helped themselves get
and stay sober off drugs

1548
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:01,040
by using deliberate cold
exposure to increase dopamine.

1549
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,130
So a healthier form of dopamine release

1550
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:07,060
than they were engaged in
prior to getting sober.

1551
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,930
Now, the basis for dopamine release

1552
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,490
in response to cold exposure

1553
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,370
is that the catecholamines,
norepinephrine,

1554
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,590
epinephrine and dopamine
tend to be co-released

1555
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,700
by the same sorts of stimuli,

1556
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,410
but most stressors and
in particular things

1557
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,850
that evoke stress or our
feelings of stress internally

1558
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:28,020
that we don't like do
not increase dopamine.

1559
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,560
They only increase
norepinephrine and epinephrine,

1560
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,240
but deliberate cold exposure

1561
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,050
seems to cause a dramatic
increase in dopamine.

1562
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,860
And this has actually been substantiated

1563
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,180
in a really beautiful study entitled

1564
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,730
human physiological responses

1565
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:44,670
to immersion into water
of different temperatures.

1566
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,990
The first author is Sramek.

1567
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,090
I'm almost certainly
pronouncing that poorly

1568
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:54,230
and if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K.

1569
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,820
This was published in the European Journal

1570
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,460
of Applied Physiology in the year 2000,

1571
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,700
really a beautiful
study, I love this study.

1572
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,740
They took people and they
had them sit in chairs

1573
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,750
underwater but their head was
out and so they were immersed

1574
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:11,750
up to the neck in either of
three different temperatures.

1575
01:04:12,194 --> 01:04:16,260
32 degrees Celsius, which
is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,

1576
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,370
20 degrees Celsius, which
is 68 degrees Fahrenheit,

1577
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:23,760
or 14 degrees Celsius, which
is 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit.

1578
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,420
So not super cold, but then what they did

1579
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,010
is they measured people's core
body temperature throughout.

1580
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:31,697
They measured their metabolism

1581
01:04:31,697 --> 01:04:33,750
and they looked at serum levels

1582
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,820
of things like norepinephrine,
epinephrine, dopamine,

1583
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,410
and cortisol, serum
meaning within the blood.

1584
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:42,283
So a really nice and quite thorough study.

1585
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,270
There were not a huge number
of subjects in the study,

1586
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:48,500
but nonetheless, it was
a very thorough study

1587
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,630
in terms of the number of
variables that they explored.

1588
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,050
So I just want to briefly highlight

1589
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:57,760
some of what they saw or what
they observed in this study.

1590
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,680
First of all, all the
groups were in the water

1591
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,520
of a given temperature for one hour,

1592
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,260
which is much longer than most

1593
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,120
of the deliberate cold exposure protocols

1594
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,500
that anyone is using at home.

1595
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,240
I mean, maybe you're taking
one hour long cold showers,

1596
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,460
maybe you're getting into
the ice bath for an hour

1597
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,540
although I don't recommend that.

1598
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,840
I think you'd probably get
badly hypothermic or maybe

1599
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,470
you're getting into a cold water immersion

1600
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,530
for some period of time,

1601
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,010
but I have a hard time imagining
that it would be an hour

1602
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,160
and I don't suggest
that if it's very cold.

1603
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,420
So this study focused on actually somewhat

1604
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,840
moderately cool temperatures,

1605
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,990
not what I think most
people would consider

1606
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,680
very, very cold temperatures,

1607
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,410
but extended the duration
for quite a while.

1608
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:41,240
So again, 32 degree Celsius,

1609
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,100
20 degree Celsius or 14 degree Celsius.

1610
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,730
Here's what they observed.

1611
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:48,780
The group that was immersed up to the neck

1612
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,960
in 32 degrees Celsius, that
is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,

1613
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,420
water did not experience
a shift in metabolism

1614
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,330
nor a significant increase in dopamine,

1615
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,070
norepinephrine or these
other catecholamines.

1616
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,670
The group that was in 20 degree Celsius,

1617
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,400
meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit,

1618
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,570
water for an hour
experienced a 93% increase

1619
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,380
in metabolic rate, which is remarkable

1620
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,960
given that the water wasn't that cold

1621
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,540
and yet an hour is a pretty
long time to be in there.

1622
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,340
And again, it speaks
to the dramatic effect

1623
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,650
of heat transfer that water
has, which I mentioned earlier,

1624
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:27,390
as opposed to being out
in the air at 68 degrees,

1625
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,610
it would certainly not cause that increase

1626
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,583
in metabolic rate.

1627
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,020
The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius,

1628
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,840
meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,

1629
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,830
water for an hour experienced
a 350% increase in metabolism.

1630
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:45,290
So huge increases in metabolism.

1631
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:48,720
Now the most interesting data to me,

1632
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,560
at least in terms of mental effects

1633
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,450
of deliberate cold exposure,

1634
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:57,450
were that the plasma or serum
levels of norepinephrine

1635
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,660
in the blood increased 530%.

1636
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,380
These are huge increases in norepinephrine

1637
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,270
so it suggests that this
is a stressful stimulus

1638
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:10,070
at least neurochemically
speaking, stressful,

1639
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:12,350
despite the fact that
it's not super super cold,

1640
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,870
although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,

1641
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:19,870
14 degrees Celsius it's
not a warm environment,

1642
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,610
but it's not a ultra,
ultra cold environment,

1643
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,960
but an hour is a very
long time to be in there.

1644
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,600
The subjects also
experienced a 250% increase

1645
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,100
in dopamine concentrations,

1646
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,130
which while not 530% as
it was with norepinephrine

1647
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:40,670
is still a very large increase

1648
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,550
in baseline levels of dopamine.

1649
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,460
And what was interesting is
that those increases in dopamine

1650
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,250
persisted for a very long
period of time afterwards,

1651
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,530
even out to two hours.

1652
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,440
And they stopped the
study after 120 minutes

1653
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,230
of getting out of the
cold, but nonetheless,

1654
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:01,830
these increases in norepinephrine
are huge and long lasting

1655
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,370
and these increases in dopamine

1656
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,840
are very large and long lasting.

1657
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,910
And I do believe that these
documented effects in humans

1658
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:13,060
explain much of the enhancement
of attention and of feelings

1659
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:16,430
of wellbeing and mood that
people typically experience

1660
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,120
after doing deliberate cold exposure.

1661
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,779
And the reason I say that is that

1662
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:23,629
if you were to go back to the episode

1663
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,770
that I did on dopamine,

1664
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,220
or you were to go back to the episode

1665
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,770
that I did with Dr. Anna Lembke
on addiction and dopamine,

1666
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,880
what you would find is
that increases in dopamine

1667
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,880
of the sort evoked by
deliberate cold exposure

1668
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,140
are actually very similar
to the kinds of increases

1669
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,439
in dopamine that are elicited
by things like nicotine

1670
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,209
or from other behaviors

1671
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,960
that are known to be
addictive and bad for us

1672
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,090
because they lead to
other effects on the brain

1673
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,290
and body that we simply don't want.

1674
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:53,859
And yet deliberate cold
exposure provided is done safely

1675
01:08:53,859 --> 01:08:57,469
can create similar if not
greater increases in dopamine

1676
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,889
that are not just fleeting,
that don't just occur during,

1677
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:05,220
say the consumption of some
deleterious drug or activity,

1678
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,819
but that are very long lasting
and that can be leveraged

1679
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:11,859
toward activities other than
deliberate cold exposure.

1680
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:13,139
So I want to emphasize this.

1681
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,149
I'm not suggesting

1682
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,839
that people do deliberate cold
exposure for an hour a day.

1683
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,330
And unfortunately there
are not many studies yet

1684
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:23,830
exploring how shorter colder temperature

1685
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:27,109
environment exposure, say
one minute or three minutes

1686
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:32,109
or six minutes at 55
degrees or at 50 degrees,

1687
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,700
whether or not that leads to similar,

1688
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,819
greater or reduced levels of
dopamine in the brain and body.

1689
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,619
And yet almost everybody who
does deliberate cold exposure

1690
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,520
will say yeah, it was stressful.

1691
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,399
I didn't enjoy it, or I
eventually grew to like it,

1692
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,669
but that I always feel better afterwards

1693
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:52,710
and then that feeling last
a very long period of time.

1694
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:54,620
And I think it's almost certain

1695
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,860
that those experiences that people report

1696
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,850
relate to these increases in dopamine

1697
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:02,050
and in concert with the
increases in norepinephrine

1698
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,530
also explain the other effect
that's commonly reported,

1699
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:06,980
which is an enhancement in mental acuity

1700
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,190
and the ability to focus.

1701
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,770
Now, here we can extrapolate to the study

1702
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,900
that I discussed at the
early part of the episode,

1703
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,370
where I was talking about the use of

1704
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,150
short 15 minute exercise,

1705
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,800
kind of moderate intensity exercise

1706
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,780
and how that was shown to
increase levels of energy

1707
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,800
and mental acuity

1708
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,500
in these working memory,
visual attention tasks.

1709
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,350
And there, again, we
have to assume somewhat

1710
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,490
because they weren't doing
neurochemical measurements,

1711
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:35,270
but we can reasonably assume
that those improvements

1712
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:37,520
in cognitive performance were due

1713
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,760
at least in part to the
increase in catecholamines

1714
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,750
known to a company, moderate
intensity zone two cardio.

1715
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,830
So what you're starting
to see here is a theme.

1716
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:49,280
The theme is that virtually any stimulus

1717
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,130
that delivers more norepinephrine,

1718
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,210
epinephrine and dopamine to our system

1719
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,680
will sharpen our mental
acuity and elevate our mood

1720
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,310
and will do so for some period of time.

1721
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:00,520
Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out,

1722
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,520
is a very potent way to
increase these catecholamines,

1723
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,740
this category of chemicals
and thereby to improve mood,

1724
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:09,190
mental acuity and levels of alertness.

1725
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:13,070
And as we'll next see, it
not only has that effect,

1726
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,170
which can be very
beneficial for many people

1727
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,940
in a bunch of different circumstances,

1728
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:21,000
but it also has the positive
effects that many people seek

1729
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,350
in terms of metabolism, in
lowering inflammation in the body

1730
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,620
and other physiological effects as well.

1731
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,453
And forgive me,

1732
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:30,120
I was almost ready to move on to effects

1733
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,780
of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism

1734
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:34,330
and inflammation and so forth,

1735
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,690
but I neglected to point
out one of the other

1736
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:39,950
very interesting aspects of the study

1737
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:41,720
showing deliberate cold exposure

1738
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,210
can increase in
norepinephrine and dopamine,

1739
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:48,180
which is that they observed
no significant increases

1740
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,300
in the stress hormone cortisol

1741
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,670
and that is both surprising,
interesting, and important

1742
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:57,500
because what it means is
that the quality of stress

1743
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,780
that deliberate cold exposure
is creating in the body

1744
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,560
is likely to be one of
what we call use stress.

1745
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,420
Hans Selye, the great physiologist,

1746
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,830
won a Nobel Prize for
distinguishing between distress,

1747
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,230
which is stress in the brain and body

1748
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:16,600
that causes the release
of things like cortisol

1749
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,010
along with the other catecholamines,

1750
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:20,780
and that we experience as
negative happening to us

1751
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,910
and can lead to negative health outcomes.

1752
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:25,440
And he distinguished that from eustress,

1753
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,920
which was stress that we now understand

1754
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,590
is associated with increases
in things like norepinephrine

1755
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:34,010
and dopamine, but no
increases or minimal increases

1756
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:37,600
in cortisol, and that can lead
to positive health outcomes.

1757
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,330
So it appears that deliberate
cold exposure can create

1758
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:44,830
what we call or what Hans
Selye called eustress.

1759
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,990
In other words, it can create
a condition in the brain

1760
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:49,900
and body in which we
are stressing ourselves,

1761
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,240
we are training up resilience,

1762
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,180
and yet we are creating
a neurochemical milieu

1763
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,420
that actually has many health benefits.

1764
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,630
Now I'd like to shift our attention

1765
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:00,830
to the effects of deliberate
cold exposure on metabolism.

1766
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:03,350
And I'd like to start by detailing a study

1767
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,180
that was performed on humans

1768
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,790
and published just at
the end of last year.

1769
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,290
The title of the study is altered

1770
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,890
brown fat thermoregulation,

1771
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:13,670
and enhanced cold induced thermogenesis

1772
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:16,020
in young, healthy winter swimming men.

1773
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,370
And I should point out
that while the study

1774
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:20,630
was only performed on male subjects,

1775
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,880
there's no reason to
think that the effects

1776
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,190
that they discovered
would only pertain to men.

1777
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,160
I would hope that they would
also do a study on women

1778
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,840
at some point in the future,

1779
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,900
but the effects that they describe

1780
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,740
are very basic core
physiological processes.

1781
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,260
What they did is they looked
at at deliberate cold exposure

1782
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,760
in this group of young men,

1783
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,000
and they used that 11
minute threshold per week.

1784
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,820
So in other words, they had
them get into cold water

1785
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,200
for approximately 11 minutes per week.

1786
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,640
And again, that's 11
minutes total per week.

1787
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,030
They divided that into two sessions

1788
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:58,800
although in speaking with the
first author of this study,

1789
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,990
Dr. Susanna Søberg,

1790
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,350
I learned that it
probably is not important

1791
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,540
that it be two sessions,

1792
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,310
it could be three or even four sessions,

1793
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,963
as long as it reaches
that 11 minute threshold.

1794
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:11,210
What they discovered was

1795
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,860
that by going into
these cold environments,

1796
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,010
in this case cold water
immersion up to the neck,

1797
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:21,290
for 11 minutes total per week,

1798
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,830
that these men experienced increases

1799
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,700
in so-called brown fat thermogenesis,

1800
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,750
I'll talk more about
what that is in a moment,

1801
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,840
and increases in core body temperature

1802
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,950
that translate to increases
in core body metabolism.

1803
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:37,860
Now, the overall increases
in core body metabolism

1804
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:42,860
that they experienced
were not extremely large.

1805
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,640
They were statistically significant,

1806
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,990
but they weren't extremely large.

1807
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:50,430
However, the changes in brown fat stores

1808
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,150
are perhaps what's most
interesting about this study

1809
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,470
and I'll tell you why.

1810
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:57,620
The metabolic increases of
deliberate cold exposure

1811
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,330
are both acute meaning
happening in the short term.

1812
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,950
When you get into the cold
and immediately after,

1813
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,470
one does experience an
increase in core metabolism,

1814
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,420
you burn some calories, in other words,

1815
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:14,560
and while those might not be
very significant increases,

1816
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,770
or I should say they can be
statistically significant,

1817
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,740
but they are not enormously large numbers

1818
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,670
of calories burned,

1819
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:27,240
the longer lasting effects
of deliberate cold exposure

1820
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,710
on metabolism seem to take
place by changes that occur

1821
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:34,130
in the types of fat that
we store in our body

1822
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,700
and the way that that fat
impacts our metabolism

1823
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,173
at other times throughout
the 24 hour cycle.

1824
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:44,690
This actually has a
somewhat anecdotal basis,

1825
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,930
in particular in Scandinavia.

1826
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:49,470
I don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish,

1827
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:51,200
nor do I speak Norwegian,

1828
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,000
but I do have Danish relatives

1829
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,440
and they were able to help me decipher

1830
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,060
a common Swedish saying,

1831
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,160
which essentially
translates to the fact that

1832
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,343
in preparation for the summer, they say,

1833
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,030
one should expose themselves
to warm environments

1834
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:12,280
so that one is comfortable
in warm environments

1835
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,170
in the summer.

1836
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:16,500
That's one half of this
traditional Swedish

1837
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,970
and also Danish saying.

1838
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:22,420
The other half of this
traditional Danish-Swedish saying

1839
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,830
is that in preparation for winter,

1840
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,800
in order to not feel too
cold in cold environments,

1841
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,330
one should prepare for those in the fall

1842
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,270
by not wearing a jacket
and exposing one's self

1843
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,240
to cold environments.

1844
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,170
Now, of course, this is just
anecdotal cultural lore,

1845
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:42,250
but it actually has a physiological basis,

1846
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:46,430
which is by exposing
oneself to cold environments

1847
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:50,080
on a repeated basis in
anticipation of exposure

1848
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,140
to more extreme cold environments,

1849
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,000
one can feel more comfortable

1850
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,040
in those extreme cold environments.

1851
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,210
And that's exactly what they observed

1852
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,430
in this study by Søberg et al.

1853
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:03,980
The men felt more
comfortable in extreme cold

1854
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:07,410
if they had trained through
deliberate cold exposure,

1855
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,920
which might not seem surprising at all,

1856
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,310
but based on what we talked about earlier,

1857
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:16,070
whereby deliberate cold
exposure evokes this discomfort

1858
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,670
and this experience of
norepinephrine release,

1859
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:21,990
at least in the short term,
then you would say, well,

1860
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:24,110
shouldn't that deliberate
cold exposure also

1861
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,280
make them feel uncomfortable

1862
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,720
like they really want to get out?

1863
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,280
Well, that is true

1864
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,460
in the beginning of a deliberate
cold exposure protocol,

1865
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,510
meaning in the first week
or in the second week

1866
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,060
or the third week, but what one finds

1867
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,870
and what you will find if you do

1868
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:41,190
deliberate cold exposure
consistently is that you will then

1869
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:44,600
become more comfortable
at cold temperatures

1870
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,750
away from the deliberate cold exposure.

1871
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,210
So whereas you might have
previously been the person

1872
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:51,210
who is always cold in the
room with air conditioning,

1873
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:54,030
or always seeking a sweater,
always wanting to bundle up,

1874
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:56,060
you will be more comfortable
in those cold environments.

1875
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:00,020
And the reason for that
is well substantiated

1876
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:03,290
from this study and from animal studies

1877
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:06,260
whereby deliberate cold exposure

1878
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,560
converts one particular kind of fat cell,

1879
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,120
the white fat cell,

1880
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,320
which is a very low metabolic output cell.

1881
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,450
It's basically a storage site for energy

1882
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:21,290
in the body fat cells to a
different type of fat cell,

1883
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:24,440
which is the beige fat cell called beige

1884
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,030
because it's actually
beige or slightly brown

1885
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:30,470
under the microscope, or
even to brown fat cells,

1886
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:32,950
which are very dark under
the microscope and dark

1887
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,090
because they contain mitochondria

1888
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,530
and are very metabolically
and thermogenetically active.

1889
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:43,890
In other words, white fat
doesn't burn many calories.

1890
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:45,560
It's basically a storage site.

1891
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,650
It's a bank account for energy.

1892
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:50,020
It's filled with lipids,

1893
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,530
and those lipids can be used
if the body needs energy

1894
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:55,720
and if it goes into a caloric deficit.

1895
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,700
Beige fat and brown fat
acts as sort of a furnace

1896
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:03,430
or the sort of fat that
you would find in a kindle,

1897
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:06,130
a fuel that can increase
core body temperature.

1898
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:09,550
So beige fat and brown fat is very good

1899
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:13,360
at raising our metabolism
and helps burn white fat.

1900
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,193
Now of course,

1901
01:19:14,193 --> 01:19:18,380
it does that only in the
context of a caloric deficit,

1902
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:22,010
but it can actually help
create that caloric deficit.

1903
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:24,610
Having more beige fat and brown fat

1904
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:27,880
can increase your overall core
metabolism, in other words,

1905
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,330
the number of calories
that you burn per day,

1906
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:31,730
and therefore the number of calories

1907
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:34,733
that you need to either
maintain or to lose weight.

1908
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:39,180
The simple translation of
this is that getting into

1909
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:43,080
cold water for a total of
11 minutes, perhaps more,

1910
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,020
but at least 11 minutes per week

1911
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,750
divided into two or four sessions

1912
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,550
can increase your core metabolism in part

1913
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:54,240
by increasing your beige
and brown fat stores.

1914
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,440
And we know how that works
at least in animal models

1915
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,310
and there's now reason to suspect

1916
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:02,350
that the exact same mechanisms
are occurring in humans.

1917
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:05,920
The primary way in which
deliberate cold exposure converts

1918
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,540
white fat cells into
these more metabolically

1919
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,730
thermogenetically active
metabolism increasing

1920
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:16,730
beige and brown fat cells
is because norepinephrine

1921
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,290
released when we get into
the cold binds to receptors

1922
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:25,870
on the surface of white
fat cells and activates

1923
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:30,040
downstream pathways such as UCP1,

1924
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,670
so this is an uncoupling protein one,

1925
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,550
that acts on the mitochondrial
metabolism of cells

1926
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:39,110
and increases the mitochondrial
output of those cells

1927
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,380
and the mitochondrial
density of those cells.

1928
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,260
In other words,

1929
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:46,180
it takes a cell that has
a kind of a weak engine

1930
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,910
or no engine for generating energy.

1931
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,040
Although every cell has some mitochondria,

1932
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,650
it takes cells that have
very few mitochondria

1933
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:56,360
and increases the engine size.

1934
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,010
It kind of stokes the furnace
of those particular cells

1935
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:03,510
and actually can change gene
expression in those cells.

1936
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,680
So that's what's really interesting.

1937
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,460
Deliberate cold exposure causes
increases in norepinephrine.

1938
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,720
which bind to receptors on the
surfaces of white fat cells,

1939
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,340
which triggers the release
of things like UCP1.

1940
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:19,600
It also causes the release
of things like P-part gamma,

1941
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,100
and co-factor PGC1.

1942
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,570
I'm going to refer you to a review

1943
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:25,480
if you want to learn more about these.

1944
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,870
For those of you that
don't want to learn more,

1945
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:29,640
all you need to know is that
the downstream of all that

1946
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,440
are increases in
mitochondria and metabolism

1947
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:36,290
and actual genetic changes
in the white fat cells

1948
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:39,520
that convert them into
beige and brown fat cells.

1949
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,430
This is especially important for adults

1950
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:46,430
because babies and young
children actually don't have

1951
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:47,780
the ability to shiver

1952
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:51,570
or they have a less
robust capacity to shiver.

1953
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,460
Very small babies really can't shiver

1954
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,410
so they have a lot of brown
fat in order to keep them warm.

1955
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,380
Young children eventually
develop the ability to shiver

1956
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,950
and maintain these brown fat stores,

1957
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:06,020
mainly around the clavicles,
the heart, the upper spine,

1958
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,690
and in the upper back.

1959
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:10,880
And it's no coincidence that
kids can often run around

1960
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,580
with a minimal of clothing
and be comfortable

1961
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:15,273
in environments that
adults would be cold in.

1962
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:21,050
As life goes on, we tend to
lose beige and brown fat,

1963
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:23,720
but this mechanism that I'm referring to

1964
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,700
points to the plasticity of white fat,

1965
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,930
meaning the ability for
white fat to actually convert

1966
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:31,000
its identity into this
metabolically thermogenetically

1967
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,950
enhancing form of beige and brown fat.

1968
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,560
So deliberate cold
exposure is a terrific way

1969
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,470
to increase your core metabolism

1970
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,300
and oftentimes critics will say, well,

1971
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,580
the increase in metabolism
isn't that significant

1972
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,470
although I do want to point out again,

1973
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:49,470
the 93% and 350% increases in metabolism

1974
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,080
from that previous study.

1975
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,770
But critics then will say, well,

1976
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:58,770
that doesn't really translate
to that big of a caloric burn

1977
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,980
during the deliberate cold exposure.

1978
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,700
But to that, you should say, ah,

1979
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,870
but that's only limiting your optics

1980
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,330
to just a portion of the effects

1981
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:09,130
of deliberate cold exposure
because deliberate cold exposure

1982
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,860
can also convert white fat
to beige fat and brown fat

1983
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:17,040
and lead to these more lasting
increases in metabolism.

1984
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,737
So for any of you interested
in increasing your metabolism

1985
01:23:19,737 --> 01:23:22,520
and or being comfortable
in cold environments

1986
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,250
and or being comfortable in terms of

1987
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,550
being able to combat stress mentally,

1988
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:31,000
deliberate cold exposure, I
do believe is a powerful tool.

1989
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,390
And there is simply no reason
why you couldn't and shouldn't

1990
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,990
use the same protocols
that I described earlier

1991
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,970
for building resilience
to increase metabolism.

1992
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:43,450
Provided you're hitting that
11 minute per week threshold,

1993
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:47,170
you ought to be stimulating
both mechanism increases

1994
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:51,850
in resilience and increases
in core metabolism.

1995
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:52,683
As I mentioned earlier,

1996
01:23:52,683 --> 01:23:55,580
most of the detailed studies
on the conversion of white fat

1997
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,860
to beige fat and brown fat
through the use of cold

1998
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,560
have been done in animal models,

1999
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,500
but the human data are starting to emerge.

2000
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,260
And if you'd like to do the
deep dive into these mechanisms,

2001
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:07,240
things like UCP1, P-part gamma, et cetera,

2002
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,680
there's a beautiful review
that was published recently

2003
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:10,620
in the journal cell,

2004
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,160
which is one of the three apex journals,

2005
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,710
nature, science, cell.

2006
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:17,220
And the title of that paper
is adipose tissue plasticity

2007
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,170
in health and disease.

2008
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:19,460
I love this review.

2009
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,820
It has beautiful diagrams
detailing all of the pathways

2010
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,500
from cold to norepinephrine through UCP1

2011
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,140
downstream of things like cyclic AMP.

2012
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,280
If none of those names
mean anything to you,

2013
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,130
don't worry about it.

2014
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:32,870
You certainly don't need
to know these mechanisms

2015
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:35,810
to benefit from deliberate
cold exposure protocols.

2016
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,190
If those names do mean something to you,

2017
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:41,200
or you are interested in
exploring the downstream effects

2018
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,630
of deliberate cold
exposure and something else

2019
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,620
that's really nice that's
covered in this paper

2020
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,100
is how deliberate cold exposure interacts

2021
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,770
with fasted states and fed states.

2022
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:54,330
I think you'll also find
this review very interesting.

2023
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:56,370
I don't want to go too
deeply into fasted states

2024
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,140
and fed states right now,

2025
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,490
suffice to say that when we are fasted,

2026
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:03,070
meaning when we have an eaten
for some period of time,

2027
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:06,080
our baseline levels of norepinephrine

2028
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,000
and epinephrine are already elevated.

2029
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,390
And so cold exposure at those times

2030
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:14,900
ought to have an even
greater effect on metabolism

2031
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,510
and resilience and so on.

2032
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:20,440
So for you fasters or your
intermittent fasters out there,

2033
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,890
if you really want to get fancy,

2034
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:24,130
you can do your deliberate cold exposure

2035
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,630
when you are fasted.

2036
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,150
I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it

2037
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:29,500
with a very full stomach in any case.

2038
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,010
And as I mentioned before on this podcast,

2039
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:36,240
intermittent fasting is, but one way,

2040
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,580
and certainly there are other ways

2041
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:40,720
to limit total caloric intake
for sake of maintaining

2042
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,150
or losing weight if that's your goal.

2043
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,510
I know many people are using and benefit

2044
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,440
from intermittent fasting, however,

2045
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,700
and so it certainly can be combined

2046
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,540
with deliberate cold exposures in order

2047
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,040
to get even greater increases

2048
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,890
in norepinephrine and epinephrine.

2049
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:57,140
So for those of you that
are primarily interested

2050
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,610
in using deliberate cold exposure

2051
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:02,260
to increase dopamine levels
in your brain and body,

2052
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,550
you can also do a combined protocol

2053
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,170
whereby you ingest
caffeine 60 to 120 minutes

2054
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:11,770
before the deliberate cold exposure.

2055
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:14,700
This is based on a study
that I've talked about before

2056
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,040
entitled caffeine increases
striatal dopamine D-2,

2057
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,440
D-3 receptor availability
in the human brain.

2058
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,790
And as the title suggests,
this study was done on humans,

2059
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:27,580
looking at the density and or efficacy

2060
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,050
of these dopamine receptors

2061
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,830
in an area of the brain
called the striatum,

2062
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,540
which is involved in planning in action

2063
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,350
and also suppressing planning in action.

2064
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:37,630
It's involved very closely
with whether or not

2065
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:41,120
we can engage in behavior
and withhold behavior,

2066
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,270
the so-called go and no
go ways in the brain.

2067
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,627
Dopamine plays a critical role in that

2068
01:26:45,627 --> 01:26:48,373
and many other things
as well as you now know.

2069
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:52,670
So why would you want to ingest
caffeine 60 to 120 minutes

2070
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:55,050
before deliberate cold exposure?

2071
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:57,720
Well, as I talked about earlier,

2072
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,300
dopamine can increase quite substantially

2073
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,210
in response to deliberate cold exposure,

2074
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:04,050
but dopamine on its own
doesn't do anything,

2075
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,020
it has to bind to receptors

2076
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,720
and this paper shows quite definitively

2077
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,370
that ingesting caffeine in this case,

2078
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:12,400
it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine,

2079
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,200
which is about the dose of caffeine

2080
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,480
in two or three cups of coffee,

2081
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,600
it depends on the strength
of the coffee, of course,

2082
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,900
but it's not an outrageous
amount of caffeine,

2083
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:23,850
that increases the density and or efficacy

2084
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:24,683
of these receptors,

2085
01:27:24,683 --> 01:27:25,860
which you would allow that dopamine

2086
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,860
to have its greatest effect.

2087
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,160
And for those of you that want
to get really, really fancy,

2088
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,620
I suppose you could do this fasted

2089
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:35,047
so you get the further
increase in norepinephrine,

2090
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:37,240
then you get the dopamine
increase from the cold exposure,

2091
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,920
the binding of the dopamine.

2092
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,140
Although I do want to point
out that at some point,

2093
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,110
you start layering
together enough protocols

2094
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,710
that you would to be
spending your entire day

2095
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,120
trying to get this dopamine pulse

2096
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,600
and I would hope that you
would have other activities

2097
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,810
that you would engage in,

2098
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:53,810
but if you're getting up in
the morning and you're fasted

2099
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,070
because you haven't eaten all night

2100
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:57,380
and you have a cup of coffee,
and then 60 minutes later,

2101
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:00,540
you take your cold shower
or two hours later,

2102
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,930
you do your cold immersion
or your cold shower,

2103
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:04,760
you would be layering together

2104
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,950
these different mechanisms
of dopamine receptors,

2105
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,210
epinephrine and so forth in
a way that at least to me,

2106
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:12,500
doesn't seem incompatible
with having some other life

2107
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,090
like going to school and having
relationships, et cetera.

2108
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:16,770
And this increase in dopamine,

2109
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:20,780
particularly in the striatum
is not a trivial one.

2110
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,210
I do want to point out as the authors do

2111
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,900
that preclinical studies have shown

2112
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,380
that increases in striatal dopamine

2113
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,430
induced by things like modafinil,

2114
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:33,320
which is used to treat
ADHD and treat narcolepsy,

2115
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,180
is necessary for their
wake promoting actions.

2116
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,670
What this really says is that
just having elevated levels

2117
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:41,230
of dopamine from a drug
or from an ice bath,

2118
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:43,310
or what have you is not sufficient

2119
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,610
to get the effects of dopamine,

2120
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:47,410
you really need the
receptors to be available

2121
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,090
and you need those
receptors to be available

2122
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,480
in the appropriate density

2123
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,640
and you need those
receptors to be available

2124
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,350
in the appropriate density in
the striatum in particular.

2125
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,540
So I think there are a
number of reasons why

2126
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,600
if it's compatible with the
other aspects of your health,

2127
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,320
cause of course always
you have to consider this

2128
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,990
on a background of cardiovascular health

2129
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:05,200
and blood pressure, et cetera,

2130
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,290
that ingesting a cup or two of coffee

2131
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:11,290
an hour before your ice
bath may be fasted as well

2132
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:13,550
could be quite beneficial
for increasing dopamine

2133
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,690
over quite extended periods of time.

2134
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:18,290
A couple of key points that
you'll want to pay attention to

2135
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,300
in thinking about deliberate
cold exposure and metabolism.

2136
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,300
In the Søberg study,

2137
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:27,100
they also explored the use of
sauna and how to use sauna,

2138
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,450
meaning deliberate heat
in conjunction with cold.

2139
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,490
We are going to do an entire
episode about the use of heat

2140
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:34,700
for health and performance.

2141
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:38,800
So that is not the focus now, however,

2142
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,200
it does raise an important point

2143
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,150
that we do need to address at this moment,

2144
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:45,000
which is if you are using sauna

2145
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,340
or if you are taking warm showers

2146
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,090
or if you are simply using
deliberate cold exposure

2147
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,190
of any kind,

2148
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:54,060
should you get into the heat afterward

2149
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,840
or before or not at all?

2150
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,260
And this is where we can
point to the so-called

2151
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:02,380
Søberg principle, at least I
call it the Søberg principle,

2152
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,330
the Søberg principle named after
first author of this study,

2153
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:08,083
I referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg.

2154
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:12,980
In science, it is appropriate
to take a key piece of data

2155
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,510
and call it a principle

2156
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:16,540
if in fact it translates
to something larger,

2157
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,200
which I believe it does.

2158
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,410
It is generally not appropriate for people

2159
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:22,020
to name a principle after themselves

2160
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:25,430
although there are a few
scientists that have done that.

2161
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:27,050
So I have named it the Søberg principle,

2162
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:30,310
but I did that to give
it appropriate credit

2163
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:32,070
to Dr. Susanna Søberg,

2164
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:36,290
who discovered that and pointed
out quite appropriately,

2165
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:40,430
that to achieve the greatest
increases in metabolism

2166
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,760
through deliberate cold exposure,

2167
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:47,490
you want to force yourself
to reheat on your own

2168
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:49,280
after the deliberate cold exposure,

2169
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,160
meaning you wouldn't want
to go from the cold shower

2170
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,870
to a hot shower or from
the cold shower to a sauna.

2171
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,170
Rather if you were going
to start with a hot shower

2172
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:58,770
or you're going to start with a sauna

2173
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:01,030
that you would end with the cold,

2174
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:03,830
and then you would reheat naturally.

2175
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:06,930
Now I personally take a cold
shower a few times a week

2176
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,330
or do cold immersion

2177
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:10,730
and because I'm not specifically focused

2178
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:13,920
on increasing metabolism,
although I probably should be,

2179
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,490
that's not what I'm using it for now,

2180
01:31:16,490 --> 01:31:18,840
I will take a hot shower
afterwards and in doing so,

2181
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,920
I'm short circuiting

2182
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,810
some of the further metabolic
increases that I would achieve

2183
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,210
were I to just end with the cold.

2184
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:27,750
So the Søberg principle is

2185
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:31,550
if you want to increase your
metabolism, end with cold,

2186
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:34,600
and we can take this
a step further and say

2187
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,010
that if you want to use
deliberate cold exposure

2188
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:40,980
to increase metabolism,
that you should make sure

2189
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,640
that you get to the
point where you shiver.

2190
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,500
And the reason in for
this is that there are

2191
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,110
a series of studies, but in particular,

2192
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,000
one study published in the journal Nature,

2193
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,770
excellent journal in the year 2018,

2194
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:56,770
showing that deliberate cold
exposure that evokes shivering

2195
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:00,840
from the muscles causes
the release of a molecule

2196
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,480
called succinate from the muscles

2197
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,410
and that succinate plays

2198
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:08,860
a key role in activating
brown fat thermogenesis,

2199
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:10,990
which you now have heard
about and understand

2200
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,140
as critical to the increases in metabolism

2201
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,890
caused by deliberate cold exposure.

2202
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:17,250
So what this means is if you want to

2203
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:19,160
increase your metabolism, end on cold,

2204
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,300
that's a Søberg principle
and as best you can,

2205
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,900
try and get to the point
where you are shivering

2206
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:27,400
either when you are in the cold exposure

2207
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,290
or immediately afterwards.

2208
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:32,620
Now one efficient way to do
this is to, for instance,

2209
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:36,120
you could get into the
cold shower for a minute

2210
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,970
or two minutes or three
minutes, uncomfortably cold,

2211
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,120
but safe to stay in.

2212
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,500
Remember that's our general rule of thumb.

2213
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,470
Then turn off the water and stand there,

2214
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:47,860
make sure that you're not holding yourself

2215
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:48,693
close to your body,

2216
01:32:48,693 --> 01:32:50,810
you're not hugging yourself
to try and keep yourself warm,

2217
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:53,960
but rather your limbs are
extended at your sides.

2218
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,900
And then if that fails to induce shiver

2219
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:59,710
than to turn on the cold water again,

2220
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:00,950
and then turn it off again,

2221
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,030
so alternating perhaps a
minute to three minutes

2222
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:05,560
of cold exposure followed
by a minute to three minutes

2223
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,690
of drying out in air

2224
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:10,650
and going back into the
cold exposure, et cetera.

2225
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:12,170
I can tell you this from experience,

2226
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,163
this is a pretty brutal protocol.

2227
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,730
If you have never tried
getting into an ice bath

2228
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:21,630
or cold water immersion
or shower for one minute

2229
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,370
and then getting out and
trying to stand there

2230
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:27,250
with your arms extended in cool
or cold air for one minute,

2231
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,810
and then getting back into the cold shower

2232
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:33,470
or water immersion, you are
in for an experience because

2233
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:36,110
even for those of you that
are pretty shiver resistant,

2234
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,270
you'll find that it is much, much harder

2235
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:41,920
to get out of that cold water
and stand there arms extended

2236
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,820
and drying off by evaporation,

2237
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:46,640
which further draws heat from the body

2238
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,300
than it is to wrap yourself in a towel,

2239
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,210
get in a warm shower or a sauna.

2240
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:54,090
So there's certainly no
requirement to end on cold.

2241
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:57,650
There's certainly no
requirement to induce shiver,

2242
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:59,340
but if your primary goal

2243
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,760
is to induce increases in metabolism,

2244
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,180
both in the short term
and in the long term,

2245
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,690
following the cold exposure,

2246
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:08,010
well then you'll want to end on cold

2247
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,570
and you'll want to find a way to shiver

2248
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:12,830
provided that the level of cold

2249
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:14,130
that you're exposing yourself to

2250
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:15,880
is still safe for you overall.

2251
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:16,713
So up until now,

2252
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:18,840
I've been talking about
deliberate cold exposure

2253
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,980
as a potent stimulus for the
release of norepinephrine

2254
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:24,430
in the brain and body and indeed it is,

2255
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:27,940
but the way I've been describing
it has been in the context

2256
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:31,870
of circulating plasma
levels of norepinephrine,

2257
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:33,720
meaning circulating within the blood.

2258
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:35,780
What I haven't mentioned,

2259
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:40,780
but is absolutely true is
that the fat cells themselves

2260
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:44,740
actually receive input from neurons.

2261
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,540
So there are neurons that
release norepinephrine

2262
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:51,100
in response to cold,
directly into the fat.

2263
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:55,100
So I want to give you this
picture of how the architecture

2264
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:55,933
of all this works,

2265
01:34:55,933 --> 01:34:58,020
because I think it can help you navigate

2266
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:01,810
and indeed build better deliberate
cold exposure protocols.

2267
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:05,360
Your adrenal glands release
norepinephrine and epinephrine.

2268
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,940
Your brain has sites within
it like the locus coeruleus

2269
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:12,050
that release norepinephrine
and epinephrine,

2270
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:16,230
but there are also neurons
within your skin that sense cold

2271
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:19,410
and other neurons that can
directly release norepinephrine

2272
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:22,680
into the fat stores and
cause those white fat cells

2273
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,420
to convert to beige and brown fat.

2274
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,960
And I think this particular
aspect of our physiology

2275
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,770
is often overlooked in studies.

2276
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:31,060
And when people say, oh,

2277
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,630
well the increases in
metabolism aren't that great,

2278
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,370
the circulating levels of norepinephrine,

2279
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:39,220
those are very large, but
they're very transient and so on,

2280
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:43,000
that fails to understand that neurons

2281
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,870
that actually sense cold are
in a position to communicate

2282
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:49,970
via other neurons
directly to the fat cells

2283
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:51,900
and release norepinephrine
into those fat cells,

2284
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:53,570
which as I pointed out earlier,

2285
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:55,570
set off a huge set of immediate

2286
01:35:55,570 --> 01:35:58,913
and long term cascades of
even gene expression changes.

2287
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:02,070
So the picture that I'd like
you to have in your mind

2288
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:04,450
is that when you get into the cold, yes,

2289
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:07,790
of course you experience
that as a experience of

2290
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:09,590
I don't want to do this,
I'm going to overcome this,

2291
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:11,330
I'm going to climb over these mental walls

2292
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:14,050
that represent adrenaline
release in my brain and body,

2293
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:18,120
but also that your fat
cells are receiving signals,

2294
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,837
norepinephrine signals that
are changing those fat cells

2295
01:36:20,837 --> 01:36:22,900
and the way that they metabolize energy.

2296
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,670
Now I'd like to shift
our attention to the use

2297
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:26,290
of deliberate cold exposure

2298
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,780
for sake of physical performance.

2299
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:30,450
And there are a lot of opinions out there

2300
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:32,480
about the use of deliberate cold,

2301
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,030
whether or not it should
be done for instance,

2302
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:36,200
before or after exercise,

2303
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:39,760
whether or not if done immediately
after strength training

2304
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,840
or hypertrophy training,

2305
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,490
meaning training designed to grow muscles

2306
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:44,380
or make them stronger,

2307
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,180
whether or not it can inhibit that process

2308
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,640
and so on and so forth.

2309
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,690
I think today in looking
over the literature

2310
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:52,750
and trying to bring forward the simplest

2311
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:53,630
and most straightforward,

2312
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:56,030
and yet scientifically grounded protocols,

2313
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:59,280
we can set up some general
guidelines that will allow most,

2314
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,520
if not, all of you to
still extract the benefits

2315
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,080
of deliberate cold exposure
on physical performance

2316
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,410
without getting too neurotic
about the exact timing,

2317
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:10,710
but for sake of discussion

2318
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:13,270
and because it's a prominent theme

2319
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,920
in many online communities,

2320
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,180
let's just start with
the big one out there,

2321
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:22,000
meaning the question of whether
or not doing an ice bath

2322
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,070
or doing deliberate cold
exposure or taking a cold shower

2323
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:28,310
after strength slash hypertrophy training,

2324
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,720
meaning training designed
to increase strength

2325
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:34,150
and or I should say the size of muscles

2326
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:37,840
will somehow short circuit
or diminish that process,

2327
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,890
whether or not it will reduce or eliminate

2328
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:41,700
those strength gains
and hypertrophy gains.

2329
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,080
And the short answer that
I was able to arrive at

2330
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,200
on the basis of a review
article that I'll talk about

2331
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,170
in a moment and some
other studies as well,

2332
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:56,170
is that if your main goal
is hypertrophy and strength,

2333
01:37:56,330 --> 01:38:00,500
it is probably best to
avoid cold water immersion

2334
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,370
and ice bath immersion in the four hours

2335
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:06,890
immediately following that strength

2336
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:08,690
and or hypertrophy training.

2337
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:12,910
Again, if your main goal
is to achieve hypertrophy

2338
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,940
or strength or some combination of those,

2339
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:20,200
probably best to avoid cold
water immersion up to the neck

2340
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,070
or ice bath immersion up to the neck

2341
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:26,120
immediately after strength
and hypertrophy training

2342
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:30,163
and extending out to about
four hours after that training.

2343
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:32,950
If you're really neurotic about this,

2344
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:35,520
then perhaps you'd want to
move the cold water exposure

2345
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,170
to a different day entirely,

2346
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:39,840
but it all depends on how
neurotically attached you are

2347
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,380
to getting every last bit
of strength and hypertrophy.

2348
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,090
And if that's your goal, terrific,

2349
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:47,770
well then probably moving
the cold exposure four hours

2350
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:49,080
or more away from that training

2351
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,740
is going to be necessary for you.

2352
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:53,730
Now you'll notice I did
not talk about cold showers

2353
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:55,880
and the reason I did not
talk about cold showers

2354
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,380
is that there simply are
not very many studies

2355
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:02,010
of deliberate cold exposure
through cold showers

2356
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,080
for the reasons I talked about

2357
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,130
at the beginning of the episode.

2358
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:08,400
It's hard for me to imagine
that taking a brief cold shower

2359
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,070
after a strength or
hypertrophy training session

2360
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,700
would completely reverse or
short circuit the effects

2361
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,510
of that strength and hypertrophy training.

2362
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:17,900
But again, if you're neurotically attached

2363
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:21,140
to getting every last bit
of strength and hypertrophy

2364
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:23,730
out of your training
sessions, then by all means,

2365
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:26,280
err on the side of caution
and wait four hours or more

2366
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,650
to do your cold shower just
as you would wait four hours

2367
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:31,620
or more to do your cold water immersion.

2368
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,950
Now there are nice data
pointing to the fact

2369
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:37,600
that doing cold water
immersion after a hard run,

2370
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,100
so endurance training,

2371
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:41,690
or even sprint and interval training

2372
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:45,690
or after a weight workout
where your main focus

2373
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,560
is on performance of those movements

2374
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,230
or after a skill training workout

2375
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:52,300
where your main focus on
performance of those movements,

2376
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,580
that there's no reason to think that that

2377
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:57,410
cold water immersion or
ice bath or cold shower

2378
01:39:57,410 --> 01:40:01,580
would inhibit the progress or the stimulus

2379
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,400
that would lead to progress

2380
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,290
that occurred during
that training session.

2381
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:07,490
In other words, I don't see any reason

2382
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:10,600
based on the literature to
avoid deliberate cold exposure

2383
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,080
immediately after training,

2384
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,920
again unless your goal is
hypertrophy and strength.

2385
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:16,753
And in fact,

2386
01:40:16,753 --> 01:40:19,220
there's a very nice
review recently published

2387
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,610
on deliberate cold exposure

2388
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:24,750
and how it can impact
physical performance,

2389
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:27,780
whether or not it's done before or after,

2390
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:30,300
different types of training and so forth.

2391
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:33,550
The paper is entitled impact
of cold water immersion

2392
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:35,310
compared with passive recovery,

2393
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:37,820
following a single about
of strenuous exercise

2394
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:41,320
on athletic performance in
physically active participants,

2395
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,120
a systematic review with
meta-analysis and meta regression.

2396
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:49,570
So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studies

2397
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:51,930
that looked at a tremendous
number of variables

2398
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:55,250
and contexts, as you would
expect in a meta-analysis

2399
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,850
of 52 studies.

2400
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,410
I'm going to read you the
conclusions of the study

2401
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,930
and I will provide a link.

2402
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:01,610
We certainly don't have
the time to go through

2403
01:41:01,610 --> 01:41:02,740
all the details of the study.

2404
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:05,150
I will highlight a few specific outcomes

2405
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:07,100
that I found particularly interesting,

2406
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,440
but here I am paraphrasing
their conclusions,

2407
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,130
that cold water immersion, I
want to emphasize immersion,

2408
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:18,120
not cold showers, but cold water immersion

2409
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,080
they say was an effective recovery tool

2410
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,340
after high intensity exercise.

2411
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:23,880
They observed positive outcomes,

2412
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,410
meaning improvements in certain variables,

2413
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:30,310
for muscular power, muscular soreness,

2414
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,610
meaning reduced muscular soreness,

2415
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:33,320
increased muscular power,

2416
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,760
perceived recovery after
24 hours of exercise.

2417
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,360
However, there were
certain forms of exercise

2418
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,370
that were not benefited
by cold water immersion,

2419
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:45,830
such as eccentric exercise,

2420
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:49,260
exercise focusing only
on the lowering component

2421
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:52,750
or the so-called eccentric
component of resistance exercise.

2422
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:56,670
They saw some very entry
dose response relationships

2423
01:41:56,670 --> 01:42:00,470
for things like endurance
training, meaning the longer

2424
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:02,840
the cold exposure post-endurance training,

2425
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:05,330
the more improvement in
endurance performance,

2426
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:08,790
reductions in circulating creatine kinases

2427
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,300
and things that relate to muscle damage

2428
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:12,400
under certain conditions.

2429
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,280
At some point in the future, by the way,

2430
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,230
we'll do an entire episode on
creatine and creatine kinase,

2431
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:19,740
which are important not
just for muscular function,

2432
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,620
but also for brain function.

2433
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:25,320
But the basic takeaway was
that cold water immersion

2434
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,750
performed after high intensity exercise

2435
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:30,760
was beneficial from a number
of different standpoints

2436
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:34,430
and indicated that shorter duration,

2437
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:37,210
cold exposure and lower temperatures

2438
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:40,580
can improve the efficacy
of cold water exposure

2439
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:42,970
if used after high intensity exercise.

2440
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:45,450
There I'm directly pulling
from their conclusions.

2441
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:47,920
So what this says is
that it's not just those

2442
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,460
longer duration, 30, 45
minute and 60 minute protocols

2443
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,910
of cold water immersion
that we discussed earlier,

2444
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:58,130
but also shorter duration
of one minute, three minute,

2445
01:42:58,130 --> 01:43:02,510
five minute exposures
to lower temperatures.

2446
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,790
Temperatures that would
make you psychologically

2447
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:07,730
want to get out as soon
as you possibly can,

2448
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:10,030
but again that you can safely stay in

2449
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:12,810
done after training
really have been shown to

2450
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:15,970
improve outcomes in terms
of reducing soreness

2451
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:18,750
and improving training efficacy,

2452
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:22,480
meaning your ability to get
back into training more quickly

2453
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,770
and thereby deliver more training stimuli

2454
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:29,110
to a given muscle or in your
endurance training protocol.

2455
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:29,943
Translate to English,

2456
01:43:29,943 --> 01:43:33,020
what this means is that taking
a cold shower or getting into

2457
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:35,810
an ice bath or some other
form of cold water immersion

2458
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:39,160
within the immediate minutes
or even the immediate hours

2459
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,960
following your training has
been shown to be beneficial.

2460
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,860
I'm sure a number of you
have questions for instance,

2461
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,070
how long should you be
in that cold exposure?

2462
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:52,750
Is it the same as the 11 minute
threshold described earlier?

2463
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:53,680
To be honest with you,

2464
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,340
there are not enough
studies to really point

2465
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:59,900
to the critical threshold for eliminating

2466
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,840
or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness

2467
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,400
or for getting maximal results from power

2468
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,600
and endurance training,

2469
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,340
but this study does make
a couple of key points

2470
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,220
and here I will just paraphrase.

2471
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,670
For instance, that cold water immersion

2472
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:16,900
is more likely to positively influence

2473
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,700
muscular power performance,

2474
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:22,730
to reduce muscle soreness, to
reduce serum creatine kinase,

2475
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,960
and to improve perceived recovery

2476
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,810
after high intensity exercise,

2477
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,290
as compared with passive recovery.

2478
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:33,040
This can be translated to cold
water exposure after training

2479
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,480
is beneficial and probably better

2480
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,670
than passive recovery from
a number of standpoints.

2481
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:41,970
In addition, they say that
dose response relationships

2482
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:47,160
meaning the amount and the degree of cold

2483
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,910
that people were exposed to
and how often they did that

2484
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:53,770
in particular in lower
temperature cold immersion.

2485
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:57,050
So these would be the sorts
of cold immersion protocols

2486
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:59,570
that are one minute or two
minutes, three minutes,

2487
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:00,860
maybe five minutes,

2488
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,830
but that one couldn't stay in there longer

2489
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:03,820
because it feels stressful

2490
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,610
and one wants to get out.

2491
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:08,280
Maybe more effective after
high intensity exercise

2492
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:11,410
for removal of serum creatine kinase

2493
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:13,460
as well that these shorter duration

2494
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:16,130
cold water immersion approaches
may be more effective

2495
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:19,860
after high intensity
endurance performance as well.

2496
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:22,920
So all of this can be
translated to say that

2497
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:27,200
unless your main goal is
hypertrophy and strength,

2498
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,877
that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion

2499
01:45:30,877 --> 01:45:32,590
and cold water ice bath,

2500
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:34,280
but if you don't have access to that,

2501
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,220
then cold showers is likely
going to be beneficial

2502
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,900
if done immediately
after or in the minutes

2503
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,500
or hours after your training,

2504
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,310
especially high intensity training.

2505
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:46,570
One particularly nice thing
about this meta-analysis

2506
01:45:46,570 --> 01:45:48,920
is that it included some studies that

2507
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,770
involve the use of cooling packs.

2508
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:55,430
So again, vests that can
essentially ice packs

2509
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:59,040
and indeed even cryotherapy
chambers and so on.

2510
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,370
There's a nice table in the study

2511
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:02,220
if you want to get really detailed and go

2512
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,810
and look specifically at those studies,

2513
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:04,850
I invite you to do that.

2514
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:07,260
We'll put a link to this
study in the caption

2515
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,320
for this episode, but all in all,

2516
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,990
what this study shows is
that deliberate cold exposure

2517
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:17,000
can be very useful for recovery
likely through reductions

2518
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,690
in inflammation, in muscle
and connective tissue.

2519
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:22,940
And while this study did
not look specifically

2520
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:24,990
at the mechanisms of reduced inflammation

2521
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,890
caused by deliberate cold exposure,

2522
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:30,520
those mechanisms are somewhat known.

2523
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,730
There are a number of studies
that have pointed to the fact

2524
01:46:32,730 --> 01:46:34,870
that deliberate cold and cold generally

2525
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:37,400
can reduce inflammatory cytokines,

2526
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,560
such as IL-6, interleukin six.

2527
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:43,160
It can increase
anti-inflammatory cytokines

2528
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,293
such as interleukin 10 and so on.

2529
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:48,040
Without getting into all those details,

2530
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:50,590
I think it's sufficient to say that

2531
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:52,180
if you are somebody who experiences

2532
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:54,300
a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness,

2533
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,060
taking a cold shower after your training

2534
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:58,370
or getting into a cold
immersion after your training,

2535
01:46:58,370 --> 01:47:01,060
even if it's a few hours
later ought to help.

2536
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:04,610
And if you are doing
particularly intense training,

2537
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:07,460
then you probably want
to ratchet up the number

2538
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:10,220
of cold exposure sessions
that you're doing

2539
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,420
even if those have to
be done on separate days

2540
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,253
from your training,

2541
01:47:13,253 --> 01:47:15,910
because a lot of the
inflammatory effects of training,

2542
01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:17,920
endurance and strength
training are actually occurring

2543
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,720
some hours away from
the training stimulus.

2544
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,380
So it's not just that inflammation goes up

2545
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,100
radically during training,
which it often can,

2546
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,260
but that it can occur even in the days

2547
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,480
and even weeks afterwards,

2548
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,440
depending how intense
and how long duration

2549
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,340
that training is.

2550
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,870
So deliberate cold
exposure is very powerful

2551
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:36,440
as an anti-inflammatory tool.

2552
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,600
Now I'd like to emphasize
the topic that we touched on

2553
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,430
at the beginning of the episode,

2554
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:43,140
which are those glabrous skin surfaces,

2555
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,420
the hands, the upper face,

2556
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:47,870
and the bottoms of the
feet through which heat

2557
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:50,460
is especially good at leaving the body.

2558
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:54,860
And another way of putting
that is that one can cool

2559
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,640
the body much more efficiently

2560
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,920
through the glabrous skin surfaces.

2561
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:01,530
Now, if you want to
understand all of the science

2562
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:05,900
behind this and all of
the various applications,

2563
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:07,840
I invite you to please
listen to the episode

2564
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,320
that I did with Dr. Craig Heller, again,

2565
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,253
in the biology department at Stanford.

2566
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:14,760
For sake of this episode,

2567
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,100
I'm just going to detail
a couple of findings

2568
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,410
from his laboratory.

2569
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:21,430
The first one, dealing with
exercise induced hyperthermia,

2570
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:22,840
because I think this is very interesting

2571
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,620
and it can even save lives

2572
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:26,470
if you understand the way this works.

2573
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,730
There's a particular paper
that focuses on this,

2574
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:32,350
and we will put a link to this as well.

2575
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:34,200
The title of this paper
is novel application

2576
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,590
of chemical cold packs for treatment

2577
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:37,640
of exercise induced hyperthermia,

2578
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,600
a randomized control trial.

2579
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,200
This is a pretty brutal study,

2580
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,393
brutal for the subjects that is.

2581
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:49,490
This study involved was having
subjects walk on a treadmill

2582
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:51,320
at a pretty significant
incline and anywhere

2583
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:56,300
from nine to 17% wearing a
substantial amount of clothing

2584
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,240
that was not well ventilated

2585
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,730
and the room was kept
to 40 degrees Celsius,

2586
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:03,240
which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

2587
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:06,730
This is definitely not
something to do at home.

2588
01:49:06,730 --> 01:49:09,210
This study was designed
to induce hyperthermia,

2589
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,650
which as I mentioned earlier,
can be quite dangerous.

2590
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:14,430
And they compared two types of cooling.

2591
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:16,240
In the first form of cooling

2592
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,240
that they call traditional cooling,

2593
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,540
they had ice packs on their neck,

2594
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,920
in their armpits and in their groin.

2595
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,550
And in the other group,

2596
01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:27,870
there was the so-called
glabrous skin cooling.

2597
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:29,620
So the palms, the soles of the feet,

2598
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:32,730
which were actually so they
were cooling inside the boots

2599
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:38,203
or inside of gloves and on
the upper portion of the face.

2600
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:41,270
And the basic takeaway of this study

2601
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:43,283
is that by cooling the glabrous skin,

2602
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:47,310
the subjects were able
to sustain this walking

2603
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:50,930
on these inclined
treadmills for much longer

2604
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:54,240
than were the people who
received traditional cooling.

2605
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,420
And also the return to
baseline temperature

2606
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:59,860
was much faster in the
glabrous skin cooling group.

2607
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:01,890
So how this translates to the real world

2608
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:04,070
is that if ever you are hyperthermic

2609
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:05,620
or someone else's hyperthermic,

2610
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:10,430
one way to cool them
down quickly is to cool

2611
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:14,550
these palmer glabrous,
soles of the feet glabrous

2612
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:18,060
and upper portion of the face
glabrous portions of the body

2613
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:22,360
using cool rags, using ice
packs or using any number

2614
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,543
of different cold objects or temperatures.

2615
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:30,150
One key thing, if you're going
to use glabrous skin cooling,

2616
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:33,190
is that whatever you use
to cool those surfaces

2617
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:36,093
cannot be so cold that it
causes vasoconstriction.

2618
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,970
Because as I mentioned earlier,

2619
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:41,700
the arterio-venous anastomoses

2620
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,970
these portals of arteries
directly to veins

2621
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:47,803
that exist only in these
glabrous skin surfaces,

2622
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:51,610
the way that they're able to cool the body

2623
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:53,950
and essentially pass cool into the body

2624
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,110
although that's not
really what they're doing,

2625
01:50:55,110 --> 01:50:57,450
they're actually extracting
heat from the body

2626
01:50:57,450 --> 01:51:00,570
to be technical, they're
extracting heat from the body,

2627
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:04,150
the only way they can do
that is if those veins

2628
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:06,780
don't collapse and veins will collapse

2629
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:08,830
if they are made very, very cold.

2630
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:11,580
So if you want to use
glabrous skin cooling

2631
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:12,890
to offset hyperthermia

2632
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,470
or for the other forms of performance,

2633
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:16,220
which we'll talk about in a moment,

2634
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:19,690
you need to use a cool object or surface

2635
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:22,270
that is not so cold that
it causes vasoconstriction.

2636
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:24,760
And this can be a little
bit tough to dial in,

2637
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:27,960
meaning it can be tough to
identify such an object.

2638
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:28,850
And for that reason,

2639
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:30,870
Dr. Heller and some of his
colleagues have developed

2640
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:32,540
a commercial product called the CoolMitt.

2641
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:34,590
You can actually go to
their website, coolmitt.com.

2642
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:37,830
I don't have any financial or
other relationship to them.

2643
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:39,560
I know they've been
developing this technology

2644
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:40,470
for some period of time.

2645
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:43,580
It involves a glove that
you put your hand into,

2646
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:47,800
it circulates water of a given
temperature and it does so,

2647
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:51,120
and does so at a tempera
or that is sure to not

2648
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:53,170
cause vasoconstriction of the palm.

2649
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:54,003
And you may be asking,

2650
01:51:54,003 --> 01:51:56,220
how can you just put
your hand into one glove

2651
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:57,053
and have this work?

2652
01:51:57,053 --> 01:51:59,770
Well, that's how powerful these
glabrous skin surfaces are.

2653
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:02,850
Even just by cooling one palm,

2654
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:06,330
the core body temperature drops radically.

2655
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:08,960
Now that's their commercial technology.

2656
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,950
I know that some people out
there have started to experiment

2657
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:13,100
with a home version of this,

2658
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:15,640
which would be taking
a package for instance

2659
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:18,950
of frozen blueberries
or some other cold drink

2660
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:21,810
or cold metal object, and
actually bringing it into the gym

2661
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:23,420
or out on a run.

2662
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:25,130
There are even people
who are now developing

2663
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:29,230
cooled psych bicycle
handles for long rides.

2664
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:31,320
This might seem a little
kooky or crazy to you,

2665
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,800
but as you'll soon hear in the study

2666
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:37,300
I'm about to describe,
the increases in endurance

2667
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,890
and in the volume of strength training

2668
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:43,300
that people can conduct
if they appropriately cool

2669
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:46,190
their body through these
glabrous skin portals

2670
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,410
is actually quite significant.

2671
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:50,530
So again, as it relates to hyperthermia,

2672
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,880
if someone is overheating by all means,

2673
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,250
try and get them out of that heat,

2674
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:57,650
get them to stop exercising,
you can die from hyperthermia,

2675
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:59,080
try and cool the bottoms of the feet,

2676
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:01,340
the palms of their hands

2677
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:03,240
and the upper portion of their face.

2678
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:06,480
That does not mean it would be a bad idea

2679
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:08,200
to put cold water on
the top of their head.

2680
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,690
That probably would also help
and perhaps on their neck.

2681
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:14,610
What is probably not going
to be a good idea is to do

2682
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:17,330
the more standard thing of
draping someone in cold towels

2683
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:19,220
on the surface of their
body because as I mentioned,

2684
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:20,510
the beginning of the episode,

2685
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,390
that thermostat in the hypothalamus,

2686
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:25,700
the medial preoptic area
will typically react to that

2687
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,270
by increasing core body
temperature further.

2688
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:31,590
The effects of glabrous skin
cooling on physical performance

2689
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:32,820
are truly remarkable

2690
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:36,400
provided the glabrous skin
cooling is done correctly.

2691
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:40,000
And I want to point out that
the main degree of effect

2692
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,220
is on volume or the
ability to do more work.

2693
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:47,690
And I want to point this out
because I think that many people,

2694
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:49,360
certainly in the exercise
science community,

2695
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,550
but even in the general public,

2696
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:52,460
when they hear about some of these effects

2697
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,640
that are measured in the laboratory,

2698
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:59,130
they sort of look at those
effects a bit of scans

2699
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:01,090
and they think, well, that's not possible.

2700
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:03,430
Effects for instance,
that have been documented

2701
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:05,900
showing doubling or tripling
of the number of dips

2702
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:08,810
that one can do in a
relatively short amount of time

2703
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:11,810
or doubling of the number
of pullups one can do

2704
01:54:11,810 --> 01:54:15,570
or 14% increases in strength
or even comparable degrees

2705
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:18,330
in increase in weight training output

2706
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:20,450
to people who are on
performance enhancing drugs,

2707
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:22,250
et cetera, et cetera.

2708
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:25,040
Part of the confusion is that the effects

2709
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,430
of proper palmer cooling,

2710
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:30,120
because it almost always
is done by palmer cooling

2711
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:32,460
and less often in these experiments

2712
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:33,787
by cooling of the bottoms of the feet

2713
01:54:33,787 --> 01:54:35,570
and the upper portion of the face,

2714
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:40,570
but those effects tend to be
the ability to do more work

2715
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:45,210
over time and just to illustrate
some of the major effects

2716
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:46,370
that the Heller lab is seen

2717
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:48,120
and they are document
entered in this manuscript

2718
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,970
that I'll share with you in a moment.

2719
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:53,370
The typical protocol is
to have people come in

2720
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:54,770
and do some endurance training

2721
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:57,710
so running on a treadmill
and to have a condition where

2722
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:01,020
one group is actually doing palmer cooling

2723
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:03,640
while they are on a bike or on a treadmill

2724
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:07,000
and inevitably the outcome is
that they can do more work.

2725
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,950
They can pedal further at a given speed,

2726
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:13,190
or they can run longer at
a given speed than people

2727
01:55:13,190 --> 01:55:14,810
who are not doing palmer cooling

2728
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:18,080
or who are receiving cooling by way of

2729
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,770
cold compress to the back
of the neck or ice pack

2730
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:22,820
to the armpits, et cetera.

2731
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:25,070
So the effects of palmer
cooling are very clear

2732
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:26,760
and very robust.

2733
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:29,590
And in the context of endurance exercise

2734
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:31,960
almost always allow
people to do more work,

2735
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:35,410
to go longer with less perceived
effort and to quit later

2736
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:36,243
so to speak.

2737
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,810
In terms of strength training,

2738
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:42,580
they've looked at the capacity
to perform sets of dips.

2739
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:44,810
So one of the more famous examples of this

2740
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:48,800
that Dr. Heller shares in the
episode that we did earlier,

2741
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,660
and that you can find at
hubermanlab.com involves

2742
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:55,940
someone coming in and doing
sets of dips, maybe 40 dips.

2743
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:58,360
This person actually could do
40 dips on their first set,

2744
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,660
then resting for a period
of two to three minutes

2745
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,470
and then doing 35

2746
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:04,530
and then resting for a period
of two or three minutes,

2747
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:06,870
and then doing progressively
fewer and fewer and fewer

2748
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:09,430
to the point where over a period of time,

2749
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:11,860
they add up the total number
of dips that they can do

2750
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:14,260
and then they have them come back

2751
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:16,960
after a period of recovery,
so not immediately after,

2752
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,710
but take a couple of days,

2753
01:56:18,710 --> 01:56:21,570
come back and do effectively
the same protocol,

2754
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:22,930
but during their rest periods,

2755
01:56:22,930 --> 01:56:25,920
they're doing two minutes
of palmer cooling,

2756
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,350
which essentially allows
heat to move out of the body,

2757
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:31,540
lowering core body
temperature in other words.

2758
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:35,350
And what they find is that
they see enormous increases

2759
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:37,340
in the total number of
dips that people can do,

2760
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:38,630
but that doesn't mean that the person goes

2761
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:39,910
from being able to do 40 dips,

2762
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:43,120
to being able to do 50 dips
or 60 dips on that first set,

2763
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:46,070
what it means is they are able
to do 40 on the first set,

2764
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:47,260
then 40 on the second,

2765
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:50,090
then 38 on the third
and so on and so forth

2766
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:52,930
so that the total duration
of the workout is extended

2767
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:55,530
and yet they're doing much more work,

2768
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:57,330
even though it takes more time.

2769
01:56:57,330 --> 01:56:59,167
So that's an important point

2770
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:02,840
and I think a point that
perhaps wasn't as clear

2771
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:05,420
or as clearly made by me
in the previous episodes

2772
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:07,460
that discuss this topic.

2773
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,750
For those of you that are interested

2774
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:11,450
in exploring palmer cooling, first of all,

2775
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:15,090
I recommend taking a brief
glance or even a deep dive

2776
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:17,090
into this study,

2777
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:18,600
which is entitled work volume

2778
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,240
and strength training
responses to resistive exercise

2779
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:24,323
improve with periodic heat
extraction from the palm.

2780
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:30,400
In this study, they describe
big increases in anaerobic,

2781
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:32,660
meaning strength training output,

2782
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:35,280
things like improvement in dips,

2783
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,000
improvement in bench press,

2784
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,840
improvement in pull-ups, et
cetera, in human subjects.

2785
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:43,070
And it's a really nice study and points

2786
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:44,890
to some of the protocols
that you might be able

2787
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,810
to adapt in your own setup.

2788
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,920
For instance, over six
weeks of pull up training,

2789
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:53,920
palm cooling in between sets
improved volume by 144%,

2790
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,520
and this was in experienced subjects.

2791
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,890
So that's interesting
because a lot of studies

2792
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:01,380
of strength training and
improvements in hypertrophy

2793
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,610
and strength are done in
inexperienced untrained athletes,

2794
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:07,370
which changes the picture somewhat

2795
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:10,680
compared to experienced athletes.

2796
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,980
They found that strength,

2797
01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:13,480
meaning the one repetition maximum,

2798
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:17,170
increased 22% over 10 weeks
in bench press training.

2799
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:20,050
And they point to the
particularly strong effects

2800
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:23,410
of using palmer cooling
when people reach plateaus

2801
01:58:23,410 --> 01:58:25,120
in endurance and strength training.

2802
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,680
And there, I think it's
an important point.

2803
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:30,300
I think that if you're going
to explore palmer cooling,

2804
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:32,600
it's probably not the sort of
thing that you're going to do

2805
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:36,050
in every run or in every about of cycling

2806
01:58:36,050 --> 01:58:38,640
or in every strength training session,

2807
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:42,520
but that it might be used to
vastly increase your volume

2808
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,590
or vastly increase your endurance

2809
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,700
in a given session or a set of sessions

2810
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:49,100
in order to push through plateaus.

2811
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:51,660
A particularly interesting
point in light of that

2812
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:54,710
is Dr. Heller has observed again and again

2813
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:57,650
that palmer cooling reduces
delayed onset muscle soreness,

2814
01:58:57,650 --> 01:58:59,490
or it can eliminate it entirely.

2815
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:02,070
And that's very interest because
it also points to the fact

2816
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:05,350
that reducing core body
temperature may somehow be involved

2817
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:06,200
in short circuiting

2818
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,660
the normal mechanisms of
delayed onset muscle soreness.

2819
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:10,540
And you might say, well,

2820
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:12,380
how would temperature be involved

2821
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:14,360
in delayed onset muscle soreness?

2822
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:17,610
Well, I want to refer you
back to the meta-analysis

2823
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:20,390
that we talked about earlier,
where the short duration,

2824
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:23,990
very cold temperature exposure
after training did indeed

2825
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:25,520
reduce delayed onset muscle soreness

2826
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,990
in part through reduction,
excuse me, in creatine kinase.

2827
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:32,310
So it's not inconceivable that temperature

2828
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:35,000
and delayed onset muscle
soreness are related.

2829
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,210
And that raises perhaps
the most important point,

2830
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:42,210
which is the way that palmer
cooling can improve performance

2831
01:59:42,570 --> 01:59:46,110
by way of reducing core
body temperature is known

2832
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:50,400
and that is because when
one engages in exercise

2833
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:52,120
or muscular output of any kind,

2834
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:54,930
strength or endurance exercise,

2835
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:58,410
the range of temperatures under
which a muscle can perform

2836
01:59:58,410 --> 02:00:00,610
is actually very narrow.

2837
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,800
There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase,

2838
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,640
which is critical to muscle contractions

2839
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:07,940
and pyruvate kinase can only function

2840
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:09,810
in a very narrow range of temperatures.

2841
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:11,550
If that temperature gets too hot,

2842
02:00:11,550 --> 02:00:13,930
meaning if the muscle heats up locally,

2843
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:14,763
whether or not by running

2844
02:00:14,763 --> 02:00:17,990
or cycling or swimming or weightlifting,

2845
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:19,870
the ability for that muscle to continue

2846
02:00:19,870 --> 02:00:22,160
to contract is reduced and eventually

2847
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:23,950
is short circuited completely.

2848
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:26,890
And I think this is a much underexplored

2849
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:29,420
or at least a much under discussed aspect

2850
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:32,290
of so-called muscular
failure or the failure

2851
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:35,310
of one to continue to endure in running.

2852
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:36,143
So for instance,

2853
02:00:36,143 --> 02:00:38,750
when you run as compared to
a bench press or something,

2854
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:39,950
you don't stop running

2855
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:42,470
because you can't actually
contract the muscles further,

2856
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:46,040
but somehow signals about the heating up

2857
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:48,740
of muscular tissue are
conveyed to the brain.

2858
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:49,760
There's a crosstalk there,

2859
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:53,370
it's probably bidirectional
and people stop, they quit.

2860
02:00:53,370 --> 02:00:54,863
This is the quitting reflex.

2861
02:00:56,100 --> 02:01:00,210
In strength training, one can
no longer perform a repetition

2862
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:01,760
or set of repetitions in part

2863
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,500
because of heating up
of the muscle locally.

2864
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,580
There are other mechanisms
as well, of course,

2865
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,030
and I realize that,

2866
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:10,390
but what's very clear from the
palmer cooling work is that

2867
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:13,260
by simply holding onto a cool object,

2868
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:14,910
remember not an object so cold

2869
02:01:14,910 --> 02:01:17,140
that it constricts the
vessels of the palms

2870
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:20,070
or constricts the vessels
on the bottoms of the feet,

2871
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:22,800
but by holding onto a
relatively cool object

2872
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,120
in one or both hands in between
sets for two minutes or so,

2873
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:29,810
you can very efficiently reduce
your core body temperature

2874
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:32,920
and in doing so, reduce the
temperature of the muscles

2875
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,120
that are doing the work,

2876
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:37,910
increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase

2877
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:40,800
to continue to allow
your muscles to contract

2878
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,010
and thereby allow you to
do more volume of endurance

2879
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:45,050
and strength training.

2880
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:48,240
So a simple protocol that
Dr. Heller passed to me

2881
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:51,610
is find a relatively cool object.

2882
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:52,670
So you could, for instance,

2883
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:54,410
fill two bottles with cold water,

2884
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:56,460
maybe put a few ice cubes in there.

2885
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:58,620
This is not exact because
we're not talking about

2886
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:00,060
the commercial CoolMitt product here,

2887
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,820
we're talking about an at home version

2888
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:05,310
or use a pack of frozen
blueberries or broccoli

2889
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:07,830
sort of pack of those
as what he described.

2890
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:10,420
And then in between sets to put your hands

2891
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:12,120
and ideally you'd put
the bottoms of your feet,

2892
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:13,920
but that's not always
feasible in most gyms

2893
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,220
where they won't let you take
off your shoes and so forth,

2894
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:19,160
but to put the palms of your
hands on that cool surface

2895
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:22,570
for a minute or two minutes between sets

2896
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:24,930
and then returning to your sets of work.

2897
02:02:24,930 --> 02:02:28,710
Now, if you are heating up
through other mechanisms

2898
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:30,020
like you're wearing a stocking cap

2899
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:31,540
and you're in a very warm environment,

2900
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:33,420
this might not have as potent effect

2901
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:35,110
as if you were to do this cooling

2902
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:36,770
in a more moderate environment,

2903
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:38,700
wearing lighter clothing, et cetera.

2904
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:41,510
So by all means warm
up to do your exercise,

2905
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:42,490
lubricate your joints,

2906
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:44,380
and get into a place where you're
not going to injure yourself,

2907
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:46,450
doing whatever form of exercise you do.

2908
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:48,950
But then if you'd like to
explore palmer cooling,

2909
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:51,160
I know a number of people
who've written to me saying

2910
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,260
they heard about palmer cooling

2911
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,500
on the episode with Dr. Heller.

2912
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,660
They've tried this and they
see quite excellent results.

2913
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,250
It does take some discipline.

2914
02:02:58,250 --> 02:02:59,990
It's one thing to just
kind of hang out in the gym

2915
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:01,280
and play on your phone in between sets.

2916
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,140
It's another to do deliberate
cooling with your palms

2917
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:04,973
or the bottom of your feet

2918
02:03:04,973 --> 02:03:06,237
or the upper portion of your face.

2919
02:03:06,237 --> 02:03:07,920
You might get some weird looks,

2920
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,110
but of course you'll be the one

2921
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:11,090
doing significantly more volume,

2922
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:14,560
not experiencing delayed onset
muscle soreness and achieving

2923
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,040
better endurance and strength gains

2924
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:17,540
were you to do this properly.

2925
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:19,960
Now as a final topic related to the use

2926
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,650
of deliberate cold exposure
for improving health

2927
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:26,210
and performance, I'd like
to touch on this theme

2928
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:28,330
that exists online, on social media,

2929
02:03:28,330 --> 02:03:31,800
on YouTube and in various
fitness communities

2930
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:34,340
of using deliberate cold
exposure to the groin,

2931
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,360
in particular to the testicles,

2932
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:39,310
in order to try and increase testosterone.

2933
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:41,663
And while this might sound really kooky,

2934
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,400
indeed this practice exists.

2935
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:47,150
Indeed if you were to go onto Amazon,

2936
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:50,718
there are actually ice pack underwear

2937
02:03:50,718 --> 02:03:54,840
that are being marketed for
sake of increasing testosterone.

2938
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:57,840
Now, I am not aware of any
specific well-controlled studies

2939
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:00,420
that show that this indeed works.

2940
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:03,740
I can imagine based on what I
know about the nervous system,

2941
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:06,050
testosterone and cold, et cetera,

2942
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:07,380
that there are a couple of mechanisms

2943
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:11,040
by which one might experience
increases in testosterone

2944
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,160
as a consequence of
deliberate cold exposure.

2945
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:15,150
First off, let me say
there is no reason why

2946
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:18,000
you would have to apply these ice packs

2947
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,410
in the way that I just described.

2948
02:04:20,410 --> 02:04:22,250
One could of course take a cold shower.

2949
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:26,320
One could of course use cold
immersion of various kinds,

2950
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,700
and you're still going
to get that exposure

2951
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:31,430
of the groin and the testicles to cold.

2952
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:34,720
Now I should point out
that people do report

2953
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:38,490
at least anecdotally
increases in testosterone

2954
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:40,040
as a consequence of this practice

2955
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,220
and I have to imagine

2956
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:43,080
that they are measuring
their serum testosterone,

2957
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:44,080
that they're not just guessing

2958
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:46,460
that their testosterone went up.

2959
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:48,530
If you know of a study
exploring this directly,

2960
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:51,550
please let me know, put in the
comment section on YouTube,

2961
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:53,200
or even just email me.

2962
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:57,420
We have a email that you can
find it, hubermanlab.com.

2963
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:58,910
Please email me the reference.

2964
02:04:58,910 --> 02:05:00,630
I wasn't able to find a reference,

2965
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:04,260
but I can imagine two
reasonably plausible mechanisms

2966
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:07,570
by which deliberate cold
exposure to the groin,

2967
02:05:07,570 --> 02:05:10,770
in particular the testicles,
would increase testosterone.

2968
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:13,280
The first is somewhat direct,

2969
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:17,110
which is that anytime
you cool a body surface,

2970
02:05:17,110 --> 02:05:18,530
that if it's cold enough,

2971
02:05:18,530 --> 02:05:20,320
you're going to get vasoconstriction.

2972
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,960
And then subsequently you're going to get

2973
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,730
a rebound increase in vasodilation,

2974
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:26,020
meaning you're going to constrict

2975
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:27,450
the blood vessels in that area.

2976
02:05:27,450 --> 02:05:29,560
And then after the cold is removed,

2977
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:31,939
there's going to be more
blood flow to that area.

2978
02:05:31,939 --> 02:05:32,938
And of course,

2979
02:05:32,938 --> 02:05:34,500
blood flow relates to organ health

2980
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:35,840
and tissue health generally.

2981
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:40,840
So perfusion of that region
and the gonads to be specific

2982
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:42,910
with additional blood,

2983
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:46,240
you could imagine in some
ways increasing testosterone,

2984
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,340
that's reasonably plausible.

2985
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,060
The other probably more likely mechanism

2986
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:54,940
relates to the dopamine
increases caused by cold exposure

2987
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,340
that we talked about earlier.

2988
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:59,690
Again, anytime you have a
somewhat stressful stimulus,

2989
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:01,480
but in particular with cold exposure,

2990
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:03,300
it seems that the catecholamines,

2991
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:07,360
norepinephrine, epinephrine
and dopamine all increase

2992
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,840
and dopamine is known to be in the pathway

2993
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,100
that can stimulate testosterone.

2994
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:15,130
And so while there isn't
a direct relationship

2995
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:17,300
between dopamine stimulating testosterone,

2996
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:19,080
there is an interesting
pathway way whereby

2997
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,330
dopamine increases can trigger increases

2998
02:06:21,330 --> 02:06:23,350
in things like luteinizing hormone,

2999
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:26,100
which can trigger
increases in testosterone

3000
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:28,190
as well as estrogen for that matter.

3001
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:30,220
So I know that there are
a lot of people out there

3002
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:32,010
that are interested in
the use of cold exposure

3003
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:33,400
for increasing testosterone.

3004
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:36,390
And some of those people
in communities are

3005
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:40,280
indeed using cold exposure
directly on the gonads,

3006
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:42,460
on the testees in order to do this.

3007
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:46,400
I'm not certain that that
direct contact is necessary.

3008
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:51,070
And in some cases it might
actually be quite dangerous

3009
02:06:51,070 --> 02:06:54,120
or you at least should be
careful in terms of tissues there

3010
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,810
and avoiding damage.

3011
02:06:55,810 --> 02:06:59,920
But nonetheless, I think
that a dopamine impact

3012
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:04,070
on testosterone is very likely
given the 250% increases

3013
02:07:04,070 --> 02:07:05,340
in dopamine that have been observed

3014
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:07,680
with cold water immersion and
all of that points to the fact

3015
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:09,610
that cold water immersion

3016
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:13,360
very likely increases testosterone,

3017
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,300
but as a downstream consequence

3018
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:18,180
of the cold water immersion
effects on dopamine

3019
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,550
and luteinizing hormone,

3020
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:22,260
and again there's no reason
to think that the increases

3021
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:25,290
in luteinizing hormone would
also increase estrogen.

3022
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:29,350
Probably not to dangerous or levels

3023
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:31,600
that one would want to avoid,

3024
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:33,190
but I don't think that there's anything

3025
02:07:33,190 --> 02:07:35,680
particularly specific about cold

3026
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,180
for inducing testosterone
and not other hormones.

3027
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:39,560
I think it's very likely to increases

3028
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:41,570
a number of different hormones.

3029
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:44,320
I do hope that there will be
a systematic study on this

3030
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,850
in the not too distant future.

3031
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:47,760
I also hope to not be a subject

3032
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,400
in the cooling of the gonads experiment.

3033
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,590
Now I promise you the last
topic was the last topic,

3034
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:54,620
but there's one other
really important point

3035
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:56,440
that I think everyone should be aware of

3036
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:59,070
if you're going to use
deliberate cold exposure.

3037
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:01,970
And that brings us back
to the very first thing

3038
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:03,510
that we discussed today,

3039
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:05,210
along the lines of
deliberate cold exposure,

3040
02:08:05,210 --> 02:08:07,200
which is that your baseline temperature

3041
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,490
is going to be lowest about
two hours before you wake up,

3042
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:13,760
it's going to increase in the morning

3043
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:15,070
and as you wake up

3044
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:17,280
and increase throughout
the day and afternoon,

3045
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,390
and then start to drop in the
evening and come down at night

3046
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:21,453
as you head to sleep.

3047
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:26,520
I also want you to remember
that if you are to cool

3048
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,370
the external portion of your
body, in particular your torso,

3049
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:33,830
the net effect of that is
going to be an increase

3050
02:08:33,830 --> 02:08:35,510
in body temperature.

3051
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:38,940
So for many people, not
all, but for many people,

3052
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:42,010
if you are going to do
deliberate cold exposure,

3053
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:45,220
you are going to increase
your core body temperature

3054
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,053
and that makes sense

3055
02:08:46,053 --> 02:08:48,640
if you think about how
deliberate cold exposure

3056
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:52,440
can increase metabolism by
increasing thermogenesis.

3057
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:56,120
What that all means is
that if you are doing

3058
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:58,740
your deliberate cold
exposure early in the day,

3059
02:08:58,740 --> 02:09:01,530
you are going to get
yet a further increase

3060
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:03,080
in core body temperature

3061
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:05,660
that would be associated with wakefulness,

3062
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:07,490
your ability to be alert that morning

3063
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:10,320
or throughout the day and so on.

3064
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:13,920
It also means that if you do
your deliberate cold exposure

3065
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,330
very late in the evening, or at night,

3066
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:21,330
so 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM and so on,

3067
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:23,787
you are going to increase
your core body temperature

3068
02:09:23,787 --> 02:09:25,830
and if you recall,

3069
02:09:25,830 --> 02:09:27,640
a decrease in core body temperature

3070
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:31,350
of one to three degrees
is not just beneficial,

3071
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:34,380
but is necessary in order
to get into deep sleep

3072
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:36,410
and remain in deep sleep.

3073
02:09:36,410 --> 02:09:39,730
So the takeaway from this
is deliberate cold exposure

3074
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:42,280
done properly will increase
your core body temperature

3075
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:44,270
and make you feel more alert.

3076
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:46,230
So if you're doing it early in the day,

3077
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:48,210
that's probably terrific

3078
02:09:48,210 --> 02:09:50,990
given that most of us want
to be alert during the day.

3079
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:54,560
However, if you do it too late
in the day, evening or night,

3080
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:57,040
it can disrupt sleep by way of disrupting

3081
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,820
your core body temperature.

3082
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:02,360
Now, the caveat to that is I myself

3083
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:05,190
tend to do deliberate cold
exposure early in the day.

3084
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:07,600
Maybe not first thing in the
morning, but mid morning,

3085
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:09,630
maybe as late as three
or four in the afternoon

3086
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:10,463
in some cases.

3087
02:10:10,463 --> 02:10:12,800
In the longer days of summer,
I might do it even later,

3088
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,650
five or 6:00 PM and have
no trouble sleeping.

3089
02:10:15,650 --> 02:10:18,970
I have done deliberate cold
exposure very late at night,

3090
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:21,780
10:00 PM, 11:00 PM and so on

3091
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:23,230
as part of a 30 day challenge

3092
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:25,990
of doing deliberate cold
exposure every day for 30 days

3093
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:27,570
and I got sloppy with my timing

3094
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:29,340
and then in order to not miss a day,

3095
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,010
I would do it at 11 o'clock at night.

3096
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:31,910
And I must say

3097
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:35,370
I found that I could still
fall asleep very easily,

3098
02:10:35,370 --> 02:10:38,100
even doing deliberate cold
exposure very late at night.

3099
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:42,320
However, on those particular
days, I was particularly busy

3100
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:45,610
and so I was particularly
exhausted when I arrived

3101
02:10:45,610 --> 02:10:46,900
at the deliberate cold exposure

3102
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:49,140
and I had no trouble falling asleep

3103
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:50,600
after doing deliberate cold exposure,

3104
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,050
and then taking a nice warm
shower and then going to sleep.

3105
02:10:53,050 --> 02:10:56,060
But I could imagine that
because of the increases

3106
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:59,380
in core body temperature caused
by deliberate cold exposure,

3107
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:02,100
that were one to do that
too late in the day,

3108
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:04,910
evening or night that it could
indeed disrupt your sleep.

3109
02:11:04,910 --> 02:11:06,240
So my recommendation would be

3110
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:09,250
for most people only do
deliberate cold exposure

3111
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:12,750
if you are prepared to be
fairly alert for the next one

3112
02:11:12,750 --> 02:11:14,910
to four or maybe had been six hours

3113
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:17,040
following that deliberate cold exposure.

3114
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,240
So for today's episode,

3115
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:20,180
as is the case with most episodes

3116
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:23,220
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
I covered a lot of material.

3117
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:25,990
We talked about mechanisms
of catecholamines and stress

3118
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:29,480
and pulsatile release of
epinephrine, metabolism,

3119
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:31,947
mental effects, performance,
glabrous skin cooling

3120
02:11:31,947 --> 02:11:33,920
and on and on and on.

3121
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:37,030
And while the goal of course
is to make sure that everyone

3122
02:11:37,030 --> 02:11:38,540
arrives at specific,

3123
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:41,800
very clear mechanistic
and actionable protocols,

3124
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,820
I do realize that it is an
immense amount of information.

3125
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:45,680
And for that reason,

3126
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:49,970
I've created a list of deliberate
cold exposure protocols

3127
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:53,700
aimed at improving mental
toughness and resilience,

3128
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:58,100
mood, performance, metabolism,
reducing inflammation,

3129
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:59,490
and so on and so forth.

3130
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:02,740
All of those have been
condensed into succinct form

3131
02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:05,210
and can be found at the Huberman Lab

3132
02:12:05,210 --> 02:12:06,920
Neural Network Newsletter.

3133
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:09,420
This is a monthly or
semi-monthly newsletter

3134
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:10,253
that we release

3135
02:12:10,253 --> 02:12:13,700
that includes takeaways from
the podcast and protocols.

3136
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:16,520
You can access those
as protocols zero cost

3137
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:19,110
by simply going to hubermanlab.com,

3138
02:12:19,110 --> 02:12:20,930
signing up for the neural
network newsletter.

3139
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:23,230
It's very easy to do, you
just supply your email

3140
02:12:23,230 --> 02:12:24,970
and you will receive the newsletter.

3141
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:27,830
We do not share your
email with anybody else.

3142
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:30,780
In fact, we have our
privacy policy laid out

3143
02:12:30,780 --> 02:12:32,950
on the hubermanlab.com website

3144
02:12:32,950 --> 02:12:35,870
so you can find that
there and the protocols

3145
02:12:35,870 --> 02:12:38,120
that I've designed should
make it very straightforward

3146
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:41,330
for you to create a set of protocols

3147
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:43,620
that you could use with cold
showers, with cold immersion,

3148
02:12:43,620 --> 02:12:46,360
with or without ice in
combination with exercise

3149
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:47,960
specifically for one goal or another,

3150
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:50,620
or to accomplish multiple
goals simultaneously.

3151
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:52,820

3171
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:36,390
On many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3172
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:37,860
we talk about supplements.

3173
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,970
While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,

3174
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:42,210
many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,

3175
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:43,980
for things like sleep and focus

3176
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:46,520
and other aspects of
health and performance.

3177
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:48,010
One issue with the supplement industry

3178
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:49,630
that's very serious, however,

3179
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:52,020
is that these supplement companies simply

3180
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:53,850
do not use high quality ingredients

3181
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:57,220
or the amounts of the ingredients
they list on the packaging

3182
02:13:57,220 --> 02:13:59,830
does not match what's actually
contained in their product.

3183
02:13:59,830 --> 02:14:00,663
For that reason,

3184
02:14:00,663 --> 02:14:03,570
we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

3185
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:04,780
because Thorne supplements

3186
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:07,350
are known to be of the very
highest quality ingredients

3187
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:10,970
and the very highest degree
of specificity in terms of

3188
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:12,190
the amounts of the ingredients

3189
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:13,750
that are listed on the packaging

3190
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:16,670
accurately match what's
contained in their products.

3191
02:14:16,670 --> 02:14:18,590
If you'd like to see the
Thorne products that I take,

3192
02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:23,590
you can go to Thorne, that's
thorne.com/u/huberman.

3193
02:14:24,107 --> 02:14:25,720
And there, you can see the Thorne products

3194
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:28,620
that I take and get 20%
off any of those products.

3195
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:31,080
In addition, if you navigate
deeper into the Thorne site,

3196
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:36,080
through that portal, Thorne,
thorne.com/u/huberman,

3197
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:37,790
you can also get 20% off

3198
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:40,070
any of the other products
that Thorne makes.

3199
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:42,190
If you're not already
subscribed to Huberman Lab

3200
02:14:42,190 --> 02:14:44,470
on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

3201
02:14:44,470 --> 02:14:46,920
There I cover science
and science related tools

3202
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:49,640
that sometimes overlap with
the content of the podcast,

3203
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:51,940
but oftentimes is distinct
from the information

3204
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:53,610
covered on this podcast.

3205
02:14:53,610 --> 02:14:54,690
So thank you once again

3206
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:57,180
for joining me in the
discussion about the use

3207
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:59,970
of deliberate cold exposure
for health and performance

3208
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:02,250
and last but certainly not least,

3209
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:04,200
thank you for your interest in science.
