00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,410
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,427
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:07,059
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,430
[instrumental music]

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,470
- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a professor of neurobiology

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,880
and ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,680
This podcast is separate from my teaching

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,480
and research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,570
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,570
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,710
and science related tools
to the general public.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,920
In keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,100
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,753
Our first sponsor is
Belcampo Meat Company.

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,020
Belcampo Meat Company
is a regenerative farm

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,180
in Northern California that
raises organic grass fed

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,540
and grass-finished certified humane meats.

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,390
I eat meat about once a day.

19
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,790
I'm neither pure carnivore,
nor am I a vegetarian.

20
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,090
Obviously I eat meat.

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,050
The way I eat is I tend
to fast until about noon

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,420
and then I have my first meal

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,060
which generally consists
of a piece of beef.

24
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,610
It's either ground beef or a steak.

25
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,440
I like ribeyes, I like flat
irons, these kinds of things

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,980
and a small salad,
sometimes a large salad.

27
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,780
And then throughout the
day, I generally am low carb

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,190
until the evening when
I eat pasta and rice

29
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,050
and things of that sort.

30
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,870
Eating that way is what
optimizes my levels of alertness

31
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,710
and optimizes my sleep.

32
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,660
I've talked about this on
previous podcast episodes,

33
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,280
Now, because I eat meat
essentially every day,

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,530
the source of that meat is
extremely important to me.

35
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,930
I want it to be healthy for me

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,500
and I want the animals that it comes from

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,020
to be healthy and to
have lived a good life.

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,530
Conventionally raised animals
are confined to feedlots

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,870
and they eat a diet of
inflammatory grains,

40
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,100
which is terrible for them
and it's terrible for us

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,640
when we eat those meats.

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,090
and seasonal grasses,
which results in meat

44
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,200
that is higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,980
They actually have very
high levels of Omega threes

46
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,810
which I've also talked
about on this podcast,

47
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,820
are important for mental
and physical health

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,710
for a variety of reasons.

49
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,390
The way Belcampo raises its animals

50
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,950
is also good for the environment.

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,790
They practice regenerative agriculture,

52
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,960
which means it's climate
positive and carbon negative

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,860
which translates to good for
us and good for the planet.

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,110
You can order Belcampo
sustainably raised meats

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,380
to be delivered straight to your door

56
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,010

58
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,100
That's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off.

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,780
Today's podcast is also
brought to us by InsideTracker.

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,290
InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform

61
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,890
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

62
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,620
to help you better understand your body

63
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,720
and reach your health goals.

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,650
I've long been a believer
in getting blood work done

65
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,600
for the simple reason that many,

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,930
if not most of the factors that impact

67
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,750
our immediate and longterm health

68
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,130
can only be assessed from a blood test.

69
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,930
And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,

70
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,480
we can get additional information

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,770
about our current health status
and our health trajectory.

72
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,600
One of major problems with
blood tests and DNA tests

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,940
available for most sources is
that you get the numbers back

74
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
and you can easily see
whether or not those numbers

75
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,550
are within the standard
range or outside the range.

76
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,330
But it's very hard to know what
to do with that information.

77
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,730
Also what the various factors are

78
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,240
that are being measured
is often very cryptic.

79
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,160
With InsideTracker,
they clarify everything.

80
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,200
They make it very clear and simple

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,130
as to what each of those
factors relates to,

82
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,560
so they give you some
understanding of what those are

83
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,700
and they give you ideas and suggestions

84
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,330
about things that you can
do with your lifestyle,

85
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,360
changes to your diet, changes
to your supplementation,

86
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,800
changes to your sleep
schedule or exercise patterns

87
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,310
that can serve to optimize the levels

88
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,510
of those various factors and your DNA.

89
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,440
In addition, they have something
called the inner age test

90
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,070
which compares your chronological age

91
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,600
which you already know
with your biological age

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,700
which gives you a sense of your lifespan

93
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,150
or predicted lifespan.

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,650
So that's crucially
important, and you can imagine

95
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,830
why many people, including me
would want that information.

96
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,440
If you'd like to try InsideTracker

103
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,400
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

105
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,100
probiotic drink.

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,410
I've been using Athletic Greens
for well over a decade now.

107
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,760
I started using Athletic
Greens and I still use

108
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,480
Athletic Greens because
I find it rather dizzying

109
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,960
to know which vitamins
and minerals to take.

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,020
And with Athletic Greens,
I cover all my bases

111
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,370
of vitamins and minerals.

112
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,550
In addition, it has
probiotics and we now know

113
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,450
from an enormous number of
quality peer reviewed studies

114
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,800
that the gut microbiome
is critically important

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,240
for our immune system function,
for the gut brain access

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,970
and for our mental functions

117
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,620
and probiotics are one way
to support the gut brain axis

118
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,840
and the gut health generally.

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,750
With Athletic Greens, I
basically just add water,

120
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,110
put in a little bit of lemon juice

121
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,440
'cause that's the way I like it.

122
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
Mix it up, it tastes delicious.

123
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,540
I'll do that once or twice a day.

124
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,660
It's compatible with
fasting at least for me,

125
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,410
it doesn't take me out of a fasting mode

126
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,800
which I do early in the day.

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,760
So most often I'll have my
Athletic Greens early in the day.

128
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,150
And then sometimes I'll
also have another one

129
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,630
late in the evening, or
sometimes even before bed.

130
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,790
I'm able to sleep after
drinking it without a problem.

131
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,710
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens

132
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,620
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

133
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,310
And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.

134
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,230
They'll give you five free travel packs,

135
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,710
which are these little
packs that make it very easy

136
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,750
to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road

137
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,185
or in the car or on a plane.

138
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:46,150
It makes all of that very simple.

139
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,310
And in addition, they will
give you a year supply

140
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,180
of vitamin D3 K2.

141
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,493
There are also a lot of
data supporting the fact

142
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:54,840
that vitamin D3 is critical

143
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,440
for a variety of health metrics.

144
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,700
We all know that we can get vitamin D3

145
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,350
from the sun, but many people including me

146
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,590
were not getting enough sunlight or D3

147
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,070
even if I was getting a lot of sunlight.

148
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,170
I know that 'cause I had my
blood levels measured of D3.

149
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,180
So I use vitamin D3 every day

150
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,020
in addition to the other things I take,

151
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,200
including Athletic Greens.

152
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,150
If you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,

153
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,630
you'll get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs

154
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,340
and a year supply of
the vitamin D3 and K2,

155
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,550
That's athleticgreens.com/huberman

156
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,740
to claim the special offer.

157
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,670
This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

158
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,560
we're talking all about
physical performance.

159
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,400
So that means athletic
performance, recreational exercise,

160
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,170
weightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,

161
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,370
skills and skill learning.

162
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,590
Today, we're going to talk about and focus

163
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,230
on skill learning.

164
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,730
We are going to focus on how
to learn skills more quickly

165
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,630
in particular motor skills.

166
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,770
This will also translate to things

167
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,560
like musical skills and
playing instruments,

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,130
but we're mainly going to
focus on physical movements

169
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,370
of the body that extend beyond the hands

170
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,360
like just playing the piano or the fingers

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
like playing the guitar.

172
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,550
But everything we're going to talk about

173
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,280
will also serve the formation
and the consolidation

174
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,780
and the performance of
other types of skills.

175
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,220
So if you're interested
in how to perform better,

176
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,180
whether or not it's dance or yoga

177
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,150
or even something that's
just very repetitive

178
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,900
like running or swimming, this
podcast episode is for you.

179
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,510
We're going to go deep into
the science of skill learning.

180
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,140
And we are going to talk
about very specific protocols

181
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,290
that the science points
to and has verified,

182
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,120
allow you to learn more
quickly to embed that learning

183
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,290
so that you remember it and
to be able to build up skills

184
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,250
more quickly than you would otherwise.

185
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,140
We are also going to touch on a few things

186
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,710
that I get asked about a
lot, but fortunately recently

187
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,850
I've had the time to go
deep into the literature,

188
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,770
extract the data for you and
that's mental visualization.

189
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,790
How does visualizing a
particular skill or practice

190
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,820
serve the learning and
or the consolidation

191
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,980
of that practice.

192
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,410
It turns out there are some
absolutely striking protocols

193
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,000
that one can use, striking
meaning they allow you

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,180
to learn faster and they
allow you to remember

195
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,360
how to do things more quickly and better

196
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,370
than if you were not doing
this mental rehearsal.

197
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,610
But the pattern of mental rehearsal

198
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,680
and when you do that mental rehearsal

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,940
turns out to be vitally important.

200
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,200
So I'm excited for today's episode.

201
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,940
We're going to share a lot
of information with you

202
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,260
and they're going to be a
lot of very simple takeaways.

203
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,110
So let's get started.

204
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,570
Before we get into the
topic of skill learning

205
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,059
and tools for accelerating skill learning,

206
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,640
I want to briefly revisit
the topic of temperature

207
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,263
which was covered in the last episode

208
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:49,670
and just highlight a
few things and clear up

209
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,210
some misunderstandings.

210
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,290
So last episode talked
about these incredible data

211
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,350
from my colleague, Craig
Heller's lab at Stanford.

212
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,000
He's in the department of biology,

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,070
showing that cooling the
palms in particular ways

214
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,130
and at particular times can allow athletes

215
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,200
or just recreational
exercisers to do more pull-ups,

216
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,700
dips, bench presses per
unit time, to run further,

217
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,960
to cycle further and to
feel better doing it.

218
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,360
There really are incredible
data that are anchored

219
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,360
in the biology of the vascular
system, the blood supply

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,050
and how it's involved in cooling us.

221
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,257
Many of you, dozens of you in fact said,

222
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:33,557
"Wait a second, you gave us
a protocol in this episode

223
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:36,837
"which says that we should
cool our palms periodically

224
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,883
"throughout exercise in order
to be able to do more work.

225
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,277
"But on the episode, before
that on growth hormone

226
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:48,347
"and thyroid hormone, you
said that heating up the body

227
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:51,130
"is good for release of growth hormone."

228
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,840
And I just want to clarify
that both things are true.

229
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,470
These are two separate protocols.

230
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,650
You should always warm
up before you exercise.

231
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,120
That warmup will not increase
your body temperature

232
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,870
or the muscle temperature to the point

233
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,560
where it's going to
diminish your work capacity,

234
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,460
that it's going to harm your performance.

235
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,330
The cooling of the palms,
which is really just a route

236
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,540
to cool your core in an efficient way,

237
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,630
the most efficient way, in fact

238
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,600
is about improving performance.

239
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,870
Heating up the body with exercise

240
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,680
and focusing on heat
increases or using sauna

241
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,170
for heat increases is geared
toward growth hormone release,

242
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,740
which is a separate matter.

243
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,780
So you can do both of these protocols

244
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,440
but you would want to do
them at separate times.

245
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,310
So just to make this very concrete

246
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,090
before I move on to today's topic.

247
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,880
If you're interested in doing more work,

248
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,370
being able to do more sets
and reps per unit time

249
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,950
and feel better doing it or to run further

250
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,230
or to cycle further, then
cooling the palms periodically

251
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,370
as I described in the previous episode

252
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,800
is going to be the way to go.

253
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,460
If you're interested in
getting growth hormone release,

254
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,280
well then hot sauna.

255
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,930
And I offered some other tools
if you don't have a sauna

256
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,740
in the episode on growth
hormone and thyroid hormone

257
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,490
is going to be the way to go.

258
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,010
So those are separate protocols.

259
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,610
You can include them
in your fitness regime

260
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,960
and your training regime,
but you do want to do them

261
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,640
at separate times.

262
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,890
And as a last point about this,

263
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,030
I also mentioned that
caffeine can either help

264
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,110
or hinder performance
depending on whether or not

265
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,450
you're caffeine adapted
because of the ways

266
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,890
that caffeine impacts body temperature

267
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,600
and all sorts of things like
vasodilation and constriction.

268
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
It's very simple.

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,810
If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts

270
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,360
and you're accustomed to
caffeine, meaning you drink it

271
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,810
three or five times or more a week.

272
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,050
100 to 300 milligrams this
is a typical daily dose

273
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,657
of caffeine.

274
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:45,620
Some of you are ingesting more, some less.

275
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,080
If you do that regularly,

276
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,860
well, then it's going to be
just fine to ingest caffeine

277
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,693
before you train.

278
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:53,026
It's not going to impact
your body temperature

279
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,910
and your vasodilation or constriction

280
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,930
in ways that will hinder you.

281
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,570
However, if you're not
a regular caffeine user

282
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,847
and you're thinking, "Oh, I'm
going to drink a cup of coffee

283
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,440
"and get this huge
performance enhancing effect."

284
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
Well, that's not going to happen.

285
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,840
Chances are it's going
to lead to increases

286
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,460
in body temperature and changes
in the way that blood flow

287
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,290
is happening in your
body, and in particular

288
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,710
on these palmer surfaces and in your face

289
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,920
that is going to likely
diminish performance.

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,030
So if you enjoy caffeine
and you're accustomed to it,

291
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,840
so-called caffeine adapted,
enjoy it before your training.

292
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,530
If you regularly, excuse
me, if you do not regularly

293
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,700
use caffeine, then you probably
do not want to view caffeine

294
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,340
as a performance enhancing tool.

295
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,970
And while we're on the topic of tools

296
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,760
and because this is a month
on athletic performance

297
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,093
and exercise and physical skill learning,

298
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,770
I want to offer an additional tool

299
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,060
that I've certainly found
useful, which is how to relieve

300
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,590
the so-called side stitch or side cramp

301
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,373
when running or swimming.

302
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,520
This actually relates to respiration

303
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,073
and to the nervous system
and it is not a cramp.

304
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,530
If you've ever been out
running and you felt like

305
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,530
you had a pain on your side,

306
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,930
that pain could be any number of things,

307
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,450
but what feels like cramping of your side

308
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,493
is actually due to what's
called collateralization

309
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,930
of the phrenic nerve which
is a lot harder to say

310
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,020
than a side cramp or a side stitch.

311
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,120
But here's the situation.

312
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
You have a set of nerves, which
is called the phrenic nerve

313
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
P-H-R-E-N-I-C.

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,940
The phrenic nerve, which
extends down from your brainstem

315
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,020
essentially, this region to your diaphragm

316
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,700
to control your breathing.

317
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,330
It has a collateral,
meaning it has a branch

318
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,033
just like the branch on a tree
that innovates your liver.

319
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,960
And if you are not
breathing deeply enough,

320
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,230
what can happen is you can
get what's called sometimes

321
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,020
a referenced pain.

322
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,940
Reference pain is probably
going to be familiar

323
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,590
to any of you have ever read

324
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,460
about how to recognize heart attack.

325
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,620
People have heart attacks
will sometimes have pain

326
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,870
on one side of their body, the left arm,

327
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,280
sometimes people that have
pain in a part of their back

328
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,230
or suddenly also get
pain in their shoulder

329
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,063
or part of their face.

330
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:13,530
This has to do with the fact
that many of our nerves branch,

331
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,960
meaning they're collateralized

332
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,730
to different organs and areas of the body.

333
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,983
And the way those nerves
are woven together,

334
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,630
it's often the case that
if we disrupt the pattern

335
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,150
of firing of electrical activity

336
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,480
in one of those nerve branches

337
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,540
that the other ones are affected too.

338
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,970
The side stitch, the pain
in your side as often

339
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,150
because of the contractions
of the diaphragm

340
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,730
because of the way you're
breathing while you're exercising,

341
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,370
running, or swimming or biking.

342
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,480
And as a consequence, you
feel pain in your side

343
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,490
but that's not a cramp.

344
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,810
The way to relieve it is very simple.

345
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,510
You do the physiological
side that I've talked about

346
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,080
in previous episodes of
the podcast and elsewhere

347
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,070
which has a double
inhale through the nose,

348
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,050
very deep and then a long exhale.

349
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,470
And you might want to repeat
that two or three times.

350
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,930
Typically that will
relieve the side stitch

351
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,750
because of the way that it
changes the firing patterns

352
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,430
of the phrenic nerve.

353
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,120
So the side stitch is
annoying, it's painful,

354
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,800
sometimes we think we're dehydrated

355
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,990
and you might be dehydrated.

356
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,310
But oftentimes it's just
that we're breathing

357
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,480
in a way that causes some
referenced pain of the liver.

358
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,240
We call it a side stitch or a side cramp,

359
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,730
and you can relieve it very easily

360
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,013
through the double inhale, long exhale.

361
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,750
That pattern done two or three times,

362
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,610
often you can continue
to engage in the exercise

363
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,750
while you do the double inhale exhale,

364
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,020
and it will just relieve itself that way.

365
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,820
So give it a try if you
experience the side stitch.

366
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,670
Some people I know are also
doing the double inhale,

367
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,890
long exhale during long
continuous bouts of exercise.

368
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,730
I actually do this when I run.

369
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,910
We have decent data
although these are still

370
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,070
unpublished data that that can engage

371
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,860
a kind of regular cadence
of heart rate variability.

372
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,260
So there are a number of reasons
why this physiological side

373
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,570
can be useful, but it
certainly can be useful

374
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,710
for relieving the side stitch
or so-called side cramp.

375
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,490
Let's talk about the
acquisition of new skills.

376
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,490
These could be skills such as
a golf swing or a tennis swing

377
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,520
or you're shooting free throws
or you're learning to dance

378
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,760
or you're learning an instrument.

379
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,540
I'm mainly going to focus
on athletic performance.

380
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,933
There are basically two types of skills.

381
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,793
Open loop and closed loop.

382
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,290
Open loop skills are
skills where you perform

383
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,610
some sort of motor
action and then you wait

384
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,550
and you get immediate feedback

385
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,980
as to whether or not it
was done correctly or not.

386
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,020
A good example will be
throwing darts at a dartboard.

387
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,760
So if you throw the dart, you get feedback

388
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,290
about whether or not you hit the bullseye,

389
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,420
you're off the dart board,
or you're some other location

390
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,680
on the dart board, that's open loop.

391
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,160
Closed loop would be something
that's more continuous.

392
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,710
So let's say you're a
runner and you're starting

393
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,300
to do some speed work and some sprints.

394
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,490
And you're running and
you can kind of feel

395
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,670
whether or not you're running correctly,

396
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,140
or maybe even have a coach
and they're correcting

397
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,963
your stride or you're trying
to do some sort of skill,

398
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:21,240
like a hopscotch skill,
which maybe you're doing

399
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,700
the ladder work where you're stepping

400
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,030
between designated spaces on the ground.

401
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,380
That's closed loop because as you go,

402
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,640
you can adjust your behavior
and you can adjust the distance

403
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,430
of your steps, or you
can adjust your speed

404
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,640
or you can adjust your
posture and you are able

405
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,290
to essentially do more
practice per unit time

406
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,112
but you're getting feedback
on a moment to moment basis.

407
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,160
So you have open loop and closed loop.

408
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,440
And just to make this very clear,

409
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,910
open loop would be
practicing your tennis serve.

410
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,010
So let's say that you set a target

411
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,520
on the other side of the net.

412
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,960
You throw the ball up
and you hit the ball,

413
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,793
it goes over that's open-loop.

414
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,770
You'll know whether or
not you were in the court,

415
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,640
you were on the location you wanted to hit

416
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,260
or close to it or not, that's open loop.

417
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,582
Closed loop would be if
you're in a regular can.

418
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:14,959
So maybe you're learning a swim stroke,

419
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,700
or maybe you're trying to
learn a particular rhythm

420
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,173
on the drum.

421
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:19,080
So maybe you're trying to
learn a particular beat.

422
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,350
I'm not very musical, so I'm
not going to embarrass myself

423
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,793
by giving an example of
this, although later I will,

424
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,580
where you're trying to get
a particular rhythm down.

425
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,040
And if you're not getting it,
you can adjust in real time

426
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,000
and try and catch up or slow
down or speed up, et cetera.

427
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,560
So hopefully you'll understand
open loop and closed loop.

428
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,990
You should always know before
you try and learn a skill,

429
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,780
whether or not it's
open loop or closed loop

430
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,470
and I'll return to why
that's important shortly.

431
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,990
But if you want to learn something,

432
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,033
ask is it open loop or closed loop.

433
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,540
There are essentially three
components of any skill

434
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,510
that involves motor movement.

435
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,660
And those are sensory
perception, actually perceiving

436
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,180
what you are doing and
what's happening around you.

437
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,440
So what you see, what you hear,

438
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,480
sometimes you're paying
attention to what you're doing

439
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
specifically like the
trajectory of your arm

440
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,330
or how you're moving your feet.

441
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,700
If you're learning to dance,
sometimes you're more focused

442
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,600
on something that's
happening outside of you,

443
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,840
like you're listening
for something in music

444
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,750
or you're paying attention

445
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,220
to the way your partner
is moving, et cetera.

446
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,280
So there's sensory input.

447
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,500
Then there are the actual movements.

448
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,360
So they're the movements
of your limbs and body.

449
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,950
And then there's something
called proprioception

450
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,420
and proprioception is often discussed

451
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,110
as kind of a sixth sense of
knowing where your limbs are

452
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,140
in relation to your body.

453
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,150
So proprioception is vitally important.

454
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,210
If I reached down and pick
up this pen and pick it up,

455
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,020
I'm not thinking about
where the pen in my hand is

456
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,020
relative to my body, but
proprioceptively, I'm aware of it

457
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,150
at kind of a six sense
deeper subconscious level.

458
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,280
I can also make myself
aware of where my limbs are.

459
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,130
And typically when we learn,
we are placing more focus

460
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,000
on proprioception than we do ordinarily.

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
So if I get up from this
chair and I happen to walk

462
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,870
out of the room, I don't
think about where my feet

463
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,860
are landing relative to one another.

464
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,430
But if my leg had fallen asleep

465
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,090
because I had been leaning on
one of the nerves of my leg

466
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,680
or something like that, and my
leg feels all tingly or numb.

467
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,350
I and you, if this were to happen to you,

468
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,980
would immediately notice a shift in gait.

469
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,600
It would feel strange,
I'd have to pay attention

470
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,460
to how I'm stepping.

471
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,416
And the reason is I'm not getting

472
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,180
any proprioceptive feedback.

473
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,880
Now, skill learning has a
lot of other dimensions too,

474
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,420
but those are the main ones
that we're going to focus on.

475
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,760
So just to remind you,
you need to know open loop

476
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,230
or closed loop and you need
to know whether or not,

477
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,520
excuse me, you need to know
that there's sensory perception

478
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,333
what you're paying attention to,

479
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,510
movements themselves and proprioception.

480
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,420
And there's one other important
thing that you need to know

481
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,660
which is that movement
of any kind is generated

482
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,730
from one, two or three sources
within your nervous system,

483
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,910
within your brain and body.

484
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,520
These are central pattern generators

485
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,363
which are sometimes called
CSPGs, excuse me, CPGSs,

486
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:23,222
CSPGs are something entirely
different in biology.

487
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,990
CPGSs, this just goes to
show that I have a module.

488
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,230
CSPGs are chondroid and
sulfate proteoglycans.

489
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,880
They have nothing to do with this topic.

490
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,840
CPGSs are central pattern
generators or CPGs,

491
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,370
they're sometimes called.

492
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,370
These CPGs are in your
spinal cord, mine and yours,

493
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,000
different ones and they
generate repetitive movements.

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,070
So if you're walking, if you're
running, if you're cycling,

495
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,340
if you're breathing,
which presumably you are

496
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,700
and you're doing that in a
regular rhythmic cadence,

497
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,810
central pattern generators
are controlling that movement.

498
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,540
After you learn how to
walk, run, swim, cycle,

499
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,230
do anything really, much
of the work is handed off

500
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,650
to the central pattern generators.

501
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,540
And there were experiments that were done

502
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,700
in the 60s, 70s and 80s
that actually looked

503
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,700
at decerebrate animals and
even decerebrate humans.

504
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,650
These are humans and animals
that lack a cerebral cortex.

505
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,310
They lack much of the brain
and yet they can engage

506
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,660
in what's called a fictive movement.

507
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,730
So it sounds like a kind
of barbaric experiment.

508
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,117
I'm glad I wasn't the
one to have to do them

509
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,620
but this is the stuff of
neuroscience textbooks

510
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,620
that cats or dogs or mice that
have their neocortex removed

511
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,570
put them on a treadmill,
they'll walk just fine.

512
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,820
And they will adjust their
speed of walking just fine

513
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,250
even though they basically
lack all their thinking

514
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,597
and decision-making brain.

515
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,960
And it turns out humans that have,

516
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,750
unfortunately, massive
strokes to their cortex

517
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,170
and lack any neocortex but preserve

518
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,570
the central pattern generators
will also walk just fine,

519
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,890
even though they lack any of
the other stuff in the brain.

520
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,290
So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing,

521
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,000
and they control a lot of
our already learned behavior.

522
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,930
When you're really good at something,

523
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,273
CPGs are controlling a
lot of that behavior.

524
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:24,760
And that's true also for a golf swing.

525
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,700
Even if it's not really repetitive,

526
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,830
somebody who's really good
at golf it's going to,

527
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,550
I guess you call it a T.

528
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,570
You put the ball on the T.

529
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,750
I show with my knowledge of golf.

530
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,450
I've only done mini golf, frankly,

531
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:37,750
but someday maybe I'll learn how to golf,

532
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,490
but you set the golf ball down and swing,

533
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,920
set the golf ball down, swing.

534
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,780
Central pattern generators
are going to handle

535
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,870
a lot of that.

536
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,580
If I were to go to the golf course.

537
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,000
Stanford has a beautiful golf course.

538
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
If I were to go out there
and put a ball on the T,

539
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,900
my central pattern generators
would not be involved

540
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,280
in that at all.

541
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,460
The moment I bring the club back to swing,

542
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,860
it's going to engage other things.

543
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,670
And the other things
that's going to engage

544
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,170
because I don't know
that behavior now or then

545
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,530
is upper motor neurons.

546
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,560
We have motor neurons in our cortex,

547
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,270
in our neocortex that
control deliberate action.

548
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,520
And those are the ones
that you're engaging

549
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,200
when you are learning.

550
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,410
Those are the ones that
you have to pay attention

551
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,120
in order to engage.

552
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,350
And that's what's happening, for instance,

553
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,194
if I decide I'm going to
reach down and pick up my pen,

554
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:31,181
which I rarely think about,
but now I'm thinking about it

555
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:32,014
and I'm going to do this
in a very deliberate way.

556
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:33,720
I'm going to grab with
these two fingers and lift.

557
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,907
My upper motor neurons are now involved.

558
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:39,340
So upper motor neurons are very important

559
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,490
because a little bit later in the episode

560
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,400
when we talk about how
to use visualization

561
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,050
in order to accelerate skill learning,

562
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,510
it's going to leverage
these upper motor neurons

563
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,100
in very particular ways.

564
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,770
So we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,

565
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,850
upper motor neurons for
deliberate unlearned movements

566
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,730
or movements that we are
in the process of learning.

567
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,490
And then we have what are
called lower motor neurons.

568
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:05,000
Lower motor neurons are
the ones in our spinal cord

569
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,840
that send little wires out to our muscles

570
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,873
which actually caused the
firing of those muscle fibers.

571
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,910
So the way to think
about this as you've got

572
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,430
upper motor neurons which talk to CPGs

573
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,640
and the lower motor neurons.

574
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,080
So it's really simple.

575
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,340
And now, you know most
everything there is to know

576
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,330
about the neural pathways
controlling movement,

577
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,263
at least for sake of this discussion.

578
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,940
So anytime we learn
something, we have to decide

579
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,940
what to place our sensory perception on,

580
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,360
meaning what are we going to focus on.

581
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,030
That's critical if
you're listening to this

582
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,450
and you're the type of person
who likes taking notes,

583
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,680
this should be the
second question you ask.

584
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,810
Remember the first question
is, is it open loop

585
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,040
or closed loop?

586
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,823
The second question should be,

587
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,150
what should I focus my attention
on, auditory attention,

588
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,250
visual attention or proprioception.

589
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,380
Should I focus on where my
limbs are relative to my body

590
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,820
or should I focus on the outcome?

591
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,640
This is a critical distinction.

592
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,010
You can decide to learn
how to do a golf swing

593
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,690
or learn how to shoot free throws

594
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,901
or learn how to dance tango

595
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,160
and decide that you are going to focus

596
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,810
on the movements of your partner

597
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,380
or the positions of your feet.

598
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,150
You maybe are going to look at them,

599
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,940
maybe you're going to sense them.

600
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,980
You're going to actually
feel where they are,

601
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,230
or maybe you're going
to sense the position

602
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,170
and posture of your body,
which is more proprioception.

603
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,220
So you have to allocate your attention.

604
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,490
And I'm going to tell you how
to allocate your attention

605
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,500
best in order to learn faster.

606
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,760
So these are the sorts of
decisions that you have to make.

607
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,640
Fortunately for you,
you don't have to think

608
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,730
about whether or not you're going to use

609
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,090
your upper motor neurons
and your lower motor neurons

610
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,734
or not, because if you don't
know how to do something,

611
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:45,567
you're automatically going to engage

612
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:46,410
your upper motor neurons.

613
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,440
And if you do, then
you're not going to use

614
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,310
your upper motor neurons.

615
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,840
You're mainly going to rely
on central pattern generators.

616
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,980
You are always using
your lower motor neurons

617
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,130
to move muscle.

618
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,790
So we can really simplify things now.

619
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,270
I've given you a lot of
information but we can simplify it.

620
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,400
Basically open loop or closed
loop, that's one question

621
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,160
and what am I going to focus on?

622
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,840
And then your neurology
will take care of the rest.

623
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,693
So now I want to talk about
realistic expectations.

624
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,490
Somewhere in Hollywood presumably,

625
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,910
it got embedded in somebody's mind

626
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,440
that instant skill
acquisition was possible,

627
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,490
that you could take a particular pill

628
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,140
or you could touch a particular object

629
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,850
or you could have a wand wave over you

630
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,660
and you would suddenly have a skill.

631
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,703
And so that is the result
of Hollywood at all.

632
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,690
It doesn't exist, at least not in reality.

633
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,040
And I love movies, but
it simply doesn't exist.

634
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,660
Then the self-help literature
created another rule

635
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,310
called the 10,000 hours rule.

636
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,930
And frankly, that doesn't
really match the literature,

637
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,030
at least the scientific literature either.

638
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,890
I like it because it implies
that learning takes time,

639
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,630
which is more accurate
than the Hollywood at all

640
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,000
instant skill acquisition rule,

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,710
which isn't really a rule, it's a myth.

642
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,520
But the 10,000 hours rule
overlook something crucial,

643
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,620
which is that it's not about hours,

644
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,410
it's about repetitions.

645
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:27,860
Now, of course there's a
relationship between time

646
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,860
and repetitions, but there
are some beautiful experiments

647
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,860
that point to the fact
that by simple adjustment

648
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,800
of what you are focused
on as you attempt to learn

649
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,590
a new skill, you can adjust
the number of repetitions

650
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,840
that you do, you adjust
your motivation for learning

651
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,363
and you can vastly accelerate learning.

652
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,270
Some of you may recognize
this by its internet name,

653
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,950
which is not a scientific term,

654
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,220
which is the super Mario effect.

655
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,060
There's actually a quite
good video on YouTube

656
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,750
describing the super Mario effect.

657
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,960
I think it was a YouTuber
who has I think a background

658
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,070
in science and he did an
interesting experiment.

659
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,770
And I'll talk about his experiment first

660
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,750
and then I will talk
about the neurobiology

661
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,220
that supports the result that he got.

662
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,100
The super Mario effect relates to the game

663
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,170
super Mario brothers, but
you'll see why at the end.

664
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:30,810
But basically what they did
was they had 50,000 subjects,

665
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,810
which is a enormous number
of subjects learn a program,

666
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,240
essentially taking words
from a computer program

667
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,740
or the commands for a computer program

668
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,010
that were kind of clustered
in a column on the right.

669
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,640
So these are the sorts of
things that computer programmers

670
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,890
will be familiar with
but other people won't.

671
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,120
And those commands are essentially,

672
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,430
they essentially translate
to things like go forward.

673
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,540
And then if it's a right
hand turn in the maze,

674
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,420
then go right and continue
until you hit a choice point,

675
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,725
et cetera.

676
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,940
So it's a bunch of instructions,
but the job of the subjects

677
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,380
in these experiments were to
organize those instructions

678
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,270
in a particular way that
would allow a little cursor

679
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,740
to move through the main successfully.

680
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,440
So basically the goal was,
or at least what the subjects

681
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,120
were told is that anyone can
learn to computer program.

682
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,860
And if somebody can just
organize the instructions

683
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,210
in the right way, then they can program

684
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,483
this little cursor to move
through amaze, very simple.

685
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,790
And yet, if you don't have any background

686
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,800
in computer programming,
or even if you do,

687
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,090
it takes some skill.

688
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,740
You have to know what commands to give

689
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,750
in what particular order.

690
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,810
And they made that very easy.

691
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,700
You could just assemble them in a list

692
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,793
over onto the right.

693
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,720
So people started doing this.

694
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Now there were two groups and
some one half of the subjects,

695
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,150
if they got it wrong, meaning
they entered a command

696
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,960
and the cursor would move
and it was the wrong command

697
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,030
for this little cursor
to move through the maze,

698
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,903
they saw a signal jump up
on their screen that said,

699
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,783
that did not work, please try again.

700
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,680
That's it, if they put
in the wrong command

701
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,560
or is in the wrong sequence,
it'll say that did not work

702
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,994
please try again.

703
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:20,410
And then the subjects would
reorganize the instructions

704
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,820
and then the little cursor would continue.

705
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,600
And if they got it wrong again,

706
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,240
it would say that does not
work, please try again.

707
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,200
The other half of the subjects,
if they got something wrong

708
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,200
were told you just lost five
points, please continue.

709
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,430
So, that's the only
difference in the feedback

710
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,930
that they got.

711
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,770
Now I have to confess,
I would have predicted

712
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,020
based on my knowledge
of dopamine circuitry

713
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,020
and reward contingency
and epinephrin and stress

714
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,410
and motivated learning.

715
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,750
And this other thing that we've been told

716
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,860
in many many books on behavioral economics

717
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,140
and in the self-help literature,

718
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,780
which is that people will work much harder

719
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,240
to prevent losing something than they will

720
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,390
to gain something, that
you hear all the time.

721
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,110
And it turns out that that's
not at all what happened.

722
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,730
If they looked at the
success rate of the subjects,

723
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,930
what they found was that
the subjects that were told

724
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,930
that did not work, please try
again, had a 68% success rate.

725
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,330
68% of them went on to
successfully program this cursor

726
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,000
moving through the maze.

727
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,540
Whereas the ones that were
told you lost five points

728
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,500
had a 52% success rate, which
is a significant difference.

729
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,140
But the source of the success
or the lack of success

730
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,070
is really interesting.

731
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,760
The subjects that were
told that did not work,

732
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,760
please try again, tried many,
many more times per unit time.

733
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,570
In other words, they made
more attempts at programming

734
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,350
this thing to allow this cursor
to move through the maze.

735
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,000
Whereas the people that were
told you lost five points

736
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,190
gave up earlier or gave up entirely.

737
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,430
Okay, so let's just step back from this

738
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,170
because to me, this was very surprising.

739
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,240
It violates a lot of things that I'd heard

740
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
in the kind of popular culture
or the self-help literature

741
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,900
that people will work much
harder to avoid losing something

742
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,590
than they will to gain something.

743
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,430
And it didn't really fit
with what I understood

744
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,493
about reward contingencies and dopamine,

745
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,550
but it did fit well with
another set of experiments

746
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,810
that I'm very familiar with

747
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,670
from the neuroscience literature.

748
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,360
And I'll give you the punchline first.

749
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,450
And then we're going to
take what these data mean

750
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:41,390
and we're going to talk
about a learning protocol

751
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,110
that you can use that will
allow you to learn skills faster

752
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,490
by willingly participating
in more repetitions

753
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,560
of the skill learning,
meaning you will want

754
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,370
to do more repetitions even
if you're getting it wrong

755
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,790
some or most of the time.

756
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,350
So the experiment that
I want to tell you about

757
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,850
is called the tube test.

758
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,980
And this is generally done in mice,

759
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,560
although it's sometimes been done in rats

760
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,510
and it has a lot of
parallels to some things

761
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,230
that you've probably
seen and experienced even

762
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,239
in human life, in regular
life, maybe even in your life.

763
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,009
So here's the experiment.

764
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,820
You take two rats, you put
them in a tube or two mice,

765
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,159
you put them in a tube.

766
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,819
And mice and rats, they don't
like to share the same tube.

767
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,550
So what they'll do is they'll
start pushing each other

768
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,570
back and forth, back and forth.

769
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,730
Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice

770
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,830
pushes the other one out.

771
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,380
The one that got pushed out is the loser,

772
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,430
the one that gets the tube is the winner.

773
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,139
Now you take the winner, you
give it a new competitor.

774
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:48,049
And what you find is that the mouse or rat

775
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,560
that won previously has a much higher

776
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,750
than chance probability of
winning the second time.

777
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,610
In other words, winning
before leads to winning again.

778
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,930
And the reverse is also true.

779
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,860
If you take the loser
and you put that loser in

780
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,003
with another mouse,
fresh mouse, new mouse,

781
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,430
the loser typically will lose
at much greater probability

782
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,263
than chance.

783
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:16,570
And this is not related to
differences in strength or size

784
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,670
or testosterone or any other things

785
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,130
that might leap to mind
as explanations for this

786
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,510
because those were all controlled for.

787
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,650
Now that results have been
known about for decades.

788
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,550
But three years ago, there
was a paper published

789
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,530
in the Journal Science,
phenomenal journal.

790
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,090
It's one of the three apex journals,

791
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,550
that examined the brain area
that's involved in this.

792
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,450
Turns out a particular
area of the frontal cortex

793
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,780
for those of you that want to know.

794
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,120
And they did a simple experiment
where the experimenters

795
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,560
increased or decreased the
activity of this brain area

796
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,580
in the prefrontal cortex,

797
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,130
little sub region of
the prefrontal cortex.

798
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,373
And what they found is if they
stimulated this brain area,

799
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,110
a mouse or rat, regardless
of whether or not

800
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,130
it had been a winner or loser before,

801
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,393
became a winner every single time.

802
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,760
And they showed that if
they blocked the activity

803
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,750
of this brain area,
regardless of whether or not

804
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,780
the mouse or rat had
been a winner or loser,

805
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,721
it became a loser every single time.

806
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,660
And this translated to other scenarios,

807
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,500
other competitive scenarios
where they'd put a bunch of mice

808
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,490
or rats in a kind of cool chamber,

809
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,100
they'd have a little
heat lamp in the corner

810
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,223
and mice like heat.

811
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:28,380
And there was only enough
space for one mouse

812
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,340
to be under the heat.

813
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,370
And the one that had won in the tube test

814
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,960
or that had the brain area stimulated

815
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,163
always got the nice warm spot.

816
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,440
So what is this magic brain
area, what is it doing?

817
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,400
Well, the reason I'm
bringing this up today

818
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
and the reason I'm
bringing it up on the heels

819
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,350
of the super Mario effect
is that stimulation

820
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,310
of this brain area had a very simple

821
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,950
and very important effect,

822
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,370
which was, it led to more
forward steps, more repetitions,

823
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:01,530
more effort, but not in terms
of sheer might and will,

824
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,653
not digging deeper, just more
repetitions per unit time.

825
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:09,810
And the losers had fewer
repetitions per unit time.

826
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,410
So the super Mario effect,
this online experiment

827
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,240
and the tube test, which has been done

828
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,860
by various labs and
repeated again and again

829
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,230
point to a simple but very important rule,

830
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,590
which is neither the 10,000 hours rule

831
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,900
nor the magic wand Hollywood
version of learning.

832
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,510
But rather the
neuro-biological explanation

833
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,310
for learning a skill
is you want to perform

834
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,563
as many repetitions per unit
time, as you possibly can.

835
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,810
At least when you're first
trying to learn a skill.

836
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,120
I want to repeat that, you want
to perform as many repetitions

837
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,380
as you possibly can at least
when you're first trying

838
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,453
to learn a skill.

839
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
Now that might sound like
a duh, it just more reps,

840
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,090
but it's not so obvious.

841
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,400
There's no reason why more repetitions

842
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,830
should necessarily lead to faster learning

843
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,940
because you could also say,
well, more repetitions,

844
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,150
you can make more errors

845
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,630
and those errors would
lead to poor performance

846
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,920
like misstepping a number of times.

847
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,630
And in these cases, there's
very little feedback.

848
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,780
It's not like every time
the rat pushes forward

849
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,010
or moves back that it is sensing,

850
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,830
oh I'm winning, I'm losing,
I'm winning, I'm losing

851
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,478
on a micro level.

852
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:24,900
It probably does that as it
starts to push the other one out

853
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,730
the rat or mouse probably
thinks, "I'm winning."

854
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,540
And as it's backing up, it
probably thinks, "I'm losing."

855
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,923
As you play the game,
the super Mario game,

856
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,080
you are told, nope, that didn't work.

857
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,130
Nope, that didn't work, please try again.

858
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,540
But the important thing
is that the winners

859
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,490
are always generating more
repetitions per unit time.

860
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,780
It's just a repeat of
performance, repeat of performance

861
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,170
even if there are errors.

862
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,080
And that points to
something vitally important,

863
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,080
which is reps are important
but making error reps

864
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,310
is also important.

865
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,782
In fact, it might be the
most important factor.

866
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:08,060
So let's talk about errors and
why those solve the problem

867
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,940
of what to focus on.

868
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,780
Because as I said earlier, if
you want to learn something,

869
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,330
you need to know if it's
open loop or closed loop

870
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,400
and you need to know what to focus on,

871
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,050
where to place your perception.

872
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,130
And that seems like a tough task

873
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,580
but errors will tell you
exactly what to focus on.

874
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,650
So let's talk about errors and
why you can leverage errors

875
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,630
to accelerate skill learning.

876
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,640
Okay, so we've established that performing

877
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,660
the maximum number of
repetitions per training session

878
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,680
is going to be advantageous.

879
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,060
And that might seem obvious
but there's a shadowy side

880
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,650
to that, which is, well why
would I want to just repeat

881
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,505
the same thing over and over
again if I'm getting it wrong,

882
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,085
90% of the time.

883
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:52,090
And the reason is that
the errors actually cue

884
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,180
your nervous system to two things;

885
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,180
one to error correction and
the other is it opens the door

886
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,940
or the window for neuroplasticity.

887
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,280
Neuroplasticity is the brain
and nervous system's ability

888
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,630
to change in response to experience,

889
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,480
essentially to custom modify itself

890
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,940
in order to perform anything better.

891
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,490
We did an entire month on neuroplasticity

892
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,680
and I talked a little bit about errors

893
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,100
and why they're important.

894
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,400
Now we're going to make this very concrete

895
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,640
and operationalize it,
make it very actionable.

896
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,920
There was a paper that
was published in 2021

897
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,620
from Norman at all.

898
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,050
This is a very important paper.

899
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,550
It was published in the Journal Neuron

900
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,560
which is a cell press
journal, excellent journal.

901
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,420
The title of the paper
gives it away essentially,

902
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,540
which is post error
recruitment of frontal sensory

903
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,540
cortical projections promotes attention.

904
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Now, what that says is that
when you make an error,

905
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,660
it causes an activation of the brain areas

906
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,740
that anchor your attention.

907
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,970
Remember we need perception, attention,

908
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,270
which they're essentially the same thing.

909
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,410
We need proprioception
and we need the upper

910
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,770
and lower motor neurons to
communicate in the proper ways.

911
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,840
And this vital question is
what to pay attention to.

912
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,090
Errors tell your nervous system

913
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,990
that something needs to change.

914
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,020
So if you are performing a task or a skill

915
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,544
like you're learning how to
dance and you're stepping

916
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:20,750
on the other person's
toes or you're fumbling

917
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,290
or you're not getting it right,

918
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,380
those errors are opening the
possibility for plasticity.

919
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,301
If you walk away at that point,

920
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:30,820
you've made the exact wrong choice.

921
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,340
Unless the errors are somehow
hazardous to your health

922
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,800
or somebody else's wellbeing,
you want to continue

923
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
to engage at a high repetition rate.

924
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,730
That's really where the
learning is possible.

925
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,750
Without errors, the brain
is not in a position

926
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,220
to change itself.

927
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,230
Errors actually cue the
frontal cortex networks,

928
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,480
what we call top-down processing
and the neuromodulators,

929
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,190
things like dopamine and
acetylcholine and epinephrin

930
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,010
that will allow for plasticity.

931
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,820
So while the super Mario experiment,

932
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,160
the maze experiment was only
focused on generating errors,

933
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,060
telling people that wasn't
right, please try again

934
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,820
or that wasn't right,
you lost five points.

935
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,780
The key distinction is
that the errors themselves

936
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,440
cued people to the fact that they needed

937
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,180
to change something.

938
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,090
So if you're trying to learn a new skill

939
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,480
and you're screwing up and
you're making mistakes,

940
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,940
the more mistakes you
make, the more plastic

941
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,840
your brain becomes such
that when you get it right,

942
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,520
that correct pattern will be
rewarded and consolidated.

943
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,390
And you can trust that it will

944
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,860
because the performance
of something correctly

945
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,710
is associated with the release

946
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,610
of this neuromodulator dopamine.

947
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,630
Dopamine is involved in
craving and motivation.

948
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,820
It's involved in a lot of things,

949
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,013
but it's also involved in learning.

950
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,010
We will do an entire episode
on dopamine and learning

951
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,880
but because some of you
are probably wondering,

952
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,550
this does not mean that just
increasing your dopamine levels

953
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,830
before learning will
allow you to learn faster.

954
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,660
In fact, increasing your
dopamine levels before learning

955
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,410
using pharmacology will actually reduce

956
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,930
what's called the signal to noise.

957
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,400
It will make these increases in dopamine

958
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,127
that pop up in your brain that
suddenly make you realize,

959
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:14,750
"Oh, I got that one right."

960
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,220
It will make those smaller relative

961
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,440
to the background levels of dopamine.

962
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,500
You want a big spike in
dopamine when you perform

963
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,110
a motor pattern correctly and
you want to make lots of errors,

964
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,630
many, many repetitions of errors

965
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,200
in order to get to that
correct performance.

966
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,830
Now, if you're like most
people you're going to do this

967
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,780
in a way that's somewhat random.

968
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,450
Meaning let's say it's a tennis serve.

969
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,630
I can't play tennis,

970
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,880
I think I've probably played tennis twice.

971
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,550
So if I throw the ball
up in the air and hit it,

972
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,590
I'm going to get it wrong
and probably hit the net,

973
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,423
then it hit the net.

974
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:48,760
Then I'll probably go too long

975
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,160
then I'll probably go over the fence.

976
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,903
At some point, I like to
think I'll get it correct.

977
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,550
The dopamine signal for that
is going to be quite big

978
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,497
and I'll think, "Okay,
what did I do there?

979
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:01,267
"I actually don't know, I
wasn't paying attention.

980
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,610
"What I was paying attention
to is whether or not

981
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,413
"the ball went to the correct location

982
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:06,246
"on the opposite side of the net."

983
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:07,610
Remember it's an open loop move,

984
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,850
so I don't actually know
what I did correctly.

985
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,240
But your nervous system
will take care of that

986
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,100
provided I in this case
complete more and more

987
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,160
and more repetitions.

988
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,060
Now, if I were to just elevate
my basil level of dopamine

989
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,739
by taking, I don't know,
1500 milligrams L tyrasine

990
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:25,930
or something, that would
be bad because the increase

991
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,633
in dopamine would actually be much lower.

992
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,370
We would say the delta is smaller.

993
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,280
The signal to noise is smaller

994
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,830
if my overall levels of
dopamine are very, very high.

995
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,840
So I'm actually going to learn less well.

996
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,470
So for skill learning,
motor skill learning,

997
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,130
increasing your dopamine levels
prior is not a good idea.

998
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,610
It might help with motivation
to get to the learning

999
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,590
but it's not going to improve
the plasticity process itself

1000
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,050
and it's likely to hinder it.

1001
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,650
And so that's very important.

1002
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:58,650
So these errors cue the brain
that something was wrong

1003
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,970
and they open up the
possibility for plasticity.

1004
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,850
It's what sometimes
called the framing effect,

1005
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,435
it frames what's important.

1006
00:45:06,435 --> 00:45:09,010
And so I think this is a
shift that we've heard about,

1007
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,500
growth mindset which is the
incredible discovery and theory

1008
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,840
and practice of my colleague,
Carol Dweck at Stanford.

1009
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,800
This is distinct from that.

1010
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,090
This isn't about motivation to learn,

1011
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,590
this is about how you actually learn.

1012
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,780
So the key is designate a
particular block of time

1013
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,730
that you are going to perform repetitions.

1014
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,190
So maybe that's 30 minutes,
maybe that's an hour.

1015
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,720
Work for time and then try and perform

1016
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,180
the maximum number of repetitions
that you can do safely

1017
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,060
for you and others per unit time.

1018
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,429
That's going to be the best
way to approach learning

1019
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:44,060
for most sessions.

1020
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,470
I will talk about other
things that one can do,

1021
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,240
but making errors is key.

1022
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,740
And this isn't a motivational speech.

1023
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,167
I'm not saying, "Oh, go make errors,

1024
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,051
"errors are good for you.

1025
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:53,884
"You have to fail in order to win."

1026
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,540
No, you have to fail in order
to open up the possibility

1027
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,390
of plasticity, but you
have to fail many times

1028
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,210
within the same session.

1029
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,090
And those failures will cue your attention

1030
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,920
to the appropriate sensory events.

1031
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,120
Now, sometimes we're working with a coach.

1032
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,740
And so this is a shout
out to all the coaches,

1033
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,810
thank you for doing what you do.

1034
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:17,640
However, there needs to be at least

1035
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,660
what the scientific literature say.

1036
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,970
There needs to be a period
of each training session

1037
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,440
whereby the athlete or
the person of any kind

1038
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,800
can simply pay attention to their errors

1039
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,050
without their attention
being cued to something else.

1040
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,497
A really well-trained coach will say,

1041
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:34,547
"Oh, your elbows swinging too high,

1042
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:36,407
"or you're not gripping the racket

1043
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:38,360
"in the appropriate way," et cetera.

1044
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,910
They can see things that
the practitioner can't see.

1045
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,040
And of course that's
the vitally important.

1046
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,920
But the practitioner also needs to use

1047
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,970
this error recognition signal,

1048
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,777
they need to basically focus on something

1049
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:56,200
and the errors are going to
tell them what to focus on.

1050
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,450
So put simply there needs
to be a period of time

1051
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,420
in which it's just
repetition after repetition,

1052
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,253
after repetition.

1053
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:04,490
I think many people including coaches

1054
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,450
are afraid that bad
habits will get ingrained.

1055
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,110
And while indeed that's possible,

1056
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,510
it's very important
that these errors occur

1057
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,750
in order to cue the attentional systems

1058
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,960
and to open the door for plasticity.

1059
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,787
So if I'm told, "Look, I'm
standing a little wide,

1060
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:22,230
"I need to tighten up
my stance a little bit."

1061
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,720
Great, but then I need to
generate many repetitions

1062
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,360
from that tighten stance.

1063
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,500
So if I'm constantly being
cued from the outside

1064
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,300
about what I'm incorrectly,

1065
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,480
that's not going to be as efficient.

1066
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,960
So for some people,
these learning sessions

1067
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,400
might be 10 minutes, for some
people, it might be an hour.

1068
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,210
Whatever you can allocate
because your lifestyles

1069
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,810
will vary in your whether or not

1070
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:43,950
you're a professional
athlete, et cetera will vary.

1071
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,300
You want to get the maximum
number of repetitions in

1072
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,590
and you want to make errors.

1073
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,830
That's allowing for plasticity.

1074
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,490
So science points to the fact

1075
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,540
that there's a particular
sequencing of learning sessions

1076
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,400
that will allow you to learn faster

1077
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,780
and to retain the skill learning

1078
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,030
and involves doing exactly
as I just described,

1079
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,110
which is getting as many
repetitions as you can

1080
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:10,340
in the learning session,
paying attention to the errors

1081
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,173
that you make.

1082
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,670
And then the rewards
that will be generated,

1083
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,620
again, these are neurochemical rewards

1084
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,930
from the successful
performance of a movement

1085
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,390
or the approximate successful performance.

1086
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,970
So maybe you get the golf
swing better but not perfect,

1087
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,340
but that's still going to be rewarded

1088
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,660
with this neurochemical mechanism.

1089
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,730
And then after the session,

1090
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,930
you need to do something very specific

1091
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,493
which is nothing.

1092
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,703
That's right.

1093
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,130
There are beautiful
data describing neurons

1094
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,950
in our hippocampus, this
area of our brain involved

1095
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,983
in the consolidation of new memories.

1096
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,963
Those data points to
the fact that in sleep,

1097
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,220
there's a replay of
the sequence of neurons

1098
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,000
that were involved in certain
behaviors the previous day

1099
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,403
and sometimes the
previous day before that.

1100
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,550
However, there are also data that show

1101
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,100
that after a skill learning session,

1102
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:16,100
any kind of motor movement
provided you're not bringing in

1103
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,223
a lot more additional new sensory stimuli,

1104
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,460
there's a replay of the motor sequence

1105
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,460
that you performed correctly
and there's an elimination

1106
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,420
of the motor sequences that
you performed incorrectly

1107
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,740
and they are run backward in time.

1108
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,550
So to be very clear about
this, if I were to learn

1109
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,900
a new skill or navigate a new city

1110
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,980
or let's just stay with the motor skill,

1111
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,170
let's say the free-throw or a
golf swing or a tennis serve,

1112
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,480
dance move, novice.

1113
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,990
So I'm still going to
make a lot of errors,

1114
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,080
don't get it perfectly,

1115
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,210
but maybe I get a little bit better

1116
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,435
or I perform it correctly
three times out of 1000.

1117
00:50:00,435 --> 00:50:02,130
And it sounds like something I might do

1118
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:04,930
and there I'm probably
being generous to myself.

1119
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,883
After I finished the training session,

1120
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,710
if I do nothing, I'm not focused

1121
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,940
on some additional learning.

1122
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,610
I'm not bringing a lot of
sensory information in.

1123
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,550
If I just sit there and close my eyes

1124
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:21,510
for five to 10 minutes, even one minute,

1125
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,250
the brain starts to
replay the motor sequence

1126
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,160
corresponding to the
correct pattern movement,

1127
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,910
but it plays that sequence backward.

1128
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,330
Now why it plays it
backward, we don't know.

1129
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,320
If I were to wait until
sleep or regardless

1130
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,373
of when I sleep later that night,

1131
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:44,050
the sequence will be replayed forwards

1132
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,423
in the proper sequence.

1133
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,470
Immediately afterward
it's played a backward

1134
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,660
for reasons that are still unclear.

1135
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,670
But the replay of that sequence backwards

1136
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,720
appears to be important
for the consolidation

1137
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,083
of the skill learning.

1138
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,470
Now, this is important because many people

1139
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,090
are finishing their jujitsu class

1140
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,640
or they're finishing their yoga class

1141
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,130
or they're finishing their dance class

1142
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,080
or they're finishing some skill learning

1143
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,280
and then they're immediately
devoting their attention

1144
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,293
to something else.

1145
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,120
You hear a lot about visualization

1146
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,670
and we are going to talk
about visualization.

1147
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,260
But in the kind of obsession with the idea

1148
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,980
that we can learn things,
just sitting there

1149
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,800
with our eyes closed without
having to perform a movement,

1150
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,510
we've overlooked something
perhaps even more important

1151
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,840
or at least equally important,

1152
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,280
which is after skill
learning, after putting effort

1153
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,630
into something, sitting
quietly with the eyes closed

1154
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,730
for one to five to 10
minutes allows the brain

1155
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,490
to replay the sequence in a
way that appears important

1156
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:50,890
for the more rapid consolidation
of the motor sequence

1157
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,620
of the pattern and to
accelerated learning.

1158
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,870
If you'd like to learn more about this,

1159
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,580
this is not work that I was involved in,

1160
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,000
I want to be very clear.

1161
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,040
There's an excellent paper
that covers this and much more

1162
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,522
for those of you that really
want to dive deep on this

1163
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:05,830
and we will dive deeper in a moment.

1164
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,870
This is a review that was
published in the Journal Neuron,

1165
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,063
excellent journal.

1166
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,900
Many of the papers that I'm referring to

1167
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,850
were covered in this
review which is titled,

1168
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:19,650
Neuroplasticity Subserving
Motor Skill Learning by Dayan

1169
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,080
D-A-Y-A-N, I hope I'm not
butchering the pronunciation

1170
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,930
and Cohen, by Leonard Cohen,

1171
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,000
but not the Leonard Cohen
most of us are familiar with,

1172
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,490
the musician, Leonard Cohen.

1173
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,940
Dayan and Cohen, neuroplasticity

1174
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,170
subserving motor skill learning.

1175
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:42,170
And this was published in
2011, but there've been

1176
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,690
a number of updates and the
literature that I've described

1177
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,820
in other portions of today's episode

1178
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,590
come from the more recent literature

1179
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,090
such as the more recent 2021 paper.

1180
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,780
So you have this basic learning session

1181
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,190
and then a period of time afterwards

1182
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,540
in which the brain can
rehearse what it just did.

1183
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,390
We hear so much about mental rehearsal

1184
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,960
and we always think about mental rehearsal

1185
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,760
as the thing you do before you
train or instead of training.

1186
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,990
But this is rehearsal
that's done afterward

1187
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,910
where the brain is just automatically

1188
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,290
scripting through the sequence.

1189
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,270
And for some reason,
that's still not clear

1190
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,830
as to why this would be
the case it runs backward.

1191
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:23,810
Then in sleep, it runs forwards
and certainly absolutely,

1192
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,600
sleep and quality sleep of
the appropriate duration,

1193
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,824
et cetera is going to be important

1194
00:53:28,824 --> 00:53:29,930
for learning of all kinds,
including skill learning.

1195
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,010
We did an entire four episodes on sleep

1196
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,060
and how to get better at sleeping.

1197
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,530
Those are the episodes
back in January episodes,

1198
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,380
essentially one, two, three, and four

1199
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,350
and maybe even episode
five, I don't recall.

1200
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,390
But you can go there to find out

1201
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,880
all about how to get better at sleeping.

1202
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,170
Now there are other
training sessions involved.

1203
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,810
I'm not going to learn
the perfect golf swing

1204
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,790
or the tennis serve or how
to dance in one session

1205
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,350
and I doubt you will either.

1206
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,580
So the question is when to come back

1207
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,160
and what to do when you come
back to the training set.

1208
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,370
Now, first of all, this
principle of errors

1209
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,850
queuing attention and
opening the opportunity

1210
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:14,440
for plasticity, that's
never going to change.

1211
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,270
That's going to be true for
somebody who is hyper skilled

1212
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:22,270
who's even has mastery or even
virtuosity in a given skill.

1213
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,360
Remember, when you're
unskilled at something,

1214
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,610
uncertainty is very high.

1215
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,680
As you become more
skilled, certainty goes up.

1216
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,810
Then eventually you
achieve levels of mastery

1217
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,500
where certainty is very
very high about your ability

1218
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,675
to perform, yours certainty
en that of other people.

1219
00:54:39,675 --> 00:54:42,800
And then there's this fourth
category of virtuosity

1220
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,100
where somebody, maybe
you invites uncertainty

1221
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,260
back into the practice because
only with that uncertainty,

1222
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,740
can you express your
full range of abilities

1223
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,060
which you aren't even aware of

1224
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,263
until uncertainty comes into the picture.

1225
00:54:57,774 --> 00:55:01,140
I happened to have the great privilege

1226
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,520
of being friends with Laird
Hamilton, the big wave surfer

1227
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,430
who's phenomenal.

1228
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,280
I don't surf, I certainly
don't surf with Laird,

1229
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,213
but he, and another guy that
he starts with Luca Patua,

1230
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,280
these guys, they're virtuosos at surfing.

1231
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,320
They don't just want the
wave that they can master,

1232
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,560
they want uncertainty.

1233
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,210
They're at the point in their practice

1234
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,480
where when uncertainty
shows up like a wave

1235
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,480
that's either so big or is
moving in a particular way

1236
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,990
that it brings an element
of uncertainty for them

1237
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,700
about what they're going to
do that they recognize that

1238
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,340
as the opportunity to perform better

1239
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,363
than they would otherwise.

1240
00:55:40,363 --> 00:55:42,410
So they're actually trying
to eliminate uncertainty.

1241
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,884
At the beginning of learning any skill

1242
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,460
and as we approach from
uncertain to skilled to mastery,

1243
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,440
we want to reduce uncertainty.

1244
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,020
And that's really what the
nervous system is doing,

1245
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,070
it's trying to eliminate
errors and hone in

1246
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,033
on the correct trajectories.

1247
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,720
If you perform a lot of repetitions

1248
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,770
and then you use a
period immediately after,

1249
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,000
we don't really have a name for this,

1250
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,200
maybe someone will come up with it

1251
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,430
and put it in the comment section

1252
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,520
if you're on YouTube, if you're
watching this on YouTube,

1253
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,440
a name for this post
learning kind of idle time

1254
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,273
for the brain.

1255
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:15,290
The brain is an idol at
all, it's actually scripting

1256
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:18,350
all these things in reverse
that allow for deeper learning

1257
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,500
and more quick learning.

1258
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,583
But if we fill that with other things,

1259
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,910
if we are focused on our
phones or we're focused

1260
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:27,930
on learning something else,

1261
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,620
we're focusing on our performance,

1262
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,270
that's not going to serve us well,

1263
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:34,110
it's at least it's not going to
serve the skill learning well.

1264
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,490
So please, if you're interested
in more rapid skill learning

1265
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,700
try introducing these sessions,
they can be quite powerful.

1266
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,330
And then on subsequent sessions,

1267
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,230
presumably after a night's sleep

1268
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,710
or maybe you're doing two sessions a day,

1269
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,560
although two sessions a
day is going to be a lot

1270
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,350
for most people, unless
you're a professional

1271
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,350
or a high-level athlete,
the subsequent sessions

1272
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:57,470
are where you get to express the gains

1273
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,970
of the previous session,
where you get to perform well,

1274
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,110
presumably more often
even if it's just subtle.

1275
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,100
Sometimes there'll be a
decrease in performance,

1276
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,820
but most often you're
going to perform better

1277
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,360
on subsequent and subsequent
training sessions.

1278
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,380
And there is the opportunity
to devote attention

1279
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,380
in very specific ways, not
just let the errors inform you

1280
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,410
where to place your attention,
but rather to direct

1281
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,160
your perception to particular
elements of the movement

1282
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,030
in order to accelerate learning further.

1283
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,010
So to be very clear,
'cause I know many of you

1284
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,810
are interested in concrete protocols.

1285
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:41,250
It's not just that you
would only let errors

1286
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,290
cue your attention on the first session.

1287
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,000
You might do that for one
session or five sessions,

1288
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,070
is going to depend.

1289
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,577
But once you're familiar with something

1290
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:51,080
and you're performing it
well every once in a while,

1291
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,750
you're accomplishing it
better every once in a while,

1292
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,470
then you can start to cue your attention

1293
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,460
in very deliberate ways.

1294
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,170
And the question therefore becomes

1295
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,530
what to cue your attention to.

1296
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,623
And the good news is it doesn't matter.

1297
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,520
There is a beautiful set of
experiments that have been done

1298
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,490
looking at sequences of keys
being played on a piano.

1299
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,150
This is work that was published
just a couple of years ago.

1300
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:20,050
There are actually several papers now

1301
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,090
that are focused on this.

1302
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,370
One of them was published in 2018.

1303
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:29,370
This is from Claudia Lappe
and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.

1304
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,940
She's done some really nice
work, which talks about

1305
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,950
the influence of pitch feedback

1306
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,130
on learning of motor
timing and sequencing.

1307
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:37,680
And this was done with piano

1308
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,180
but it carries over to
athletic performance as well.

1309
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,340
So I'm going to describe the study to you,

1310
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:46,560
but before I describe it,
what is so interesting

1311
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,260
about this study that I
want you to know about

1312
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:53,780
is that it turns out it
doesn't matter so much

1313
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,070
what you pay attention to
during the learning sequence

1314
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,920
provided it's something
related to the motor behavior

1315
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,760
that you're performing.

1316
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,310
That seems incredible.

1317
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,440
I'm not good at a tennis serve.

1318
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,000
So if I've done let's say
a thousand repetitions

1319
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,890
of the tennis serve.

1320
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,110
Maybe I got it right three to 10 times.

1321
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,750
Now I'm being even more
generous with myself.

1322
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,110
And I do this post-training session

1323
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,630
where I let my brain idle
and I get some good sleep

1324
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:22,020
and I come back and now I
start generating errors again,

1325
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,780
presumably or hopefully fewer errors,

1326
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,570
but I decide I'm going to cue my attention

1327
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,780
to something very specific,
like maybe how tightly

1328
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,300
I'm holding the racket
or maybe it's my stance,

1329
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,170
or maybe it's whether or not
I rotate my right shoulder in

1330
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,813
as I hit the ball across.

1331
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,260
And I'm making this up,
again I don't play tennis.

1332
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,380
Turns out that it as long
as it's the same thing

1333
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,300
throughout the session,
learning is accelerated.

1334
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,660
And I'll explain why this
make sense in a moment.

1335
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:55,150
But just to be really clear,
you can and one should

1336
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,670
use your powers of attention
to direct your attention

1337
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,400
to particular aspects of a motor movement

1338
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,480
once you're familiar with the
general theme of the movement.

1339
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,580
But what you pay attention
to exactly is not important.

1340
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,100
What's important is that you pay attention

1341
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,070
to one specific thing.

1342
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,070
So what Claudia Lappe
and colleagues showed

1343
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,110
was that if people are trying
to learn a sequence of keys

1344
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:21,510
on the piano, there are
multiple forms of feedback.

1345
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,150
There are error signals if for instance,

1346
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,940
they hear a piece of music
and then they're told

1347
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,459
to press the keys in a particular sequence

1348
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:32,060
and the noise that comes
out, the sound that comes out

1349
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,790
of the piano does not sound
like the song they just heard.

1350
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,830
So instead of, and here, forgive me

1351
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,980
because I'm neither
musical, nor can I sing.

1352
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,550
But instead of dah, dah
dah, dah, they hear that,

1353
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,220
dah, dah dah, dah

1354
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,820
and then instead when they play.

1355
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:51,329
If it were me, it sounds something like,

1356
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:54,150
dah, dah dah [indistinct],
it wouldn't sound right.

1357
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,320
It wouldn't sound right, because
I likely got the sequence

1358
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,210
wrong, or I was pressing
too hard on the keys

1359
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,653
or too lightly on the keys, et cetera.

1360
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,670
What they showed was if
they just instruct people

1361
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,060
about the correct sequence
to press on the keys,

1362
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,520
it actually doesn't matter
what sound comes back,

1363
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:17,520
provided it's the correct
sound or it's the same sound.

1364
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,320
All right, so here's the experiment.

1365
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,060
They had people press on these keys

1366
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,700
and it was a typical
piano and it generated

1367
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,050
the particular sequence of
sounds that would be generated

1368
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,750
by pressing the keys on the piano.

1369
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,090
Or they modified the keyboard
in this case or piano

1370
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:35,860
such that when people pressed on the keys,

1371
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,920
a random tone different tones were played

1372
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,520
each time they pressed on the keys.

1373
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,060
So it sounded crazy,
it sounded like noise,

1374
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,190
but the motor sequence was the same.

1375
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:51,040
Or they had a single tone
that was played every time

1376
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,420
they pressed a key and the
job or the task of the subject

1377
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,310
was just oppressed the keys
in the proper sequence.

1378
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:00,868
So instead of dunt,
dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt,

1379
01:02:00,868 --> 01:02:03,410
it it was just dunt,
dunt, dunt, dunt, dunt.

1380
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,040
Instead of dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,

1381
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,770
it's dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1382
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,120
It's even hard for me to
say it in even a tone,

1383
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,010
but you get the idea.

1384
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:13,960
So a singular tone, just
think a doorbell being rung

1385
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,510
with each press of the key
will be really annoying.

1386
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,790
But it turns out that the
rate to motor learning

1387
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:27,100
was the same, whether or not
they were getting feedback

1388
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,280
that was accurate to the keys of the piano

1389
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,040
or whether or not it was a constant tone.

1390
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,674
Performance was terrible
and the rates of learning

1391
01:02:35,674 --> 01:02:38,180
were terrible if they were
getting random tones back.

1392
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,710
So what this means is that
learning to play the piano

1393
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,520
at least at these early stages

1394
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,270
is really just about
generating the motor commands.

1395
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:49,390
It's not about paying
attention to the sound

1396
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,095
that's coming out of the piano.

1397
01:02:52,095 --> 01:02:54,340
And this makes sense because
when we are beginners,

1398
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,110
we are trying to focus our
attention on the things

1399
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,730
that we can control.

1400
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,710
And if you think about this,
if you conceptualize this,

1401
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,460
pressing the keys on the
piano and paying attention

1402
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,940
to the sounds that are
coming out are two things.

1403
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,260
So what this means is
that as you get deeper

1404
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,460
and deeper into a practice,

1405
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,020
focusing purely on the motor
execution can be beneficial.

1406
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,000
Now, this is going to be harder to do

1407
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,770
with open loop type things
where you're getting feedback.

1408
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,350
I guess a good example of open loop

1409
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,260
would be the attempt at a back flip.

1410
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,360
If you get it wrong, you
will immediately know,

1411
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,210
if you get it right,
you'll immediately know.

1412
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:33,860
Please don't go out and
try and do a back flip

1413
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,890
on the solid ground,
or even on a trampoline

1414
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,330
if you don't know what you're doing

1415
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:39,210
because very likely you'll get it wrong

1416
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,363
and you'll get injured.

1417
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:44,180
But if it's something that is closed loop

1418
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,960
where you can repeat again and
again, and again and again,

1419
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,370
that is advantageous
because you can perform

1420
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:52,980
many many repetitions and
you can start to focus

1421
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,510
or learn to focus your attention

1422
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:57,080
just on the pattern of movement.

1423
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,650
In other words, you can
learn to play the piano

1424
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,480
just as fast or maybe even faster

1425
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,010
by just focusing on the
sequence that you are moving

1426
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:07,780
your digits, your fingers
and not the feedback.

1427
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,670
Now, I'm sure there are
music teachers out there

1428
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,017
and piano teachers that are screaming,

1429
01:04:11,017 --> 01:04:13,067
"No you're going to ruin the practice

1430
01:04:13,067 --> 01:04:15,737
"that all of us have embedded in our minds

1431
01:04:15,737 --> 01:04:17,010
"and in our students."

1432
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:20,810
And I agree, at some
point you need to start

1433
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,130
including feedback about whether or not

1434
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,310
things sound correct.

1435
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,630
But one of the beauties of skill learning

1436
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,080
is that you can choose to parameterize it,

1437
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,950
meaning you can choose to just
focus on the motor sequence

1438
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,470
or just focus on the
sounds that are coming back

1439
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,540
and then integrate those.

1440
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,840
And so we hear a lot about chunking,

1441
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,500
about breaking things down
into their component parts.

1442
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,620
But one of the biggest
challenges for skill learning

1443
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,800
is knowing where to place your attention.

1444
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,234
So to dial out again,
we're building a protocol

1445
01:04:49,234 --> 01:04:50,850
across this episode, early sessions,

1446
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,930
maybe it's the first one,
maybe it's the first 10,

1447
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,540
maybe it's the first 100.

1448
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,250
It depends on how many
repetitions you're packing in.

1449
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,030
But during those initial sessions,

1450
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:02,730
the key is to make many errors
to let the reward process

1451
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:06,920
govern the plasticity, let the
errors open the plasticity.

1452
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,950
And then after the learning sessions,

1453
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,960
to let the brain go idle

1454
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,270
at least for a short period of time

1455
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,820
and of course, to maximize sleep.

1456
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,910
As you start incorporating more sessions,

1457
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:19,820
you start to gain some skill level,

1458
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,050
learning to harness and
focus your attention

1459
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,370
on particular features of the movement

1460
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:28,900
independent of the
rewards and the feedback.

1461
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,460
So the reward is no longer in
the tone coming from the piano

1462
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,380
or whether or not you
struck the target correctly

1463
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,150
but simply the motor
movement focusing your,

1464
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:41,380
for instance in a dart throw,
on the action of your arm.

1465
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,750
That is embedding the
plasticity in the motor pattern

1466
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,640
most deeply, that's what's been shown

1467
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,060
by the scientific literature.

1468
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,970
I'm sure there are coaches
and teachers out there

1469
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:52,850
that will entirely disagree
with me and that's great.

1470
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:55,020
Please let me know what you prefer,

1471
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,730
let me know where you think this is wrong

1472
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,310
and it rarely happens, but
let me know where you think

1473
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,870
this might be right as well.

1474
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,730
So we're breaking the
learning process down

1475
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,400
into its component parts.

1476
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,090
As we get more and more skilled,

1477
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,570
meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors

1478
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:14,570
per a given session per unit
time, that's when attention

1479
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,510
can start to migrate from one feature

1480
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,620
such as the motor sequence
to another feature

1481
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:25,620
which is perhaps one's
stance and another sequence,

1482
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,080
component of the sequence,
which would be the result

1483
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,010
that's one getting on
a trial to trial basis.

1484
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:33,030
So changing it up each time.

1485
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,270
So maybe I served the tennis ball

1486
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,620
and I'm focusing on where the ball lands

1487
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,160
and then I'm focusing on the speed,

1488
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,630
then I'm focusing on my grip,
then I'm focusing on my stance

1489
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,930
from trial to trial.

1490
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,140
But until we've mastered
the core motor movements

1491
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:49,350
which has done session to session,

1492
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,310
that at least according to the literature

1493
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:55,250
that I have access to here,
seems to be suboptimal.

1494
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,590
So hopefully this is
starting to make sense,

1495
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:01,410
which is that these connections
between upper motor neurons,

1496
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:04,240
lower motor neurons and
central pattern generators,

1497
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,080
you can't attack them all at once.

1498
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,094
You can't try and change them all at once.

1499
01:07:08,094 --> 01:07:09,210
And so what we're doing is
we're breaking things down

1500
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,320
into their component parts.

1501
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,523
Some of you may be wondering
about speed of movement.

1502
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,640
There are some data, meaning
some decent papers out there

1503
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,060
showing that ultra slow movements,

1504
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:26,050
performing a movement
essentially in slow motion

1505
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:31,050
can be beneficial for enhancing
the rate of skill learning.

1506
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:35,030
However, at least from my
read of the literature,

1507
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:38,090
it appears that ultra slow
movements should be performed

1508
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:42,560
after some degree of proficiency
has already been gained

1509
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,290
in that particular movement.

1510
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:46,080
Now that's not the way I
would have thought about it.

1511
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,480
I would have thought, well,
if you're learning how to do

1512
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,730
a proper kick or a paunch in martial arts

1513
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:53,180
or something that ultra
slow movements at first

1514
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:57,880
are going to be the way
that one can best learn

1515
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,040
how to perform a movement

1516
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,060
and then you just gradually
increase the speed.

1517
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,660
It turns out that's not the case

1518
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,410
and I probably should have known that.

1519
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:08,560
And you should probably know
that because it turns out

1520
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,440
that when you do ultra slow movements,

1521
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,410
two things aren't available to you.

1522
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:16,069
One is the proprioceptive
feedback is not accurate

1523
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:18,879
because of fast movements
of limbs are very different

1524
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,810
than slow movements of limbs.

1525
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:21,920
So you don't get the opportunity

1526
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,460
to build in the proprioceptive feedback.

1527
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,160
But the other reason why it doesn't work

1528
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,470
is that it's too accurate,
you don't generate errors.

1529
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,130
And so the data that I was able to find

1530
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:38,000
show that very slow
movements can be beneficial

1531
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,830
if one is already
proficient in a practice,

1532
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,130
but very slow movements at the beginning

1533
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,399
don't allow you to learn more quickly

1534
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:47,059
because you never generate errors

1535
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,779
and therefore the brain doesn't,
it's not open for change.

1536
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:54,669
The window for plasticity has
never swung open, so to speak.

1537
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,970
So it brings us back to this theme

1538
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,149
that errors allow for plasticity,

1539
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:00,839
correct performance of movements

1540
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,149
or semi correct performance of
movements, cues the synapses

1541
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:08,569
in the brain areas and spinal
circuits that need to change.

1542
01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:10,579
And then those changes occur in the period

1543
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,859
immediately after skill
learning and in sleep.

1544
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,659
So super slow movements can be beneficial

1545
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,569
once you already have some proficiencies.

1546
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:21,129
So this might be standing
in your living room

1547
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:23,279
and just in ultra slow motion,

1548
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,329
performing your tennis serve, learning to,

1549
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:27,420
or thinking about how
you're adjusting your elbow

1550
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,960
and your arm and the trajectory
exactly how you were taught

1551
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,340
by your tennis coach.

1552
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,300
But trying to learn it
that way from the outset

1553
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,979
does not appear to be the
best way to learn a skill.

1554
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,249
When should you start to
introduce slow learning?

1555
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,680
Well, obviously talk to
your coaches about this,

1556
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,569
but if you're doing this recreationally

1557
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:46,889
or you don't have a coach,
I realize many of you don't.

1558
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,200
I don't have a coach
for anything that I do.

1559
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,350
I'm going to have just navigating it

1560
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,660
by using the scientific literature.

1561
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,850
It appears that once you're
hitting success rates

1562
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:00,830
of about 25 or 30%, that's
where the super slow movements

1563
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,610
can start to be beneficial.

1564
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:05,750
But if you're still
performing things at a rate

1565
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,200
of five or 10% correct
and the rest are errors,

1566
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,440
then the super slow movements

1567
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,210
are probably not going
to benefit you that much.

1568
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:16,270
Also super slow movements
are not really applicable

1569
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,060
to a lot of things.

1570
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,170
For instance, you could
imagine throwing a dart

1571
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:23,270
super slow motion, but if you actually try

1572
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,640
and throw an actual dart,

1573
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,230
the dart's just going to
fall to the floor, obviously.

1574
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:30,300
So there are a number of
things like baseball bat swing

1575
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,850
which you can practice
in super slow motion.

1576
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,910
But if you try and do that
with an actual baseball

1577
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,466
or softball or something like that,

1578
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:38,550
that's not going to give
you any kind of feedback

1579
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,970
about how effective it was.

1580
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:44,480
So super slow movements
or a decelerated movement

1581
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:49,230
has its place but once you're
already performing things

1582
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:53,020
reasonably well like maybe
25 to 30% success rate.

1583
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,640
And I've tried this, I actually,
I struggle with basketball

1584
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,180
for whatever reason and
my free throw is terrible.

1585
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:02,310
So I practiced free throws
in super slow motion

1586
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:04,250
and I nailed them every time,

1587
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,310
the problem is there's no ball.

1588
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:09,320
Some of you already have a
fair degree of proficiency,

1589
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:14,320
of skill in a given practice
or sport or instrument.

1590
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:18,150
And if you're in this sort
of advanced intermediate

1591
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,680
or advanced levels of
proficiency for something,

1592
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,050
there is a practice that you
can find interesting data for

1593
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,700
in the literature, which
involves metronoming.

1594
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:35,700
So this you'll realize relates
to generating repetitions

1595
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:39,180
and it relates to the tone experiment

1596
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,970
where it doesn't really
matter what your attention

1597
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,960
is cued to as long as you are performing

1598
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,850
many many reps of the motor sequence.

1599
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,960
You can use a metronome and
obviously musicians do this,

1600
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,340
but athletes can do this too.

1601
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,870
You can use a metronome to set the cadence

1602
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,790
of your repetitions.

1603
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:01,066
Now for swimmers, there's
actually a device.

1604
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:01,899
I was able to find online,

1605
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:02,750
I forgot what the brand name was

1606
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,620
and that's not what this is
about, but that actually goes

1607
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:08,110
in the swim cap that can cue you

1608
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:10,180
to when you need to
perform another stroke.

1609
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:14,180
And for runners, there are
other metronome type devices

1610
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,930
that through headphones or
through a tone in the room

1611
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:19,000
if you're running
indoors or on a treadmill

1612
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,750
we'll cue you to when you basically

1613
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,453
you need to lift your heels.

1614
01:12:22,453 --> 01:12:24,140
And if you do that, what athletes find

1615
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,360
is they can perform more repetitions,

1616
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:29,610
they can generate more output,
you can increase speed.

1617
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:31,270
A number of really interesting
things are being done

1618
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,457
with auditory metronoming.

1619
01:12:33,457 --> 01:12:34,760
And then I'm involved in
a little bit of work now

1620
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,900
that hopefully I'll be
able to report back to you

1621
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,330
about using stroboscopic metronoming.

1622
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:42,050
So actually changing the speed
of the visual environment.

1623
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,640
These are fun experiments,
basically changing

1624
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,130
one's perception of how fast
they're moving through space

1625
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,010
by playing with the visual system,

1626
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:50,740
something for a future discussion.

1627
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:53,670
But you can start to
use auditory metronoming

1628
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:57,570
for generating more
movements per unit time

1629
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,830
and generating more errors
and therefore more successes

1630
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:02,670
and more neuroplasticity.

1631
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,890
There are a number of
different apps out there.

1632
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,090
I found several free
apps where you can set in

1633
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:08,920
a metronome pace, or
it might be tick, tick,

1634
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,330
tick, tick, tick, tick.

1635
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:11,810
That's a little fast for most things,

1636
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:14,320
but you can imagine if this were darts

1637
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,410
or this were golf swings
that it might be tick,

1638
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:20,960
tick, tick, tick or something
more like tick, tick.

1639
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,330
And every time the
metronome goes, you swing.

1640
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,660
Every time the metronome
goes, you throw a dart.

1641
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,220
Actually there's some wild
experiments out there.

1642
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,910
You know there's a world
championship of cup stacking.

1643
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:33,140
There's a young lady who I
saw could take all these cups

1644
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,330
spread out on a table and
basically just stack them

1645
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:37,527
into the perfect pyramid in
the least amount of times

1646
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:38,550
and all the kids go wild.

1647
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:41,010
This is something I'd
never thought to pursue

1648
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,320
and frankly never will pursue

1649
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,960
unless my life depends
on it for some reason,

1650
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,300
but it's really impressive.

1651
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,120
And if you look at the sequence

1652
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,290
'cause these have been recorded,

1653
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,610
you can look this up on YouTube.

1654
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:54,630
What you'll find is that
these expert cup stackers,

1655
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,910
it's just all about error elimination.

1656
01:13:56,910 --> 01:14:00,070
But they're two metronomic
and auditory cues

1657
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:02,680
can actually cue them to
pick up the cups faster

1658
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,480
than they would ordinarily
and to learn to do that.

1659
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,530
You can do this for anything.

1660
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,960
I think cup stacking
is probably not a skill

1661
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,110
most of you are interested in doing,

1662
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:15,110
but for any skill, if you
figure out at what rate

1663
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:17,590
you are performing
repetitions per unit time

1664
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,280
and you want to increase that slightly,

1665
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,430
you set a metronome
which is slightly faster

1666
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:24,520
than your current rate and
you just start generating

1667
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,370
more repetitions.

1668
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,950
Now what's interesting
about this and is cool

1669
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:30,730
is it relates back to the experiment

1670
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:34,980
from Lappe and colleagues,
which is your attention

1671
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:39,440
is now harnessed to the
tone, to the metronome,

1672
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,000
not necessarily to what you're doing

1673
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,198
in terms of the motor movement.

1674
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:44,960
And so really you need
a bit of proficiency.

1675
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,150
Again, this is for people
who are in intermediate

1676
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:49,120
or advanced intermediate or advanced.

1677
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,540
But what you're essentially
doing is you're creating

1678
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:55,310
an outside pressure, a
contingency so that you generate,

1679
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:56,720
again, more errors.

1680
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,750
So it's all about the errors that you get.

1681
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,690
Now, these aren't errors
where all the cups tumble

1682
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,700
or you have to stop or you can't keep up,

1683
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,490
you have to set the pace just a little bit

1684
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,970
beyond what you currently can do.

1685
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,030
And when you do that,
you're essentially forcing

1686
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,180
the nervous system to make
errors and correct the errors

1687
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,760
inside of the session.

1688
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,930
I find this really interesting
because what it means

1689
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:17,170
is, again you've got sensory perception,

1690
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,100
what you're paying attention to,

1691
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,840
proprioception where your
limbs are and the motor neurons

1692
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,940
in your upper lower motor neurons

1693
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,880
and central pattern generators.

1694
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,267
And you can't pay attention to,

1695
01:15:26,267 --> 01:15:27,777
"Well, they're my upper motor neurons,

1696
01:15:27,777 --> 01:15:28,810
"they're my lower motor neurons."

1697
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:31,321
Forget that, you're not going to do that.

1698
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:33,890
You can't pay attention to
your proprioception too much.

1699
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,550
That would be the super slow motion

1700
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:37,530
would be the proprioception.

1701
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:41,350
But you have to harness
your attention to something.

1702
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,500
And if you harness your attention

1703
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,680
to this outside
contingency, this metronome

1704
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,610
that's firing off and saying,
now go, now go, now go.

1705
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,520
Not only can you increase the
number of repetitions, errors

1706
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,850
and successes, but for some
reason and we don't know why,

1707
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:59,320
the regular cadence of
the tone of the metronome

1708
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:02,720
and the fact that you are
anchoring your movements

1709
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,190
to some external force,
to some external pressure

1710
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:10,420
or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity

1711
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,960
and the changes and the
acquisition of skills

1712
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,160
beyond what it would be if
you just did the same number

1713
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,740
of repetitions without
that outside pressure.

1714
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,420
We don't know exactly
what the mechanism is.

1715
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,230
Presumably it's neurochemical,
like there's something

1716
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:25,410
about keeping up with
a timer or with a pace

1717
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:28,160
that presumably and I'm speculating here,

1718
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,480
causes the release of
particular chemicals.

1719
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,950
But I think it's really cool.

1720
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:34,220
Metronomes, they're totally inexpensive,

1721
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,460
at least the ones that
you use outside of water

1722
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,490
are very inexpensive.

1723
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:39,220
You can find these free apps,

1724
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,840
you can use a musical metronome.

1725
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,930
So metronomes are a powerful tool as well

1726
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,630
in particular for speed work.

1727
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,970
So for sprinting or swimming or running

1728
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:52,100
where the goal is to generate more strokes

1729
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:55,860
or more efficient strokes
or more steps, et cetera.

1730
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,450
The rate of the metronome obviously

1731
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,300
is going to be very important.

1732
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,950
Sometimes you're trying
to lengthen your stride,

1733
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,930
sometimes you're trying
to take fewer strokes

1734
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:05,480
but glide further in
the pool for instance.

1735
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,730
But the value of occasionally

1736
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:11,690
just the number of repetitions,
the number of strokes

1737
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,340
or steps, et cetera per unit time is also

1738
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,270
that you're training the
central pattern generators

1739
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:18,573
to operate at that higher speed.

1740
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,280
One of the sports has
kind of interesting to me

1741
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,400
is speed walking.

1742
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,610
It's not one I engage in or
ever planned to engage in,

1743
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:27,990
but if you've ever tried
to really speed walk,

1744
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,160
it's actually difficult
to walk very very fast

1745
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,750
without breaking into a run.

1746
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,200
All animals have these
kinds of crossover points

1747
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,770
where you go.

1748
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:39,680
I think with horses it's
like it was that they trot,

1749
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,000
then they gallop on, or
what's the next thing.

1750
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,240
Clearly, I don't know
anything about horses

1751
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,750
except that they're beautiful
and I liked them very much.

1752
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:51,010
But they break into a
different kind of stride.

1753
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:52,290
And that's because you shift over

1754
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,090
to different central pattern generators.

1755
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:57,950
So when you're walking or a
horse is moving very slowly

1756
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:00,452
and then it breaks into a jog

1757
01:18:00,452 --> 01:18:03,790
and then into a full sprint
or gallop for the horse,

1758
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:04,970
you're actually engaging different

1759
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,393
central pattern generators.

1760
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,110
And those central pattern generators

1761
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,940
always have a range of
speeds that they're happiest

1762
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,050
to function at.

1763
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:16,163
So with the metronoming
for speed purposes,

1764
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:19,050
what you do is you can
basically bring the activity

1765
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,350
of those central pattern generators

1766
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:24,828
into their upper range and
maybe even extend their range.

1767
01:18:24,828 --> 01:18:25,720
And there's a fascinating biology

1768
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,934
of how central pattern
generators work together.

1769
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:30,820
There's coupling of central
pattern generators, et cetera

1770
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:34,333
in order to achieve maximum
speeds and et cetera.

1771
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:35,770
It's a topic for a kind
of an advanced session.

1772
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,983
Costa loves this topic, he just barked.

1773
01:18:39,418 --> 01:18:40,570
And he loves it so much, he barked again.

1774
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:43,060
In any event, the metronome
is a powerful tool,

1775
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,200
again for more advanced practitioners

1776
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,350
or for advanced
intermediate practitioners.

1777
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:51,560
But it's interesting
because it brings back

1778
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,270
the point that what we
put our attention to

1779
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:57,170
while we're still learning is important

1780
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,460
to the extent that it's on one thing

1781
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,110
at least for the moment or trial to trial,

1782
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:07,110
but that what we focus our
attention on can be external,

1783
01:19:08,383 --> 01:19:10,420
it can be internal and
ultimately the skill learning

1784
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,640
is where all that is brought together.

1785
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,120
So let's talk about where
skill learning occurs

1786
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,896
in the nervous system.

1787
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:19,310
And then I'm going to give you a really,

1788
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:22,520
what I think is a really cool tool

1789
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,170
that can increase flexibility
and range of motion

1790
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:27,860
based on this particular brain area.

1791
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:30,110
It's a tool that I used and
when I first heard about,

1792
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:32,140
I did not believe would work.

1793
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,380
This is not a hack, this
is actually anchored deeply

1794
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,670
in the biology of a particular
brain region that we all have

1795
01:19:39,278 --> 01:19:40,890
whose meaning is mini brain.

1796
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:43,430
And that mini brain that we all have

1797
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,320
is called your cerebellum.

1798
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,100
The cerebellum is called the mini brain

1799
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,209
because it's in the back of your brain.

1800
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:50,042
It looks like a little mini version

1801
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:50,940
of the rest of your brain.

1802
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:53,520
It's an absolutely incredible structure

1803
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,960
that's involved in movement.

1804
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,323
It also has a lot of non-movement
associated functions.

1805
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,920
In brief, the cerebellum
gets input from your senses,

1806
01:20:07,685 --> 01:20:09,600
particularly, your eyes and pays attention

1807
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,450
to where your eyes are in
space, what you're looking at.

1808
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:16,280
It basically takes information
about three aspects

1809
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:21,240
of your eyes and eye
movements which are occurring

1810
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,060
when your head goes like
this, which is called pitch.

1811
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,173
So this is pitch.

1812
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,000
For those of you that are
listening I'm just nodding

1813
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,630
up and down then there's yaw,

1814
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:34,430
which is like shaking your
head, no, from side to side.

1815
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,460
And then there's roll,
which is that like sometimes

1816
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,563
if you see a primate, like
a Marmoset or something,

1817
01:20:41,426 --> 01:20:42,730
they will roll their head
when they look at you.

1818
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:45,070
Actually, the reason they
do that is it helps generate

1819
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,770
depth perception, it's a kind
of form of motion parallax

1820
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,120
if you're curious why they do that.

1821
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,490
It's not to look cute, they do
it because when they do that,

1822
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:54,540
even if you're stationary
and they're stationary,

1823
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:56,270
they get better depth perception

1824
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:59,900
as to how far away from them you are.

1825
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,180
So you've got pitch, yaw and roll.

1826
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,550
And as you move your head
and as you move your body

1827
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:10,420
and you move through space,
the image on your retina moves,

1828
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:12,200
pitch, yaw on roll in some combination,

1829
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,480
that information is
relayed to your cerebellum.

1830
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,820
So it's rich with visual information.

1831
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,810
There's also a map of your body surface

1832
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:22,680
and your movements and
timing in the cerebellum.

1833
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,690
So it's an incredible
structure that brings together

1834
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:28,035
timing of movements,
which limbs are moving

1835
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:30,700
and has proprioceptive information.

1836
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,610
It really is a mini brain,

1837
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:34,820
it's just the coolest
little structure back there.

1838
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,440
And in humans, it's
actually not that little,

1839
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,750
it's just an incredible structure.

1840
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,870
Now, all this information
is integrated there,

1841
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:46,840
but what most people don't tell
us is that a lot of learning

1842
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,710
of motor sequences of skill
learning that involves timing

1843
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,263
occurs in the cerebellum.

1844
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:55,160
Now, you can't really use that information

1845
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,630
except to know that after you
learn something pretty well,

1846
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:00,820
it's handed off or kind of
handled by your cerebellum,

1847
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,710
but there is something that
you can do with your cerebellum

1848
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:05,720
to increase range of
motion and flexibility.

1849
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,850
Much of our flexibility, believe it or not

1850
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:12,500
is not because our tendons
are particular length

1851
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,530
or a elasticity, although
that plays some role,

1852
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,600
it's not because our muscles are short.

1853
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,030
I don't know what that would even mean.

1854
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:22,150
Some people have longer muscle bellies

1855
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:25,330
or shorter muscle bellies,
but your muscles always

1856
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:29,140
essentially span the
entire length of the bone

1857
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:32,520
or limb or close to it,
along with your tendons.

1858
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:36,930
But has to do with the
neural innervation of muscle

1859
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:39,240
and the fact that when
muscles are elongated,

1860
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,960
there's a point at which
they won't stretch out

1861
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,680
any longer and the nerves
fire, and they shut down

1862
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,260
that you actually have inhibitory pathways

1863
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,160
that prevent you from
contracting the muscles

1864
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,000
or from extending them, from
stretching them out any more.

1865
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,530
So you can do this right now.

1866
01:22:57,530 --> 01:23:00,573
If you're driving, don't do
it because unless you have

1867
01:23:00,573 --> 01:23:02,251
a self-driving car, you'll
need to take your hands

1868
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:03,084
off the steering.

1869
01:23:03,084 --> 01:23:08,084
But because of the way that
vision and your muscles

1870
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,730
are represented in your cerebellum,

1871
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:17,430
it turns out that your
range of visual motion

1872
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:22,390
and your range of vision,
literally how wide a field of view

1873
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:27,390
you take impacts how far
you can extend your limbs.

1874
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:29,770
So we'll talk about this in a second

1875
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,610
exactly how to do this and explore this.

1876
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:37,940
But as you move through
space, as you walk forward

1877
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,830
or you walk backward,
or you tilt your head

1878
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:42,780
or you learn a skill, or you
just operate in the normal ways

1879
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,290
throughout your day,
driving, biking, et cetera,

1880
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:47,360
your eyes are generating
spontaneous movements

1881
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,560
to offset visual slip.

1882
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,720
In other words, you don't
see the world as blurry

1883
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,850
even though you're
moving because your eyes

1884
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,840
are generating low
compensatory eye movements

1885
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,140
to offset your motion.

1886
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,400
So if I spin, we could do this experiment.

1887
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,270
There's a fun experiment
we do with medical students

1888
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:05,660
where you spin them around in
a chair with their eyes closed

1889
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:08,430
and then you stop and you
have them open their eyes

1890
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:11,420
and their eyes are going
like this, is nystagmus.

1891
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,750
I don't suggest you do this experiment.

1892
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,090
When we were kids, we did
a different experiment

1893
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:18,780
which was to take a stick
and to look at the top

1894
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,400
of the stick and to
spin around on the lawn

1895
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,030
looking at the top of the
stick then put it down

1896
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,370
on the ground and try and jump over it.

1897
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:25,730
And you ended up like jumping to the side,

1898
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:27,460
you miss the thing entirely.

1899
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:32,410
The reason those two "experiments"
which I hope you don't do

1900
01:24:33,847 --> 01:24:34,700
or for somebody else to do.

1901
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,430
The reason they work is because
normally your eye movements

1902
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:41,030
and your balance and your limb
movements are coordinated.

1903
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:43,630
But when you spin around
looking up at the stick,

1904
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,350
what you're doing is
you're fixating your eyes

1905
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,480
on one location while you're moving.

1906
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,910
And then when you stop
those two mechanisms

1907
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:53,180
are completely uncoupled
and it's like being thrown

1908
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,313
into outer space.

1909
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:56,565
I've never been to outer space,

1910
01:24:56,565 --> 01:24:59,103
but probably something like
that, low gravity, zero gravity.

1911
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,860
If you spin around in your
chair with your eyes closed,

1912
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:05,090
you're not giving the visual
input that you're spinning.

1913
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:08,110
And then you open the eyes
and then the eyes only have

1914
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,808
what we call the vestibular,
your eyes jolting

1915
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,897
back and forth, back and forth.

1916
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:13,990
Again, these aren't
experiments you need to do

1917
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:16,060
'cause I just told you the result.

1918
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,980
However, if you want to
extend your range of motion,

1919
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,370
you can do that by...

1920
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:24,510
These things always look
goofy, but at this point

1921
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:26,630
I'm just kind of used
to doing these things.

1922
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:28,450
If I want to extend my range of movement,

1923
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,053
first, I want to measure
my range of motion.

1924
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,690
If you're listening what I'm
doing is I'm stretching out

1925
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:37,550
my arms like a T on either side

1926
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,350
and I'm trying to push
them as far back as I can,

1927
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:43,070
which for me feels like it's
in line with my shoulders

1928
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:44,040
and I can't get much further.

1929
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,810
I'm not really super flexible

1930
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:50,803
nor am I particularly
inflexible at least physically.

1931
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,390
So what I would then do is stop.

1932
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:57,440
I would move my eyes to the far periphery.

1933
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,540
So I'm moving my eyes
all the way to the left

1934
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,130
while keeping my head and body stationary.

1935
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:05,810
I'm trying to look over my
left shoulder as far as I can

1936
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:07,920
then off to the right.

1937
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,450
It's a little awkward to
do this, then up then down

1938
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:14,640
but I'm mostly going to just focus on left

1939
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,840
and then right.

1940
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,530
Now what that's doing
is it's sending a signal

1941
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:22,960
to my cerebellum that my field
of view is way over to there

1942
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,450
and way over to there.

1943
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:26,760
Remember your visual
attention has an aperture.

1944
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,840
It can be narrow, or it can be broad.

1945
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,100
And I've talked about some of the benefits

1946
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,680
of taking a broad visual aperture

1947
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,440
in order to relax the nervous system.

1948
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,700
This is just moving my eyes, not my head,

1949
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,880
like I just did for a
second, from side to side.

1950
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,320
Now I can retest.

1951
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:43,210
And actually you get about
a five to 15 degree increase

1952
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:44,660
in your range of motion.

1953
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,466
Now I'm doing this for you.

1954
01:26:46,466 --> 01:26:47,717
You can say, "Well, he
gamed it 'cause he knew

1955
01:26:47,717 --> 01:26:49,570
"the result that he was hoping for."

1956
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,160
But you can try this.

1957
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,710
And you can do this for legs too.

1958
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:55,450
You can do this for any limb essentially.

1959
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:58,196
And that's it's purely cerebellar.

1960
01:26:58,196 --> 01:27:01,300
And it's because the proprioceptive visual

1961
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:04,820
and limb movement feedback converge

1962
01:27:05,681 --> 01:27:08,390
in the ways that we
control our muscle spindles

1963
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,750
and the way we control the
muscle fibers and the tendons

1964
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,604
and essentially you can
get bigger range of motion.

1965
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,170
So actually we'll warm up before exercise

1966
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:18,260
or before skill learning by
both doing movements for my body

1967
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,290
but also moving my eyes from side to side

1968
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:22,450
in order to generate
larger range of motion

1969
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,850
if range of motion is something
that I'm interested in.

1970
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:28,280
So that's a fun one that you
can play with a little bit

1971
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,820
and it's purely cerebellar.

1972
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:33,110
Some other time we'll get back
into a cerebellar function.

1973
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,510
There's all sorts of just incredible stuff

1974
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:37,250
that you can do with cerebellum.

1975
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,930
I talked in an earlier
episode on neuro-plasticity

1976
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:44,180
about how you can disrupt
your vestibular world.

1977
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:49,180
In other words, by getting
into modes of acceleration,

1978
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:52,283
moving through space where
you're tilted in certain ways,

1979
01:27:53,283 --> 01:27:54,980
it can open up the windows for plasticity

1980
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,330
and yet other ways.

1981
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:59,150
So you can check that out, it's
one of the earlier episodes

1982
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:01,600
on neuroplasticity
everything's timestamped.

1983
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,360
But meanwhile, if you want to
expand your range of motion

1984
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,520
before doing skill learning or
afterward, this is a fun one.

1985
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,060
It's also kind of neat because
I have this kind of aversion

1986
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,240
to stretching work.

1987
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,210
It never seems like something I want to do

1988
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,740
and so I always put it off.

1989
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:19,650
So if I start with the
visual practice of expanding

1990
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:22,200
my field of view to off to
one side or the other side

1991
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,680
or up or down, then what
I find is I'm naturally

1992
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,513
more flexible.

1993
01:28:25,513 --> 01:28:26,760
I'm not naturally more flexible.

1994
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,570
What's happened is I've
expanded my range of motion.

1995
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:33,253
Let's talk about visualization
and mental rehearsal.

1996
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:35,680
I've been asked about this a lot,

1997
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,180
and I think it relates
back to that kind of matrix

1998
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:43,130
Hollywood idea that we can
just be embedded with a skill.

1999
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:45,280
Although in this case, in fairness,

2000
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,700
visualization involves some work.

2001
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:50,310
And I've talked about
this on an earlier episode

2002
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:53,040
that some people find it very hard

2003
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,130
to mentally visualize things.

2004
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,790
And some people find it very easy.

2005
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,660
There was great work that
was done in the 1960s

2006
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,960
by Roger Shepherd at
Stanford and by others,

2007
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,930
looking at people's ability to rotate

2008
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:10,310
three-dimensional objects in their mind.

2009
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:12,176
And some people really good at this

2010
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:13,009
and some people are less good at this.

2011
01:29:13,009 --> 01:29:16,340
And one can get better
at it by repeating it.

2012
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:18,130
But the question we're
going to deal with today

2013
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:22,293
is does it help, does it
let you learn things faster?

2014
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:26,780
And indeed the answer
appears to be yes, it can.

2015
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:31,440
However, despite what you've
heard, it is not as good.

2016
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,840
It is not a total replacement

2017
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,423
for physical performance itself.

2018
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,910
So I'm going to be really
concrete about this.

2019
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:43,610
I hear all the time that just imagining

2020
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:46,490
contracting a muscle can
lead to the same gains

2021
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:48,500
as actually contracting that muscle.

2022
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,890
Just imagining a skill can
lead to the same increases

2023
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:55,370
in performance as actually
executing that skill.

2024
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,780
And that's simply not the case.

2025
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:02,360
However, it can supplement
or support physical training

2026
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,390
and skill learning in ways
that are quite powerful.

2027
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:07,430
One of the more
interesting studies on this

2028
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:10,990
was from Rang Ganason at all,

2029
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,853
forgive me for the pronunciation.

2030
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:17,180
This was a slightly older paper, 2004,

2031
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,310
but nonetheless was one that I thought

2032
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:21,270
had particularly impressive results

2033
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:25,440
and included all the
appropriate controls, et cetera.

2034
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,030
And what they did is they
looked at 30 subjects.

2035
01:30:28,030 --> 01:30:30,460
They divide them into different groups.

2036
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:34,480
They had one group perform
essentially finger flection.

2037
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,830
So it actually sort of the
imagine if you're just listening

2038
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:39,303
to this, the come here a finger movement.

2039
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:45,020
They also had elbow flection,
so bicep curl type movement.

2040
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:49,960
And they either had subjects
do a actual physical movement

2041
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,690
against resistance, or to
imagine moving their finger

2042
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:56,010
or their wrist towards the shoulder,

2043
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:58,010
meaning at the bending at the elbow

2044
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,793
towards actual resistance.

2045
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,330
Just to make a long story short,

2046
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:07,000
what they found was that
there were increases

2047
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,870
in this finger, adduction
strength, abduction,

2048
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:14,550
excuse me, strength of about
35% and the elbow flection

2049
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:19,550
strength by about 13.5%,
which are pretty impressive

2050
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:23,081
considering that was just done mentally.

2051
01:31:23,081 --> 01:31:25,631
So they had people imagine
moving against a weight,

2052
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:30,490
a very heavyweight or had
imagined people moving their wrist

2053
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,520
towards their shoulder
against a very heavyweight.

2054
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,780
But again, they weren't doing it,

2055
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,243
they were just imagining it.

2056
01:31:37,388 --> 01:31:39,490
Other experiments looked at the brain

2057
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:42,020
and what was happening in
the brain during this time.

2058
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:44,110
So we'll talk about that in a moment.

2059
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:47,880
But essentially what they
found were improvements

2060
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:52,880
in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.

2061
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:56,530
However, the actual
physical training group,

2062
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:59,080
the groups that actually moved their wrist

2063
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:02,560
or moved their finger against
an actual physical weight

2064
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,340
had improvements of about 53%.

2065
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,010
So this repeats over and over
throughout the literature

2066
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:13,150
mental rehearsal can cause
increases in strength.

2067
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:18,150
It can create increases in
skill acquisition and learning,

2068
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:22,430
but they are never as great if done alone

2069
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:26,930
as compared to the
actual physical execution

2070
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:28,710
of those movements or
the physical movement

2071
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:32,160
of those weights, which
shouldn't come as so surprising.

2072
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,127
However, if we step back and we say,

2073
01:32:34,127 --> 01:32:37,680
"Well, what is the source
of this improvement?"

2074
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,786
You might not care what the source is

2075
01:32:39,786 --> 01:32:41,535
because I could tell
you it's one brain area

2076
01:32:41,535 --> 01:32:42,627
or another brain area.

2077
01:32:42,627 --> 01:32:43,484
What difference would it make?

2078
01:32:43,484 --> 01:32:45,460
But again, if you can understand
mechanism a little bit,

2079
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,960
you're in a position to create newer

2080
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,960
and even better protocols.

2081
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,300
What mental rehearsal appears
to do is engage the activity

2082
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,470
of those upper motor
neurons that we talked about

2083
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:58,810
way back at the beginning of the episode.

2084
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:00,260
Remember you have upper motor neurons

2085
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:01,890
that control deliberate action,

2086
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:03,720
you've got lower motor
neurons that actually

2087
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,440
connect to the muscles
and move those muscles

2088
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,340
and you have central pattern generators.

2089
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:10,200
Mental rehearsal, closing
one's eyes typically

2090
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,250
and thinking about a
particular sequence of movement

2091
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:18,250
and visualizing it in one's "mind's eye"

2092
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,380
creates activation of
the upper motor neurons

2093
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:25,750
that's very similar if not the
same as the actual movement.

2094
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,050
And that makes sense because
the upper motor neurons

2095
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:30,310
are all about the command for movement.

2096
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,160
They are not the ones that
actually execute the movement.

2097
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,990
Remember, upper motor neurons are the ones

2098
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,610
that generate the command for movement,

2099
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:38,990
not the actual movement.

2100
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:40,630
The ones that generate the actual movement

2101
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:41,840
are the lower motor neurons

2102
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,960
and the central pattern generators.

2103
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,570
So visualization is a powerful tool.

2104
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:48,680
How can you use visualization?

2105
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:52,700
Well, in this study, they
had people perform this

2106
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,053
five days a week.

2107
01:33:55,556 --> 01:33:57,480
I believe that it was 15.

2108
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,840
Yes, it was 15 minutes
per day, five days a week

2109
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,700
for 12 weeks.

2110
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:04,200
So that's a lot of mental rehearsal.

2111
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,590
It's not a ton of time each
day, 15 minutes per day.

2112
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:08,300
But sitting down, closing your eyes

2113
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:13,140
and imagining going through
a particular skill practice

2114
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,783
or moving a weight.

2115
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:19,360
Maybe it's playing keys on
a piano if that's your thing

2116
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,610
or strings on a guitar,
for 15 minutes a day,

2117
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:25,610
five days per week for
12 weeks is considerable.

2118
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:27,973
I think most people, given the fact

2119
01:34:27,973 --> 01:34:30,770
that the actual practice,
the physical practice

2120
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:34,360
is going to lead to larger improvements,

2121
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,350
greater improvements then
would the mental training

2122
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:40,030
would opt for the actual
physical training.

2123
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,840
But of course, if you're on a plane

2124
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,510
and you don't have access to your guitar

2125
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,760
and you're certainly not
going to be sprinting

2126
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,250
up and down the aisle
or you are very serious

2127
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:52,327
about your craft and you want
to accelerate performance

2128
01:34:52,327 --> 01:34:53,993
of your craft or strength increases

2129
01:34:53,993 --> 01:34:57,070
or something of that sort,
then augmenting or adding in

2130
01:34:57,070 --> 01:35:00,750
the visualization training
very likely will compound

2131
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:03,350
the effects of the
actual physical training.

2132
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:06,480
There are not a lot of studies
looking at how visualization

2133
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:10,330
on top of pure physical training

2134
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:13,580
can increase the rates of learning

2135
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,210
and consolidation of learning, et cetera.

2136
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:18,900
It's actually a hard study to
do because hard to control for

2137
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,810
because what would you do in its place.

2138
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:23,510
You would probably add
actual physical training

2139
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:26,560
and then that's always going
to lead to greater effects.

2140
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,310
So the point is if you want
to use visualization training,

2141
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:34,590
great, but forget the idea
that visualization training

2142
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:37,760
is as good as the actual behavior.

2143
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,750
You hear this all the time.

2144
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,290
People say, do you know that
if you imagine an experience

2145
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:42,770
to your brain and to your body,

2146
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:45,090
it's exactly the same as
the actual experience.

2147
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:46,110
Absolutely not.

2148
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:47,700
This is not the way the
nervous system works.

2149
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,760
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to burst anybody's bubble,

2150
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,440
but your bubble is made of myths.

2151
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:56,420
And the fact of the
matter is that the brain,

2152
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:59,460
when it executes a movement is generating

2153
01:35:59,460 --> 01:36:01,882
proprioceptive feedback.

2154
01:36:01,882 --> 01:36:04,460
And that proprioceptive
feedback is critically involved

2155
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,790
in generating our sense of the experience

2156
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:08,670
and in things like learning.

2157
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:12,810
So I don't say this because
I don't like the idea

2158
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:14,260
that visualization couldn't work.

2159
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,283
In fact visualization does work,

2160
01:36:17,648 --> 01:36:18,481
but it doesn't work as well,

2161
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:20,600
it doesn't create the same millu,

2162
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,360
the same chemical millu,
the same environment

2163
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,350
as actual, physically
engaging in the behavior,

2164
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:30,580
the skill the resistance
training, et cetera.

2165
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,520
And I'd be willing to
wager that the same is true

2166
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,013
for experiences of all kinds.

2167
01:36:36,013 --> 01:36:40,050
PTSD is this incredibly
unfortunate circumstance

2168
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:43,670
in which there's a replay
often of the traumatic event

2169
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,510
that feels very real.

2170
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:47,640
But that's not to say
that the replay itself

2171
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:50,030
is the same as the actual event.

2172
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:52,130
And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with

2173
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:57,040
with the utmost level of
seriousness, it should be treated.

2174
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,200
In fact, my lab works on
these sorts of things,

2175
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,600
but my point about visualization
and imagining something

2176
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,390
not being the same as
the actual experience

2177
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:09,000
is grounded in this
idea of proprioception.

2178
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,070
And the fact that feedback
to the cerebellum,

2179
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:12,830
the cerebellum, talking to
other areas of the brain

2180
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,970
are critically involved in communicating

2181
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:16,410
to the rest of our nervous system.

2182
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,870
That not just that we believe
something is happening

2183
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:20,530
but something is actually happening.

2184
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:22,310
And in the case of muscle loads,

2185
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:25,010
muscles actually feeling tension,

2186
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:28,500
the actual feeling of
tension in the muscle.

2187
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,940
The contracting of the
muscle under that tension

2188
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:34,410
is part of the important
adaptation process.

2189
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:36,500
In a future episode, we'll
talk about hypertrophy

2190
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,650
and how that works at the
level of upper motor neurons,

2191
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:41,030
lower motor neurons and muscle itself.

2192
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:44,100
But for now just know that
visualization can work.

2193
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,100
It doesn't work as well
as real physical training

2194
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:50,420
and practice, but these effects of 35%

2195
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:54,020
or 13.5% increases are
pretty considerable.

2196
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,970
They're just not as great
as the 53% increases

2197
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,940
that come from actual physical training.

2198
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,500
For those of you that are interested

2199
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,937
in some of this skill
learning that more relates

2200
01:38:03,937 --> 01:38:07,430
to musical training, but also
how cadence and metronomes

2201
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:11,600
and tones, et cetera, can
support physical learning.

2202
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,710
If you're interested in that,
if are you a fussy and autos,

2203
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:17,410
there is a wonderful
review, also published

2204
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:20,320
in the Journal Neuron
again, excellent journal

2205
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:25,320
by Herholz and Zatorre,
that's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z

2206
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:29,910
and Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E.

2207
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:34,910
That really describes in
detail how musical training

2208
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:37,660
can impact all sorts of different things

2209
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:41,620
and how cadence training,
whether or not with tones

2210
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:44,520
or auditory feedback
and things of that sort

2211
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,730
carries over to not just
instrumental music training

2212
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:51,460
but also physical skill
learning of various kinds.

2213
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:52,810
So if you want to do the deep dive,

2214
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:55,050
that would be the place you
can find it easily online.

2215
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:57,010
It's available as a complete article

2216
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:58,780
free of charge, et cetera.

2217
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,650
Many of you are probably
asking what can I take

2218
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,890
in order to accelerate skill learning?

2219
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:06,220
Well, the conditions are going to vary,

2220
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:07,800
but motivation is key.

2221
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,530
You have to show up to
the training session

2222
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:13,420
motivated enough to focus your attention

2223
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,470
and to perform a lot of repetitions

2224
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:17,230
in the training sequence.

2225
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:19,370
That's just a prerequisite.

2226
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,760
There's no pill that's
going to allow you to do

2227
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,330
fewer repetitions and
extract more learning

2228
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:24,480
out of fewer repetitions.

2229
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,380
It's actually more a question
of what are the conditions

2230
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:30,870
that you can create for yourself
such that you can generate

2231
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:32,620
more repetitions per unit time.

2232
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:35,154
I think that's the right
way to think about it.

2233
01:39:35,154 --> 01:39:36,410
What are the conditions
that you can create

2234
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:38,190
for yourself in your mind and in your body

2235
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,600
that are going to allow you to focus?

2236
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,900
And I've talked about focus and plasticity

2237
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,610
and motivation in previous episodes.

2238
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:47,380
Please see those episodes if
you have questions about that.

2239
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:50,240
I've detailed a lot of tools
in the underlying science.

2240
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,960
So for some people, it might
be drinking a cup of coffee

2241
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,910
and getting hydrated before
the training session.

2242
01:39:54,910 --> 01:39:56,810
For some of you, it
might be avoiding coffee

2243
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:57,900
because it makes you too jittery

2244
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,620
and your attention jumps
all over the place.

2245
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,070
It's going to vary tremendously.

2246
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:04,420
There is no magic pill
that's going to allow you

2247
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:07,720
to get more out of less, that's
just not going to happen.

2248
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,150
It's simply not going to happen.

2249
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:10,580
You're not going to get more learning

2250
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,980
out of fewer repetitions or less time.

2251
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:15,890
However, there are a few compounds

2252
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:20,360
I think are worth mentioning
because of their ability

2253
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,640
to improve the actual
physical performance,

2254
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:25,640
the actual execution of
certain types of movements.

2255
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,680
And some of these have also been shown

2256
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,660
to improve cognitive function,

2257
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,490
especially in older population.

2258
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:34,070
So I'd be remiss if I didn't
at least mention them.

2259
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:36,120
I'm only going to mention
one today in fact.

2260
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:38,310
The one that's particularly interesting

2261
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:42,430
and for which there really
are a lot of data is alpha GPC

2262
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:45,840
and I'm going to attempt to pronounce

2263
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,430
what alpha GPC actually is.

2264
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,933
It's alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.

2265
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,970
Alpha GPC, alpha
glycerylphosphorylcholine.

2266
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:55,870
See, if I keep doing it
over and over repetitions,

2267
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:58,128
alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine.

2268
01:40:58,128 --> 01:40:58,961
There I made an error.

2269
01:40:58,961 --> 01:41:02,470
Okay, so the point is that alpha GPC,

2270
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,100
which is at least in the United States

2271
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,770
is sold over the counter
typically is taken in dosages

2272
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,660
of about 300 to 600 milligrams.

2273
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:14,420
That's a single dose or
have been shown to do

2274
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:18,040
a number of things that for
some of you might be beneficial.

2275
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,850
One is to enhance power output.

2276
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:22,490
So if you're engaging in
something like Shotput throwing

2277
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:25,470
or resistance training or sprinting

2278
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:28,100
or something where you have
to generate a lot of power,

2279
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,700
maybe you're doing rock
climbing, but you're working

2280
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,550
on a particular aspect
of your rock climbing

2281
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:36,190
that involves generating a
lot of force, a lot of power.

2282
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:40,700
Well then in theory, alpha GPC
could be beneficial to you.

2283
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:44,290
For the cognitive effects,
the dosages are much higher

2284
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:47,990
up to 1200 milligrams daily
divided into three doses

2285
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:49,730
of 400 milligrams is what the studies

2286
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:52,190
that I was able to find show or used.

2287
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:56,560
The effects on cognitive decline
are described as notable.

2288
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,580
Notable, meaning several
studies showed a significant

2289
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:04,425
but modest effect on in
offsetting cognitive decline,

2290
01:42:04,425 --> 01:42:06,580
in particular in older populations

2291
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:09,610
and some populations,
even with some reported

2292
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,320
neuro degeneration.

2293
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:13,730
Power output was notable.

2294
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:15,853
How notable, what does that mean, notable?

2295
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:20,743
A study noted a 14%
increase in power output.

2296
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:25,315
That's pretty substantial, 14%.

2297
01:42:25,315 --> 01:42:26,810
And if you think about it,
but it wasn't like a doubling

2298
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:28,020
or something of that sort.

2299
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:29,890
Believe it or not, the
symptoms of Alzheimer's

2300
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:33,640
have been shown at least
among the nutraceuticals

2301
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:37,210
of which alpha GPC is to
significantly improve cognition

2302
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:38,060
in people with Alzheimer's.

2303
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:40,020
Now this episode, isn't
about cognitive decline

2304
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:41,990
and longevity, we will talk about that,

2305
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:46,990
but this is a so-called
another effect of alpha GPC.

2306
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,080
Fat oxidation is increased by alpha GPC,

2307
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:55,990
growth hormone release
is promoted by alpha GPC

2308
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:57,090
although to a small degree.

2309
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:01,900
So as you can see, things
like alpha GPC in particular

2310
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,600
when they are combined
with low levels of caffeine

2311
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,240
can have these effects of
improving power output,

2312
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,300
can improve growth hormone release,

2313
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,770
can improve fat oxidation.

2314
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:14,890
All these things in theory
can support skill learning.

2315
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:17,080
But what they're really
doing is they're adjusting

2316
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,810
the foundation upon which
you are going to execute

2317
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:22,060
these many, many repetitions.

2318
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,640
The same thing would be
said for caffeine itself.

2319
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,220
If that's something that motivates you

2320
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:27,720
and gets you out of a chair to actually do

2321
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:30,040
the physical training,
then that's something

2322
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:33,030
that can perhaps improve or enhance

2323
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:34,270
the rate of skill learning

2324
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:36,830
and how well you retain those skills.

2325
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:40,017
Now on a previous episode I talked about,

2326
01:43:40,017 --> 01:43:43,910
and this was the episode on
epinephrin on adrenaline.

2327
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:47,600
I talked about how for mental,
for cognitive learning,

2328
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,880
it makes sense to spike epinephrin,

2329
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,190
to bump epinephrin levels
up adrenaline levels up

2330
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:57,060
after cognitive learning.

2331
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:59,930
For physical learning, it
appears to be the opposite

2332
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:02,690
that if caffeine is in your practice

2333
01:44:02,690 --> 01:44:05,240
or if you decide to try alpha GPC

2334
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,450
that you would want to do
that before the training,

2335
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:09,333
take it before the training use it.

2336
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,640
Its effect should extend
into the training,

2337
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:14,290
presumably throughout, and then afterward

2338
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:16,320
if you're thinking about
following some of the protocols

2339
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,950
that we discussed today,
that you would use

2340
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:21,690
some sort of idle time
where the brain can replay

2341
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:23,590
these motor sequences in reverse.

2342
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,401
And then of course, you want to do things

2343
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:26,400
that optimize your sleep.

2344
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,490
A lot of the questions I
get are about how different

2345
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:31,150
protocols and things that I described

2346
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:32,740
start to collide with one another.

2347
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:35,410
So let's say for instance,
you go to bed at 10:30

2348
01:44:35,410 --> 01:44:39,810
and you're going to do your
skill training at 9:30,

2349
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:42,610
well, taking a lot of caffeine
then is not going to be

2350
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:44,700
a good idea 'cause it's going
to compromise your sleep.

2351
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:48,270
So I'm not here to design
the perfect schedule for you

2352
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,450
because everyone's situation's vary.

2353
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:55,450
So the things to optimize
are repetitions, failures,

2354
01:44:55,670 --> 01:45:00,350
more repetitions, more failures
at the offset of training.

2355
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:02,950
Having some idle time that
can be straight into sleep

2356
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:06,420
or it could be simply letting
the brain just go idle

2357
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,380
for five to 10 minutes, mean
not focusing on anything,

2358
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:11,870
not scrolling, social media, not emailing,

2359
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:14,530
not ideally not even talking
to somebody just lying down

2360
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:16,300
or sitting quietly with your eyes closed

2361
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,820
letting those motor sequences replay.

2362
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:21,900
Then we talked about how one can come back

2363
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,760
for additional training sessions,

2364
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,130
use things like metronoming
where you're queuing

2365
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:30,070
your attention to some
external cue, some stimulus,

2366
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:32,420
in this case, an auditory
stimulus most likely

2367
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:34,760
and trying to generate more
repetitions per unit time.

2368
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,373
So again, it's repetitions
and errors, that's key.

2369
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:40,120
And then we also talked about some things

2370
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:42,800
that you can do involving
cerebellar neurophysiology

2371
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,970
to extend range of motion if
that's what's limiting for you

2372
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:49,880
or to use visualization
to augment the practice

2373
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:53,740
or let's say your particular
skill involves nice weather

2374
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:55,330
and it's raining or snowing outside

2375
01:45:55,330 --> 01:45:57,270
and you can't get outside or thunderstorm,

2376
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:59,190
then that's where visualization training

2377
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:02,020
might be a good replacement
under those conditions.

2378
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:04,510
Or in most cases is going
to be the kind of thing

2379
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:05,440
that you're going to want to do

2380
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:08,130
in addition to the actual physical skill

2381
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:10,890
or strength training session done,

2382
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:12,420
at least in the study that we described

2383
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:16,240
for 15 minutes a day, five days a week

2384
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,250
over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.

2385
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:20,830
So hopefully that makes it clear.

2386
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:23,370
Today we've covered a lot of mechanism.

2387
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:26,270
We talked so much about the
different motor pathway,

2388
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,500
central pattern generator.

2389
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:31,580
So you now are armed
with a lot of information

2390
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,400
about how you generate movement.

2391
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,760
And I like to think that you're also armed

2392
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,930
with a lot of information
about how to design protocols

2393
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:41,363
that are optimized for
you or if you're a coach,

2394
01:46:43,966 --> 01:46:46,170
for your trainees in order to optimize

2395
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:49,430
their learning of skills various kinds.

2396
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:53,090
Today we focused almost
entirely on motor skills,

2397
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:55,740
things like musical
skills or physical skills.

2398
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:58,880
These have some overlap,
they're partially overlapping

2399
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,080
with neuroplasticity, for
learning things like languages

2400
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,193
or math or engineering or
neuroscience for that matter.

2401
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:09,530
Before we depart, I just want to make sure

2402
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:13,360
that I return to a concept,
which is the ultradian cycle.

2403
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,510
Ultradian cycles are
these 90 minute cycles

2404
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:17,240
that we go through throughout
sleep and wakefulness

2405
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,950
that are optimal for
learning and attention.

2406
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:24,890
In the waking state, they
are the stages of sleep

2407
01:47:26,006 --> 01:47:26,839
in which we have either
predominantly slowey sleep

2408
01:47:26,839 --> 01:47:27,940
or rem sleep.

2409
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:29,800
Some of you who have been
following this podcast

2410
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,950
for a while might be asking,
well should a physical practice

2411
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:35,330
be 90 minutes.

2412
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:38,160
That's going to depend because
with physical practices,

2413
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,370
oftentimes for instance,
with strength training,

2414
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:41,510
that might be too long.

2415
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:44,020
You're not going to be able to
generate enough force output

2416
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:45,470
for it to be worthwhile.

2417
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:46,670
For golfing, I don't know.

2418
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:48,530
I've never played golf with
all my friends that play golf,

2419
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:50,640
they disappear onto the
golf course for many hours.

2420
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,710
So I know there's a lot
of walking and driving

2421
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:55,770
and other stuff, I even hear that somebody

2422
01:47:55,770 --> 01:48:00,130
carries your stuff around for
you sometimes, not always.

2423
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:02,750
But it's going to differ.

2424
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:05,320
A four hour golf game,
you're probably not swinging

2425
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:07,600
the golf club for four hours,
so it's going to depend.

2426
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,020
I would say that the ultradian
cycle is not necessarily

2427
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:15,510
a good constraint for skill
learning in most cases.

2428
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:17,950
And I should say that for
those of you that are short

2429
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,350
on time or have limited amounts of time,

2430
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:22,190
10 minutes of maximum repetitions,

2431
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:24,520
maximum focus skill learning work is going

2432
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,800
to be very beneficial.

2433
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,850
Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard

2434
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:33,560
not really focused work or
where you're not generating

2435
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,340
very many repetitions 'cause you're doing

2436
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,390
few repetitions then you're
texting on your phone

2437
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:38,550
or pay attention to something else,

2438
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:40,180
that's not going to be beneficial.

2439
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,350
It's really about the density of training

2440
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:43,230
inside of a session.

2441
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,300
So I think you should let the...

2442
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,960
Work toward maximal or
near maximum density

2443
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:51,010
of repetitions and failures
provided they're failures

2444
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:54,590
you can perform safely in order
to accelerate skill learning

2445
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:57,520
and don't let some
arbitrary or in this case,

2446
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,040
the ultradian constraint prevent you

2447
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:01,370
from engaging in that practice.

2448
01:49:01,370 --> 01:49:03,530
In other words, get the work
in, get as much work done

2449
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:05,220
as you can per unit time.

2450
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:08,240
And based on the science,
based on things that I've seen,

2451
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,300
based on things that I'm now involved in

2452
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:14,420
with various communities, you
will see the skill improve

2453
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:16,610
vastly at various stages.

2454
01:49:16,610 --> 01:49:18,170
Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start,

2455
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:20,810
it's not always a linear improvement

2456
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:23,600
but you will see incredible
improvement in skill.

2457

01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:25,690
In previous episodes and in this episode,

2483
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:27,330
I mentioned some supplements.

2484
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:31,280
Supplements certainly have
their place for various things.

2485
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,810
They aren't necessary, but
many people, including myself

2486
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:35,650
derive benefit from supplements

2487
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,700
for things like improving sleep
and immune system function

2488
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:40,570
and learning and so forth.

2489
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:42,770
If you're interested in seeing
the supplements that I take,

2490
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:46,140
you can go to thorne.com/u,

2491
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,500
that's the letter U slash Huberman

2492
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,740
and you can see the
supplements that I take.

2493
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:53,102
If you want to try any
of those supplements,

2494
01:50:53,102 --> 01:50:56,700
you can get 20% off simply by
accessing the Thorne webpage

2495
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:59,090
through that portal, as well as 20% off

2496
01:50:59,090 --> 01:51:01,560
any of the other supplements
that Thorne makes.

2497
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:03,060
The reason we've partnered with Thorne

2498
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:05,920
is because Thorne has the very
highest levels of stringency

2499
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,580
in terms of the quality of the supplements

2500
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:11,690
and the accuracy about the
amounts of each supplement

2501
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:12,523
that are in the bottle.

2502
01:51:12,523 --> 01:51:15,000
One of the major problems
in the supplement industry

2503
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,070
is that when supplements get tested,

2504
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:21,120
often it's the case that the
amount of a given ingredient

2505
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:24,660
is far lower or far greater
than what's reported

2506
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,493
on the bottle.

2507
01:51:25,493 --> 01:51:26,840
That's not the case for Thorne.

2508
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:29,790
Thorne has very high levels of stringency,

2509
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:31,320
they partnered with the Mayo Clinic

2510
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,770
and all the major sports teams

2511
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:34,750
and that's why we partnered
with them as well.

2512
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,230
So if you want to check those out again,

2513
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:41,220
it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E
slash the letter U/Huberman

2514
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:45,150
to get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes.

2515
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,060
And last but not least,
I want to thank you

2516
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,640
for your time and attention.

2517
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,240
I very much appreciate your
interest in neuroscience

2518
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:54,180
and in physiology and in
tools that are informed

2519
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:56,200
by neuroscience and physiology.

2520
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,850
Today, we talked all about skill learning.

2521
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:01,000
I hope that you'll
consider the information,

2522
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,810
you might even decide to
try some of these tools.

2523
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:05,430
If you do, please let us
know your results with them.

2524
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:07,120
Give us feedback in the comments

2525
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,313
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
