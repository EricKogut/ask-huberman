00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,410
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,740
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,915
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:08,498
[upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,920
My name is Andrew Huberman,

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,590
and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,970
and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,150
This podcast is separate

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,510
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

10
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,560
It is however, part of
my desire and effort

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,310
to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,440
and science related tools
to the general public.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,610
In keeping with that theme

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,540
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,740
Our first sponsor today is Theragun.

16
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,890
Theragun is a handheld
percussive therapy device

17
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,440
that releases deep muscle tension.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,060
I was first introduced to Theragun in 2017

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,915
while on a laboratory expedition.

20
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:45,840
We were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,900
filming great white sharks

22
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,770
for my laboratory studies on
fear using virtual reality

23
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,770
we were working very hard around the clock

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,190
and I and other people on the
trip were picking up a lot

25
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,460
of aches and pains and just
kind of chronic soreness.

26
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,720
Couple of people had
injuries that were flaring up

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,530
because of all the hard
work and lack of sleep.

28
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,990
Someone had a Theragun

29
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,760
and pretty soon it was
getting passed around.

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,780
It became the most
coveted device on board.

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,840
Everyone was using it to work

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,500
on these different sites of soreness.

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,330
And I really fell in love
with the thing so much

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,767
so that when I got back, I
immediately purchased one

35
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,966
and I've used it almost daily ever since,

36
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:20,290
I use it on muscles that are sore,

37
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,600
I use it on areas that
I'm really working on to

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,150
release tension and improve
tissue quality and so forth.

39
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,220
The great thing about
Theragun is it's really quiet

40
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,170
so you can use it while you're

41
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,298
in a conversation or while
you're watching a movie

42
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:34,490
and it doesn't disrupt
those activities at all.

43
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,927
If you want to try Theragun

44
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:40,927
you can try Theragun by going
to theragun.com/huberman

45
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,490
to get your gen four
Theragun, they start at $199.

46
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,250
But if you think about it, a
massage, which is an hour long

47
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,670
or 90 minutes long is typically
in that range of costs.

48
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,470
And this is something
you can use every day

49
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,200
whenever you want, and even
while enjoying other activities.

50
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,060
So that's theragun.com/huberman.

51
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,103
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is InsideTracker.

52
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:04,480
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition

53
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,970
platform that analyzes
data from your blood

54
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,419
and DNA to help you better
understand your body

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,690
and help you reach your health goals.

56
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,150
The great thing about InsideTracker

57
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,980
is that it gives you data
that you can make sense of.

58
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,240
I've long been a believer in
getting blood samples taken

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,980
and more recently I've become a believer

60
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,730
in getting DNA samples taken

61
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,130
in order to understand what's going

62
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,660
on at the level of
hormones, metabolic factors

63
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,600
and other things that profoundly
influence our immediate

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,110
and long-term health.

65
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,480
The problem always has been
getting those samples taken

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,700
and making sense of those samples.

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,210
InsideTracker makes all
of that really easy.

68
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,620
They'll even come to your
home to take the samples.

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,260
Then you get the information back.

70
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,920
And while typically after
getting information back

71
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,270
there's these long lists of numbers

72
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,890
and nobody knows what to do with them,

73
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,370
InsideTracker makes it really easy to

74
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,440
interpret what those numbers mean.

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,430
And it points to things

76
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,710
in terms of lifestyle, exercise,
nutrition, and so forth

77
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,860
that can help you adjust some

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,510
of the numbers that
you might need to bring

79
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,380
down or up to put into the
appropriate normal range.

80
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,800
So I find this whole process
to be immensely valuable

81
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,020
for guiding my health
choices and also just

82
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,062
for giving me peace of
mind about how my body

83
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:14,280
and the rest of my health
are doing internally.

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,300
Something you just can't know
without a blood and DNA test.

85
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,193
If you want to try
InsideTracker, you can go

86
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:24,106
to insidetracker.com/huberman,
and you'll get 25% off any

87
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:27,580
of their programs, you want
to put Huberman at checkout.

88
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,170
So that's insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 25% off any

89
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,680
of InsideTracker's plans and
put Huberman at checkout.

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,760
The third sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

91
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,300
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

92
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,670
probiotic drink.

93
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,172
I started using Athletic Greens in 2012.

94
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:48,330
So I'm delighted that they're
a sponsor of the podcast.

95
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,140
The reason I started using Athletic Greens

96
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,820
and the reason I still take
it once or twice per day,

97
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,430
is that I find it very
hard to know what vitamins

98
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,000
and minerals I need to take.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,130
And by drinking Athletic
Greens, I get it all in one

100
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,480
easy to consume great tasting formula.

101
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,710
I really do like the way it tastes.

102
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,060
I mix mine with water

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,230
and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

104
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,936
And to me it's delicious.

105
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,634
The other thing about Athletic Greens

106
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,812
that I really like are the probiotics

107
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,570
there are so much data
out there now telling us,

108
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,370
and I certainly believe based
on the data that I've seen

109
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,030
that probiotics are really
important for support

110
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,230
of the gut microbiome, the gut
brain axis, the immune system

111
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,550
and many other aspects of our biology.

112
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,210
So with Athletic Greens,
I get the vitamins

113
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,720
the minerals and the
probiotics that I need.

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,310
If you want to try Athletic Greens

115
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,880
you can go to athletigreens.com/huberman.

116
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,070
And if you do that, they'll
also give you a year supply

117
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,180
of vitamin D3K2.

118
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,430
Vitamin D3 we also know
is really important

119
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,390
for things like immune
system and metabolic support.

120
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,550
So that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman to get

121
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,460
Athletic Greens and a year's supply

122
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:58,199
of vitamin D3K2.

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,590
And they'll give you
five free travel packs.

124
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,340
Today we're talking all about emotions,

125
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,040
and emotions are central to
our entire experience of life.

126
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,630
Whether or not we're happy or sad

127
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,280
or depressed or angry
is our life experience.

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,930
And yet I think with all the importance

129
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,180
we've placed on emotions.

130
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,376
Very few people actually
understand how emotions arise

131
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,210
in our brain and body.

132
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,302
And I mentioned brain and body
because as you'll see today

133
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:28,320
emotions really capture the
brain body relationship.

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,900
We cannot say that emotions
arise just from what

135
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,760
happens in our head.

136
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,900
It also involves events, biological events

137
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,163
chemical events within our body.

138
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,610
The other thing about emotions

139
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,740
is that there's no real agreement

140
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,509
as to what's a good
emotion or a bad emotion.

141
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,720
Today we're gonna talk about the biology

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,920
of the chemicals and pathways
that give rise to emotions.

143
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,619
And I'm going to equip you with several,

144
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:55,530
if not many tools that
will allow you to regulate

145
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,538
and change and steer your
emotions should you want,

146
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,100
but not using the typical advice.

147
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,770
You know, everyone's
probably heard of this thing.

148
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,830
Oh if you're feeling
depressed, just smile,

149
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,230
you know, it's impossible to
be depressed while smiling.

150
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,280
Look, if that were true

151
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,860
we wouldn't have any depressed people

152
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,490
because depressed people
don't want to be depressed.

153
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,049
And it is not the case
that simply smiling will

154
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:17,490
reverse depression or sadness.

155
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,060
And it's simply not the case

156
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,680
that smiling can inhibit sadness.

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,410
It just doesn't work that way.

158
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,860
However, it is the case

159
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,210
that certain things that are happening

160
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,060
in our body influence
how our brain functions

161
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,804
and the chemicals that are released.

162
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:35,137
And today we're gonna talk
a lot about how the brain

163
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:38,530
and body interact to create
these things called emotions

164
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,910
in the context of food and nutrition.

165
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,710
And the reason we're doing that is not

166
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,620
because I am beating the drum

167
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,680
about particular diet
regimens or anything.

168
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,990
In fact, I'm not gonna do any of that.

169
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,320
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna review some

170
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,540
of the most important
scientific data that point

171
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,570
to how ingesting certain
nutrients, both macro nutrients

172
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,580
like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,

173
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,850
as well as micronutrients
can impact the chemicals

174
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,610
in our brain that give rise
to the feelings of being happy

175
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,920
or sad or sleepy or alert
when you want to be sleepy

176
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,780
or sleepy when you want to be alert.

177
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,510
So this is sure to be a broad discussion

178
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,140
and yet we're gonna get very specific

179
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,313
about what emotions are,
how they arise in the body,

180
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:23,093
tools that one can use in order

181
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,650
to better control their emotions,

182
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,370
tools that people can
use to believe it or not

183
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,010
feel happier or feel calmer.

184
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,920
And that's because in
the last 20 years or so

185
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,580
there's been an explosion
of scientific studies

186
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,080
exploring how the brain and body interact

187
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,580
to support certain neurochemicals

188
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,960
that give us these feelings

189
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,130
of being alert and happy
or depressed or certain

190
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,610
that our life is gonna be terrible

191
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,790
or certain that our life
is going to be great.

192
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,670
So as mysterious as all that might sound

193
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,080
and confusing as all that might sound

194
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,870
we're gonna make it very clear today.

195
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,860
And you're gonna come away
from this conversation

196
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,225
with a lot of tools that
you can act on immediately.

197
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:03,930
And those tools are
grounded in scientific data.

198
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,080
We are gonna provide links

199
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,044
to several of the studies,
and I'm gonna mention

200
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:10,060
several of those studies as we go along.

201
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,640
But overall, the goal today is

202
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,104
for you to understand how
moods and emotions arise

203
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,227
and the different pathways in your brain

204
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:18,210
and body that allow them to happen

205
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,580
and how you can use those
pathways to change those emotions

206
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,070
and the tools that you can rely

207
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,020
on in very specific ways to shift

208
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,260
from being, say, slightly
depressed, to feeling happier.

209
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,695
There actually are ways to do that,

210
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:35,520
or from feeling too alert and
anxious to feeling calmer.

211
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,577
And these are tools that are distinct

212
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:39,690
from the tools I've talked
about in previous episodes.

213
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,485
The discussion around emotions has a long

214
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:44,390
and rich history going back to Darwin.

215
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,620
And even long before Darwin,

216
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,700
this is a conversation that philosophers

217
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,180
and scientists have
been having for hundreds

218
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,763
if not thousands of years.

219
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:56,000
The idea that Darwin put forth

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
and that was really attractive

221
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,430
for about the last hundred years was

222
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:02,070
that emotions are universal and that some

223
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,790
of the facial expressions
around emotion are universal

224
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,207
and other people have
capitalized on that idea.

225
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,200
And to some extent it's true.

226
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,640
I mean, I think that the
two most robust examples

227
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,440
of that would be when we see something

228
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,971
or we smell something or we
taste something that we like,

229
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,650
there does tend to be
a postural leaning in.

230
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,110
We tend to inhale air at
that time, we tend to bring

231
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,530
in more of whatever chemical
substances there is.

232
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,860
We tend to these mm's and kind

233
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,790
of lean in closer to things
that are attractive to us.

234
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,310
And when we see and experience
things that we don't like

235
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,890
sometimes it's a mild aversion.

236
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,640
We just kind of lean back or look away.

237
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,020
Other times it's an intensive version

238
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,380
of disgust and we tend to cringe our face.

239
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,740
We tend to avoid inhaling
any of the chemicals.

240
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
This probably has roots

241
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,580
in ancient biological mechanisms
that are to prevent us

242
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,620
from ingesting things that are bad for us,

243
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,500
chemical compounds and tastes
that might be poisonous.

244
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,441
So much of the foundation
of any discussion

245
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:07,970
about emotion has to center
around this kind of push pull

246
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,750
of attraction to things
or aversion from things.

247
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,600
Now that's a very basic way
of thinking about emotions

248
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,810
but if you think about
it, it works for a lot

249
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,720
of different circumstances
and in the brain everywhere

250
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,980
from the deep circuits of
the brain to the more kind

251
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,070
of what we call higher order
evolved centers of the brain.

252
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,059
We have this push pull thing where

253
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,890
either a previous episode,
I talked about go,

254
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,470
the circuits that allow
you to emphasize action

255
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,910
and then no go circuits, the
circuits and the basal ganglia

256
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,330
that allow you to de-emphasize
action and prevent action.

257
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,120
We talked about how that's a push pull.

258
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,900
So aversion and attraction
is a push pull too.

259
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,219
Delight or happiness or
excitement are attractions

260
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:52,663
to certain things and ideas,
songs, people, places, foods

261
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:55,168
aversion is a leaning out.

262
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,576
It's a disgust, it's an avoidance.

263
00:10:57,576 --> 00:11:01,145
And so we can break down the
discussion about emotions

264
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:04,540
into these simpler versions of themselves,

265
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,997
but at the core of that
of attraction or aversion

266
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:11,930
is an important theme that
you might realize already.

267
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,256
But most people tend to overlook

268
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,200
which is that there's an action there

269
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,378
you're either moving forward

270
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,880
or you're moving away from something.

271
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,338
And any time you're talking about action

272
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,860
in the nervous system, you're
talking about motor behaviors.

273
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,180
You're talking about
literally the contraction

274
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,660
of muscles to move you
toward or away from things.

275
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,437
And any time you're talking about nerve

276
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:35,230
to muscle and action, you're
talking about the brain

277
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,944
and the body, because the
brain can't move itself

278
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:43,620
that the brain has a body so
that the organism can move.

279
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,208
And the body has a brain so

280
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,880
that the organism, you,
can move toward or away

281
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,430
from things that you deem
to be good or bad for you.

282
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,650
Now, some of these things that
we're attracted to and some

283
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,410
of them that we avoid are what
we call innate or hardwired.

284
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,940
You know, when we taste bitter compounds,

285
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,810
I'm not saying about bitter

286
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,310
like a little bit of a
bitters in your drink

287
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,420
or something like that, but
really bitter compounds.

288
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,460
We tend to avoid those

289
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,520
because they're associated with poisons.

290
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,397
When we taste things that
are sweet or that are savory

291
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:15,740
we tend to pursue more of those.

292
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,831
We tend to lean toward those so to speak

293
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:20,130
and we tend to not avoid them.

294
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,430
So there are circuits in the brain

295
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,640
for aversion and for
attraction toward things.

296
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,240
And the body is governing a lot of that.

297
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,200
And so immediately in this conversation

298
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,056
I want to raise an important point

299
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:34,008
which is about a nerve pathway that many,

300
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:37,220
many people have heard of that
gets discussed all the time.

301
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,834
And that is one of the
most kind of oversold

302
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:43,480
for the wrong reasons and
undersold, unfortunately,

303
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,890
for its real power,
which is the vagus nerve.

304
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,580
So the vagus nerve is one, not the only,

305
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,230
but one way in which our brain

306
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,223
and body are connected and
regulates our emotional states.

307
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:59,560
Now, many of you have probably
heard about polyvagal theory.

308
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,070
I'm gonna talk about this today.

309
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,906
Polyvagal theory was
popularized by Stephen Porges

310
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,289
and it's an interesting theory,

311
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,170
certain aspects of it, frankly,
hold up to the science,

312
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,820
some of it doesn't.

313
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,495
And I'm gonna discuss all of that today.

314
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:17,070
A lot of the vagus and the excitement

315
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,620
about the vagus, V-A-G-U-S,

316
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,970
is because it's somehow got
into the mind of the public

317
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,180
that the vagus is involved
in calming us down.

318
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,580
So what is the vagus nerve?

319
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,960
Okay, we're gonna make this really simple,

320
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,280
in particular for those
that are just listening,

321
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,310
you can just imagine this,

322
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,840
for those are watching I'll
point to the various areas,

323
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,860
but basically vagus is
the 10th cranial nerve

324
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,376
which basically means that the neurons,

325
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:46,210
the control center of
each of those neurons

326
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,120
in the vagus lives just kind
of near the neck, right?

327
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,600
And a branch of the vagus
goes into the brain.

328
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,220
They send a little wire into the brain.

329
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,270
The other branch goes into the periphery

330
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,970
but not just the gut.

331
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,080
It goes into the stomach, the intestines

332
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,690
the heart, the lungs,
and the immune system.

333
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,720
So this vagus nerve is incredible

334
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
because it's taking information

335
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,360
from the body and it has two directions.

336
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,240
The first is what we call sensory.

337
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,130
So it's sensing things that
are happening in the gut

338
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,660
in the lungs, everything,
for example, in the lungs

339
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,190
when our lungs are distended,
the vagus nerve senses that

340
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,650
and sends that information
up into the brain.

341
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,560
It also consents things in
the gut like how distended

342
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,950
or empty your stomach happens to be,

343
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,320
it can sense heart rate.

344
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,330
It can sense your immune
system, whether or not

345
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,620
you have bacteria or things
invading you in your body.

346
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,550
So it sends that
information up to the brain.

347
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,520
So it's a two-way street

348
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,780
and sensory information
is going up to the brain.

349
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,157
That's all vagus.

350
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:44,190
So it's like a super
highway sensory information

351
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,160
going one way and in the other
direction is motor control.

352
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,190
So the vagus is not
just for sensing things.

353
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,560
It's actually for controlling things.

354
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,033
It's got a sensory pathway
and a motor pathway.

355
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,784
So that's the first thing I
think everyone should know

356
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,020
about the vagus.

357
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,770
In fact, it's so important
that I feel like this is as

358
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,120
important as people knowing

359
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,840
that walking involves
flexors and extensors.

360
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,200
And if you don't think that's
important, it's as important

361
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,730
as walking, frankly,
because the vagus is the way

362
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,670
in which you can govern
the brain body connection.

363
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,180
And in which you can steer
various aspects of your mood

364
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,340
and wellbeing, but most people

365
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,240
just don't understand how to use it.

366
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,970
So first you got to understand what it is.

367
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,570
So you've got sensory information coming

368
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,665
from all these different organs
of the body up to the brain.

369
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,500
You've got motor information going

370
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,150
from the brain back to the body.

371
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,580
And so you've got this
super highway within you.

372
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,130
Now what actually regulates the vagus.

373
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,460
Oftentimes you'll hear things

374
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,220
like, oh this particular behavior

375
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,670
rubbing your face at a
particular location or breathing

376
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,960
in a particular way, or
a warm bath or something

377
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,580
stimulates the vagus.

378
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,776
Well, right now, I want
everyone to know that,

379
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:53,680
quote unquote, stimulating
the vagus broadly speaking

380
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,970
is a terrible way to think about the vagus

381
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,460
because do you know what,

382
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,300
if you have a contaminant inside your body

383
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,640
the vagus senses that and
projects that information

384
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
to your brain, and you
start to generate a fever

385
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,020
you start to try and kill
that contaminant in your body.

386
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,410
So I don't know that you want
to stimulate the vagus just

387
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,960
as a general theme today,
we're going to get specific

388
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,924
about how you can activate
particular circuits,

389
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:21,220
certain pathways from
certain organs to the brain

390
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,740
in order to feel better or
relieve certain conditions.

391
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,920
But you certainly don't want
to just stimulate the vagus.

392
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,969
Now excitement about the vagus in part

393
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,710
is because of what quite honestly,

394
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,810
was a fairly pioneering
theory about the vagus

395
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,330
which is his polyvagal theory.

396
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,170
So polyvagal, the word poly means many,

397
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,320
is cool because it acknowledges

398
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
that the vagus has a lot
of different branches.

399
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,790
It's not just one thing.

400
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,150
And so I really liked that.

401
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,130
I liked the naming polyvagal.

402
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,172
The idea that Porges has
put forward was that there's

403
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,280
a dorsal vagus, which is
kind of runs in the back

404
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,720
of the spinal cord, which
is involved in alertness

405
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,610
and activation and kind of
fight or flight type stuff.

406
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,640
And that there's a ventral pathway

407
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,957
and that that's involved in
more kind of empathic behaviors.

408
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:13,240
That is not quite in agreement

409
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
with the modern anatomy,

410
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,750
but he was doing the best
with what he had at the time.

411
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,290
So, okay.

412
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,869
The problem I have with
the polyvagal theory

413
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,629
is the way that it's
discussed people often say,

414
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,680
oh if your dorsal vagus is too active

415
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,202
then you tend to be someone
who's a little too keyed

416
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:32,470
up and people who are kind
of in a state of freeze

417
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,190
or kind of flacid and kind of

418
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,056
like just not really active

419
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,000
and they're just lethargic.

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,030
Well, then that pathway is hypoactive.

421
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,290
It should be more active.

422
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,918
So there are a lot

423
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:46,720
of theories about how
psychology maps onto the vagus.

424
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,380
That as far as I know, don't
map to any real physiology.

425
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,130
Now, the other problem with this kind

426
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,770
of the way that the
polyvagal theory is discussed

427
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,200
probably not by the real
experts, but by a lot of people

428
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,290
is that people start to
diagnose different psychological

429
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,780
and physical manifestations
through the vagus.

430
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,130
They would say things like, Oh

431
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,090
this person is hyper
flexible at the joints

432
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,050
and therefore their dorsal
vagus isn't active enough

433
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,150
or something like that.

434
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,120
And it's really kind of gone
way outside the lane lines.

435
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,320
So today we're gonna
clean up a lot of that.

436
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,500
Let's make it really simple

437
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,190
about how the vagus actually works.

438
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,080
At least as we understand
it today in 2021.

439
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,410
First of all, as I mentioned,
you have sensory information

440
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,470
the same way that you
detect light with your eyes

441
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,980
or you hear sounds with
your ears, you have sensors

442
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,630
in your gut that sense how
full or empty your gut is.

443
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,550
It can also sense how acidic your gut is.

444
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,650
It can sense various
things within your gut.

445
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,780
Your heart is doing the same.

446
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,850
It's informing the brain how
fast your heart is beating,

447
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,080
how full your lungs are
has been communicated

448
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,100
and then the status of your immune system.

449
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,690
So the way to think

450
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,420
about the vagus is the
same way I would think

451
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,870
about the eyes.

452
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,820
The eyes are looking at colors,
they're looking at motion

453
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,117
they're looking how bright it is.

454
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:03,130
And each one of those things,

455
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,380
those features is telling the
brain something different.

456
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,730
So the brain can decide
when to be awake or asleep

457
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,563
whether or not it's looking

458
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,720
at somebody's attractive or unattractive.

459
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,549
The vagus nerve is also
analyzing many features

460
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,360
within the body and informing the brain

461
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,910
of how to feel about that and what to do.

462
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,127
So a really good example that
I think is an exciting one is

463
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:26,970
as it relates to sugar.

464
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,390
So we all know that sweet
things generally tastes good.

465
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,210
I'm not particularly a
fan of very sweet things.

466
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,720
You know, I'd much rather have

467
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,470
cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.

468
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,350
I like savory fatty foods,
but I do like sweet foods.

469
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,030
And most people find sweet
foods to be attractive.

470
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,620
They want them, they might

471
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,700
or they might not be able
to regulate their behavior

472
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,570
around them, but they want them.

473
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,970
And what's really interesting
is that for hundreds of years

474
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,010
people have thought that that's

475
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,750
because of the way that sweet foods taste.

476
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,820
So that makes sense, right?

477
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,100
You eat something that tastes sweet.

478
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,470
You want more of it.

479
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,990
Well, it turns out

480
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,860
that it's much more interesting than that.

481
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,570
When you eat something sweet

482
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,320
within your stomach,
you have cells, neurons,

483
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,290
that sense the presence of sugary foods

484
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,770
independent of their taste
and signal to the brain.

485
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,320
So those sensors, those
neurons send information

486
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,170
up the vagus to your brain

487
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,780
goes through a series of stations.

488
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,580
And then you release dopamine.

489
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,705
This molecule that makes you want more

490
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:34,410
of whatever it is that you just ingested.

491
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,480
In fact, this pathway is so powerful

492
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,960
that they've done experiments

493
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,440
where they completely numb all the taste

494
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,500
and feeling in somebody's
mouth they're blindfolded.

495
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,490
So they don't know what they're eating

496
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,840
and they're eating a food.

497
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,970
That's either sugary or not sugary.

498
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,160
And what they find is

499
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,870
that even though people
can't taste the sugary food

500
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,730
they crave more of the
food that contains sugar

501
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,500
because of the sensors in
the gut, that sense sugar.

502
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,690
So to put this differently,
you actually have sensors

503
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,160
within your body that make you crave sugar

504
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,300
independent of the sweet
taste of those things.

505
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,570
Now that's incredible.

506
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,840
And what it does, and what it tells us is

507
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
that we have circuits in
our body that are driving us

508
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,906
towards certain behaviors
and making us feel good

509
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:22,250
even though we can't perceive them.

510
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,970
Now, for those of you
that are really interested

511
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,830
in gut intuition and kind of gut feelings

512
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,310
this is a gut feeling except
this is a chemical gut feeling.

513
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,640
This is a particular set of
neurons detecting that something

514
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,595
in your body has a particular feature,

515
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,829
in this case the presence of sugars,

516
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:41,059
and sending information to the brain

517
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:44,040
essentially to control your behavior.

518
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,960
And I find this remarkable,

519
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,410
because what it means is
that what we call attractive

520
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,500
isn't always coming from our thoughts

521
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,630
about that or our feelings,
or even our perception.

522
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,400
We are drawn to particular
foods and we're drawn

523
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,490
to perhaps also to
particular people, places

524
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,320
and other things because of information

525
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,940
that's coming from our body.

526
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,063
And we're gonna talk about

527
00:22:07,063 --> 00:22:08,040
what one can do with this information.

528
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,400
I know many people are thoughtful
or concerned about sugars

529
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,760
these days thinking we
all ingest too much sugar.

530
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,120
There's sugar snuck into
all the things we eat.

531
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,190
And indeed, that's true.

532
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,750
I mean, this should completely
reframe the way that we think

533
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,050
about the sort of so-called
hidden sugars in foods.

534
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,810
What this means is that even
if a food is very savory

535
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,700
like a piece of pizza or a piece of bread

536
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,520
or even like a salad dressing

537
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,180
if there's sugar snuck into
that and you can't taste it

538
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,370
you will still crave more of that thing

539
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,600
without knowing that you
crave it because it has sugar.

540
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,028
In other words,

541
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,160
you might find yourself
wanting certain foods

542
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,570
and not knowing why you want those foods.

543
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,600
So I find this to be a fascinating aspect

544
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,524
of our biology and yes, it
relates to mood and emotion.

545
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:55,250
And we'll talk about
how that is in a moment.

546
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,984
So let's just back up a
bit and ask the question

547
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:00,660
why do we eat certain things?

548
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,480
And why do certain
foods make us feel good?

549
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,070
And other foods actually
make us feel anxious.

550
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,710
I think some people may
be familiar with this.

551
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,090
Other people might not,

552
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,740
but most people don't realize
that as you approach eating

553
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,290
there's an anxiety associated with that.

554
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,903
It's an alertness.

555
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:19,420
Remember in the previous discussions,

556
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,030
or even if you don't and
you haven't seen those,

557
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,656
all of your moods and feelings
of wellbeing are anchored

558
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,370
on this continuum of
alertness versus calmness.

559
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,890
And we hear so often
about rest and digest.

560
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,180
You know that, oh, after
we eat, we feel really nice

561
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,087
and full, hopefully comfortably
full and not too full.

562
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:37,530
And we're relaxing.

563
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,630
And we feel satiated, it's
associated with serotonin

564
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,480
this molecule of satiation.

565
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,130
That's all true.

566
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,400
But what most people don't
know is that there's an area

567
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,250
of the hypothalamus.

568
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,780
So deepen the brain kind of
in the middle deep portion

569
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,650
of the brain called the
lateral hypothalamus.

570
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,220
And the lateral hypothalamus
is really interesting

571
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,580
because it controls feeding,
but it inhibits feeding.

572
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,990
It stops us from feeding.

573
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,150
And there's another area in the brain.

574
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,510
If you want names, I'll give them to you.

575
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,180
If you don't want names, just ignore them,

576
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,306
delete them from your
memory and awareness,

577
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,160
called the locus coeruleus,

578
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,011
now the locus coeruleus sits back further

579
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,670
in the brainstem and it
releases norepinephrine

580
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,520
which is essentially adrenaline.

581
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,727
It makes us feel alert.

582
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:22,540
Now, locus coeruleus has a
lot of different functions

583
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,690
in the brain, but when we are going to eat

584
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,150
let's say we walk into a
restaurant, we sit down

585
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,990
or we're preparing a meal,

586
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,810
locus coeruleus is known

587
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,120
to release noradrenaline in the brain.

588
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,190
It's creating a kind of alertness.

589
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,350
This has ancient utility, but
it's creating this alertness.

590
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,980
And for many people, they experience

591
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,110
that as they approach
food as stress as anxiety.

592
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,850
But what's interesting is
that as we approach food

593
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,787
locus coeruleus is releasing
all these molecules

594
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:54,510
that make us feel more anxious and alert

595
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,130
sometimes it's felt as excitement.

596
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,360
And that asks probably to do
with how we feel about food

597
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,597
generally, are we happy with
our relationship with food?

598
00:25:00,597 --> 00:25:02,880
Are we trying to restrict
our relationship to food,

599
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,070
are people coming over for
dinner, all that will play

600
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,190
in of course, but there's a certain stress

601
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,920
and anxiety upon approach to food.

602
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,220
And as we approach food
and we feel that anxiety

603
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,769
locus coeruleus activates
the lateral hypothalamus

604
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,883
in a way that inhibits feeding

605
00:25:20,883 --> 00:25:23,210
that makes us not want to eat.

606
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,680
So a lot of people who have kind

607
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,720
of pre-meal anxiety or anxiety around food

608
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,730
and they can't seem to just calm down

609
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,220
and have a good meal to access
that later rest and digest.

610
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,580
A lot of that is because

611
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,640
of this heightened stress upon
approach to food and a lot

612
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,900
of the tools that are out
there, both for eating disorders

613
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,700
and for just kind of the general
public who isn't suffering

614
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,040
from eating disorders, things
like mindfulness around meals.

615
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,873
You know, they always tell you

616
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:50,510
you should never eat when stressed.

617
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm sorry, but my life is not organized

618
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,310
in a way that I can do that.

619
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,450
I would never eat.

620
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,200
Right because I eat when I'm awake

621
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,100
and I don't know if I'm stressed,

622
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,336
but I don't think I am but I tend to

623
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,300
run around a lot during the day.

624
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,750
I don't generally take time to do two

625
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,360
or three deep breaths before I eat.

626
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,363
I generally will just eat.

627
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,433
That can be healthy

628
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:13,180
or unhealthy depending on the
quality of your digestion.

629
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,377
I think using digestion
as a guide is good,

630
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:19,740
but a lot of people aren't
aware that this interaction

631
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,890
between locus coeruleus
and lateral hypothalamus

632
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,770
is a basic mechanism
where we are supposed to

633
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,920
get a little bit alert and
anxious around mealtime.

634
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,740
And then as we eat, the mechanisms

635
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,810
for calming and satiation
are supposed to kick in

636
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,620
and those mechanisms involve

637
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,060
as I mentioned earlier, two things.

638
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,490
One is how things taste,
digestion starts in the mouth.

639
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,393
Of course, we taste our food.

640
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,130
Everyone tells us we
should chew our food more.

641
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,480
Yes, that can improve digestion.

642
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,640
We're not supposed to drink
too many fluids as we eat.

643
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,447
That's true too, but a lot
of how we feel while we eat

644
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:56,870
and after we eat is because

645
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,480
of this vagus sensing
of what's in our gut.

646
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,920
It's sending information all the time.

647
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,181
Is there sugar?

648
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:06,200
Are there fats?

649
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,260
Are there contaminants?

650
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,640
There are a lot of information.

651
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,440
These so-called parallel
pathways that are going

652
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,150
up into our brain that regulate whether

653
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,400
or not we want to eat
more of something or not.

654
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,890
And there are accelerators,

655
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,536
things that make us want to
eat more, like sugar and fats

656
00:27:20,536 --> 00:27:22,430
because those are nutrient dense.

657
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,670
And they helps generally,
at least in the short term

658
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,170
support the survival of animals,

659
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,130
but also amino acids.

660
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,928
And this is very important.

661
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:33,130
There are a lot of data,

662
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,130
but much of what comes from
the data on what people eat

663
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,052
and how much they eat is
from a subconscious detection

664
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:47,052
of how many amino acids
and what the array,

665
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,700
meaning the constellation of
amino acids is in a given food.

666
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,780
And it's fair to say that the sum total

667
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,730
of these studies pointing
in a direction where

668
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,730
people will basically eat, not
until their stomach is full

669
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,530
but until the brain perceives

670
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,880
that they have adequate
intake of amino acids.

671
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,450
Now, this is a conversation
that comes up in the context of

672
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,780
you know, the meat, only the keto,

673
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,810
the kind of zone diet,

674
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,620
the Mediterranean diet, the vegan diet.

675
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,620
I'm largely going to ignore
the kind of strict camps today.

676
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,140
I will talk a little bit about it,

677
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,937
because I think each one
of them actually taps

678
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:28,880
into something important about this brain

679
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,600
body relationship that
the other ones don't.

680
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,450
But I don't want to get
into a discussion about

681
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,470
the ethics of different foods

682
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,900
of animal based or non animal based.

683
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,310
'Cause that's not the topic today.

684
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,780
It's really about nutrient
sensing and amino acid sensing.

685
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,200
So we generally will eat

686
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,490
until our gut tells our brain
that we have adequate amounts

687
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,510
of these amino acids.

688
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,360
Amino acids of course are important

689
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,500
because they are the building
blocks of sure, muscle,

690
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,530
and the other things in
our body that need repair.

691
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,113
But what most people don't realize

692
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:02,640
is that amino acids are
what the neurochemicals

693
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,433
in the brain are made from.

694
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,720
Now, this is vitally important.

695
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,110
Okay, so we've heard
dopamine is this molecule

696
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,210
that makes you feel good.

697
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,800
Actually dopamine is a molecule
that makes you feel good.

698
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,317
It's released within the brain.

699
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:18,734
And it does feel very good
when you have dopamine release,

700
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:22,760
dopamine releases caused
by surprise, excitement,

701
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,236
events that you're looking
forward to and they turnout well,

702
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:28,250
it is inhibited by events
you're looking forward

703
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,540
to that don't work out when someone says

704
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,690
they're going to call that you're really

705
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,600
really excited to talk
to, and then they don't,

706
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,790
or you thought a movie
was gonna be really great

707
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,450
and it's not, or you expect a
meal to be really delicious.

708
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,260
And it's kind of, eh, and we actually

709
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,093
there's a name for that.

710
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:44,710
It's called reward prediction error.

711
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,110
And you can actually
use this in the context

712
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,420
of meals and plans in a
way that's very useful

713
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,860
with yourself and people you know,

714
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,280
essentially if you expect
something to be really terrific

715
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,249
it really does place a higher expectation

716
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:01,120
at the chemical level.

717
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,630
So if you don't get as much dopamine

718
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,762
as you're expecting from something,

719
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,910
so you you hear about a
really great restaurant

720
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,208
or a place that has a really, in my case,

721
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,165
I have, I wouldn't call it an addiction.

722
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:14,060
I would call it more of an
affliction for croissants.

723
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,300
The best vegetable of
course, is the croissant.

724
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,590
And I get really excited

725
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,530
about the fact that someone will tell me,

726
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,850
oh there's this place and they
have incredible croissants.

727
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,820
You gotta go there.

728
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,380
So I get really excited, and I'll go.

729
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,920
And just them telling me

730
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,300
that it's gonna be really terrific

731
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,820
raises an expectation,
a dopamine expectation.

732
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,020
And unless those croissants are amazing

733
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,460
chances are I'm going to experience them

734
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,350
as less good, less satisfying.

735
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,210
I will truly release less
dopamine than I would

736
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,260
had they just said, oh yeah,

737
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,150
I think that there are
croissants down the street.

738
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,760
Or if I just tried one at random,

739
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,310
and that's because of this
reward prediction error

740
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,238
your expectation of
something releases dopamine

741
00:30:54,238 --> 00:30:58,070
and the actual event releases dopamine.

742
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,950
And if the event related dopamine does not

743
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,280
exceed the expectation or

744
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,290
at least match it, there's
a much higher tendency

745
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,550
that you won't pursue that thing again.

746
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,150
So dopamine is really powerful

747
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,360
and it's not just the molecule of reward.

748
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,010
It is the molecule of desire.

749
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,784
It's the molecule of wanting

750
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:18,450
not just the molecule of having.

751
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,119
And a book, since people often
ask for book recommendations.

752
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,800
I don't know the author
personally, but I love the book.

753
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,370
It's called "The Molecule Of More".

754
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,750
It's a terrific book.

755
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,238
I wish I had written it, frankly,

756
00:31:28,238 --> 00:31:29,920
but if you want to learn more

757
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,690
about dopamine reward prediction error

758
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,880
and how dopamine regulates
various aspects of your emotional

759
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,080
and motivational life,
it's a terrific read.

760
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,710
Dopamine is what's going to
lead us to want to eat more

761
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,190
of something or to not
want more of something,

762
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,180
because dopamine really is about craving.

763
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,150
It's about motivation
and it's about desire.

764
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,470
And as I mentioned,
these amino acid sensors

765
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,810
in our gut are detecting
how many amino acids

766
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,340
but they're also detecting
which amino acids.

767
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,320
And there's a particular
amino acid called L-tyrosine

768
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,970
which comes from food.

769
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,510
You can look up online, which
foods contain L-tyrosine.

770
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,740
It is in meats.

771
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,700
It is in nuts.

772
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,564
It is also in some plant-based foods.

773
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:15,564
L-tyrosine is the precursor
to a couple other molecules

774
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,650
like L-DOPA, et cetera,
that make dopamine.

775
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,294
And so there's a misconception
out there that most

776
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:25,147
of the serotonin is in our gut.

777
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:27,277
And most of the dopamine is in our gut.

778
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,930
And therefore our mood is in our gut.

779
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,650
That's not quite the way it works.

780
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,530
Okay. we'll talk about
serotonin in a moment

781
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,190
but dopamine is synthesized

782
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,920
from the amino acids that you eat.

783
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,240
However, the dopamine
neurons that give rise

784
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,999
to these feelings of good or wanting more

785
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:48,680
or desire and motivation,
those reside in the brain.

786
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,950
So we don't want to get too confused.

787
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,070
We want to respect and honor the power

788
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,050
of the gut and this vagal
pathway, but it's really neurons

789
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,530
within your brain that drive the pursuit

790
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,660
and decision-making,
so what does this mean?

791
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,500
Well, some people make
too little dopamine.

792
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,560
Some people make so
little dopamine that they

793
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,340
need prescription dopamine.

794
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,450
They need L-DOPA, people
with Parkinson's take L-DOPA

795
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,450
and other compounds to increase dopamine

796
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,950
because Parkinson's is associated
with deficits in movement,

797
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,690
starts as a tremor,

798
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,490
actually starts with some other
things that are interesting.

799
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,480
We'll talk about in a moment,

800
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,570
but Parkinson's is a depression.

801
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,070
It's a blunting of motivation

802
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,570
and mood and effect, and it's a tremor.

803
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,250
And then eventually in severe conditions

804
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,640
it's challenges in speaking and walking so

805
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,470
that some famous examples
would be Muhammad Ali,

806
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,330
Michael J. Fox, the great
boxing trainer, Freddie Roach,

807
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,030
like these people have
Parkinson's and they

808
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,810
at least later in their life
had challenges speaking.

809
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,949
Now it's not just fighters
that develop Parkinson's as far

810
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:54,279
as I know, Michael J.
Fox wasn't a fighter.

811
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,980
People can develop Parkinson's

812
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,690
and Parkinson's is a depletion

813
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,200
of dopamine neurons in the brain.

814
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
And it's not just movement challenges.

815
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,650
It's challenges with mood.

816
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,920
Now, hopefully most of you

817
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,970
all of you don't have Parkinson's,

818
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,389
but it's clear that dietary L-tyrosine

819
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:14,389
supports the healthy production
of things like dopamine

820
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,369
and as well as other
factors within the brain.

821
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,924
Now, some people immediately ask,

822
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:20,860
well should I supplement L-tyrosine?

823
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,050
So let's just talk about that

824
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,190
because that's gonna come up.

825
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,639
Full disclosure, I
sometimes take L-tyrosine.

826
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,679
I'm not taking it right now,

827
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,549
but I take it only occasionally,

828
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,580
you can buy this in capsule form.

829
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,600
It does increase kind of a mood
and elevation and alertness.

830
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,719
It is over the counter.

831
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,959
You have to check with your doctor.

832
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,469
I'm not responsible for your healthcare

833
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,009
and I'm not a doctor, whether
or not it's safe for you,

834
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,960
people with preexisting
hyper dopaminergic conditions

835
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,458
like mania should probably
not take L-tyrosine.

836
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,409
The other thing

837
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,099
about taking L-tyrosine
is there is a crash, okay?

838
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,909
It's not a massive crash if you take it

839
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,259
at appropriate doses
and it's right for you

840
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,060
but it can produce a crash and a lethargy

841
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,590
and a kind of brain fog
after the next day or so.

842
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:07,590
And so L-tyrosine however
can be ingested through foods

843
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,910
or through supplementation
to increase dopamine levels.

844
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,306
That's well-known, taken
chronically however,

845
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:14,940
it can disrupt those dopamine pathways.

846
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,100
Now there are other drugs
that will increase L-tyrosine

847
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,580
and dopamine as well.

848
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,660
But those are severe enough

849
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,720
that they generally tend to
have addictive properties.

850
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,190
So things like methamphetamine,

851
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,680
things like cocaine are terrible
because they really ramp

852
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,200
up the dopamine system so much

853
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,090
that people really can't
achieve dopamine release

854
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,700
through any other mechanisms.

855
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,170
But food and the ingestion

856
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,130
of L-tyrosine has a profound effect

857
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,541
on our levels of dopamine.

858
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,889
It takes a little while

859
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:43,430
but that really will impact level of mood.

860
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,696
Certain antidepressants fall

861
00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:48,050
into the category of
dopaminergic antidepressants.

862
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,060
One of the most famous ones
of course is Wellbutrin.

863
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,600
Wellbutrin with developed

864
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,649
because a lot of the other antidepressants

865
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:57,100
tend to make people feel kind of lethargic

866
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,900
or they had side effect profiles
that people didn't like.

867
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,120
So they developed this thing that,

868
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,100
the generic name is different,

869
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,780
but it's generally called Wellbutrin.

870
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,630
Wellbutrin activates dopamine

871
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,660
and epinephrin, which is
a substrate of dopamine.

872
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,800
And both of those are involved

873
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,420
in motivation and alertness and effort.

874
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,280
So you might say, wow, this
sounds like a great drug.

875
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,032
However, this drug,

876
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:20,560
the side effect profile
tends to be the things

877
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,020
that are associated with
elevated mood and alertness.

878
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,150
So this isn't like taking some L-tyrosine.

879
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,230
This isn't like eating
some tyrosine rich foods.

880
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,760
This is really a much greater release

881
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,650
of dopamine and epinephrin,
and it increases things

882
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,410
like anxiety, sweating, the pupils dilate.

883
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,060
It has certain effects
on, in particular people

884
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,120
with epilepsy, it's been
used somewhat successfully

885
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,420
for smoking cessation, but
again, it's not for everybody

886
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,130
and I'm not here to encourage
the use of these things.

887
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,500
I'm just describing the biology

888
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,700
and the rationale for why
these drugs were developed.

889
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,430
So let's back up a second.

890
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,070
Let's just kind of take
stock of where we're at.

891
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,600
We have a brain body connection.

892
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,940
There are many of them, but one

893
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,610
of the main ones is the vagus nerve.

894
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,110
The vagus collects information

895
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,060
about a lot of things,
breathing, heart rate stuff

896
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,030
that's happening in the gut, et cetera,

897
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,460
and gut by the way, includes
the stomach and the intestines,

898
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,750
sends that information up to the brain.

899
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,440
The brain is using that information

900
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,170
to decide one of two things,

901
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,660
move toward something or move away.

902
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,670
It can also pause,

903
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,500
but essentially pausing
is not moving toward.

904
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,760
So that's the dopamine
pathway and foods rich

905
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,550
in L-tyrosine generally
give us an elevated mood

906
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,930
and make us want to do more

907
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,390
of whatever it is that we
happen to be doing as well

908
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,260
as other things, motivation, generalizes

909
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,290
to other things it's not
unique to just ingesting foods

910
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,300
but foods that give us a big pulse

911
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,615
of dopamine will make us
crave more of that food.

912
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,080
It will make us crave more

913
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,950
of the activity that led to
the ingestion of that food.

914
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,320
And as I mentioned earlier,
a lot of that is happening

915
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,150
at a subconscious level that
you're not even aware of.

916
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,076
And this is why I think the
concern about hidden sugars

917
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:57,880
and over ingestion of sugars

918
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,084
is serious because it's not just

919
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,793
that the sugars are impacting

920
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:04,210
our blood glucose in negative ways.

921
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,420
Although often it is,

922
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,290
it's not just the obesity
crisis that's happening.

923
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,300
It's also the fact

924
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,260
that it's disrupting our dopamine systems.

925
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,390
Now that doesn't mean all sugar is bad.

926
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,460
Some people have a quite
healthy relationship to sugar

927
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,120
but I think most people are just not aware

928
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,030
that sugar isn't just
operating at the level

929
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,720
of taste it's operating at the level

930
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,980
of neurochemicals and it's
doing it subconsciously.

931
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,160
So I'd like to talk about
some of the other pathways

932
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,750
between brain and body that
regulate our moods and emotions

933
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,309
but also are actionable.

934
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,435
So the other neuromodulator
that's really interesting

935
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:39,320
in the context of the vagus is serotonin.

936
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,720
Serotonin, just to remind
you is a neuromodulator

937
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,190
therefore it creates a bias
in which neural circuits

938
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,180
which neurons in the brain and
body are going to be active

939
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,080
and it makes it less likely the other ones

940
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,040
are going to be active.

941
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,268
I think it's fair to say
without ever having measured it

942
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:58,947
that my bulldog Costello, just his brain

943
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,530
and body must be swimming in serotonin,

944
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,660
because he's very calm and he eats a lot

945
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,340
but he generally feels pretty sated.

946
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,720
He's kind of an animal that's
obsessed with comforts.

947
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,850
He's a bit of a hedonist, and
serotonin when it's elevated

948
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,140
tends to make us feel really comfortable

949
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,030
and kind of blissed out wherever we are.

950
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,490
And that contrast with
dopamine and epinephrin

951
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,210
which mainly put us in pursuit of things.

952
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,290
Motivation is pursuit.

953
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,750
Serotonin is more about
feeling really comfy

954
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:30,583
where we are.

955
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:34,900
The conversation around the
brain body relationship and mood

956
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,920
and serotonin for many years
was, well, you eat a big meal.

957
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,040
The gut is distended.

958
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,340
You've got all the nutrients you need

959
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,870
you rest and digest and
serotonin is released.

960
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,985
That's sorta true, but
there's a lot more going

961
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,776
on and a lot more that's interesting

962
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:51,100
and actionable that's going on.

963
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,920
First of all, some of you,

964
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,120
but perhaps not all have heard that more

965
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,080
than 90% of the serotonin
that we make is in our gut.

966
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,900
And indeed we have a lot
of serotonin in our gut.

967
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,210
We have neurons in our
gut that makes serotonin.

968
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,960
We have neurons in our
brain that make serotonin,

969
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
but here's the deal.

970
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,590
Most of the serotonin
that impacts our mood

971
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,620
and our mental state is not in our gut.

972
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,249
Most of it is in the neurons of the brain

973
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:19,090
in an area called the
raphae nucleus of the brain,

974
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,890
there are a few other locations too,

975
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,360
and those are the neurons that control

976
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,740
whether or not we feel satiated or not.

977
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,451
Whether or not we feel happy and calm.

978
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,820
You can't have a
discussion about serotonin

979
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,430
without having discussion
about antidepressants.

980
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,450
Because during the late
eighties and early nineties

981
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,920
there was this explosion

982
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,470
in the number of prescription
drugs that were released.

983
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,760
Things like first one and most
famous one is Prozac, Zoloft

984
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,300
and Paxil, a number of other
ones that are so-called SSRI

985
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,443
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.

986
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,760
That's a long acronym, but
basically those drugs work

987
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,760
by preventing the gobbling
up of serotonin or re-uptake

988
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,430
of serotonin into neurons
after it's been released

989
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,600
which leads to more serotonin overall

990
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,150
which means to elevate serotonin.

991
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:11,240
And indeed those drugs
were and can be very useful

992
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,130
for certain people to feel better in cases

993
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,130
of depression and some other
clinical disorders as well.

994
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,180
So I really don't want to dismiss them

995
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,720
as useless or dangerous for everybody.

996
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,660
They can be quite useful for many people.

997
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,540
Not everyone responds well to them

998
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,180
as I'm sure you've all heard.

999
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,760
And their side effect profile has affects

1000
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,820
like blunting affect.

1001
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,160
It can make people feel kind of flat,

1002
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,830
kinda meh, it can reduce
appetite for food.

1003
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,350
It can reduce appetite for sex.

1004
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,440
It can do all sorts of things,
or it can work really well.

1005
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,770
Sometimes it's a dose-related
issue, et cetera.

1006
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,050
Serotonin is fascinating however,

1007
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,470
because how well those neurons

1008
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,920
in the raphe work is impacted
by some events within the gut.

1009
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,150
Although you might be surprised to find

1010
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,320
out what those events are.

1011
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,130
So let's go a little
bit deeper into the gut.

1012
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,780
And again, the gut includes the stomach

1013
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,900
and then the small intestine
in the large intestine

1014
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,946
and ask like, what is going
on with serotonin in the gut?

1015
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,633
How is it impacting
serotonin in the brain?

1016
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,010
And let's think about this in the context

1017
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,520
of how some of us might want to increase

1018
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,330
or decrease our serotonin levels.

1019
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,330
So as far as I know, there
aren't any really good

1020
00:42:25,353 --> 00:42:29,280
at home blood tests for things
like serotonin and dopamine.

1021
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,940
There's some commercial
products out there.

1022
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,950
But to me, just to me, I'm
not particularly impressed.

1023
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,783
You know, it's not the same

1024
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:37,990
as getting your hormones levels measured

1025
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,280
or your metabolic factors
measured, that's can be daunting.

1026
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,981
It can be done rigorously.

1027
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,470
There are tests out there.

1028
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,010
There are even some, believe it or not.

1029
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,700
There's some questionnaires that,

1030
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,460
and I think actually
last year it made some

1031
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,580
of the bigger newspapers,

1032
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,830
are you more of a dopamine or a serotonin?

1033
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,320
Are you a this or that?

1034
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,860
I find that stuff to be a little silly

1035
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,190
although I do appreciate,
and like the fact

1036
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,640
that people are thinking about and talking

1037
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,390
about neuromodulators there aren't really

1038
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,730
great ways to measure these
things outside the clinic.

1039
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,870
There's some great clinical
tools that you can get inside

1040
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,970
of a hospital or from a
proper endocrinologist

1041
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,430
or neurologist, but no great at-home tool.

1042
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,650
So maybe that's a call to arms

1043
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,900
for some of you entrepreneurial folks

1044
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,160
out there to create these
tests, accurate tests please,

1045
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,720
that could be done at home.

1046
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,680
But some people feel
like they're too anxious

1047
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,960
or they're always in a motivated state

1048
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,710
and they're trying to
adjust their serotonin.

1049
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,020
Many people adjust their
serotonin by just eating more food

1050
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,180
and carbohydrate rich foods
will increase serotonin.

1051
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,970
I've talked about this
on a previous podcast

1052
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,140
but I personally am a big fan

1053
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,580
at least for me is I usually fast

1054
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,830
and exercise in the early part of the day

1055
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,830
I eat a relatively high protein
and moderate fat zero carb

1056
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,500
or low carb meal at lunch in
the afternoon to stay alert

1057
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,790
because those foods tend to
favor dopamine production

1058
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,980
acetylcholine production,

1059
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,000
epinephrin production and alertness.

1060
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,520
My mood is generally pretty
good most of the time.

1061
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,030
And then as evening comes
around and I'm concerned

1062
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,735
about sleep and a good
night's sleep, not concerned

1063
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:11,670
in an anxious way, but I want
to get a good night's sleep.

1064
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:14,640
I will ingest foods that
promote serotonin release

1065
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,550
because they contain a lot of tryptophan.

1066
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,530
So if I do eat meat,

1067
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,130
it would be like a
white meat, turkey meat.

1068
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,530
I don't tend to, I've never liked turkey.

1069
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,570
I don't mind the animal

1070
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,602
but I don't like ingesting the meat,

1071
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:28,890
but starchy carbohydrates
will increase serotonin.

1072
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,250
Some people also will take serotonin.

1073
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,945
You can now buy 5-HTP supplements.

1074
00:44:34,945 --> 00:44:36,387
This is a little bit tricky.

1075
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:40,750
5-HTP supplements can of
course increase 5-HTP.

1076
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,196
It is 5-HTP or serotonin

1077
00:44:43,196 --> 00:44:46,400
but that sometimes can create problems

1078
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,700
in endogenous or self-made
production of serotonin.

1079
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,870
So I'm never a fan

1080
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,470
of taking things very
close to the chemical

1081
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,990
you're trying to increase for
very long periods of time.

1082
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,840
Maybe for occasional use.

1083
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,070
I have the problem that

1084
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,880
if I take serotonin supplements,
5-HTP, I fall asleep.

1085
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,170
The sleep I have is very intense

1086
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,670
and I wake up three or four hours later.

1087
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,130
And we know based on sleep
studies with good measurements

1088
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,070
in the lab that serotonin
release tends to be

1089
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,570
in the later part of the night.

1090
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,240
And so by taking it early in the night

1091
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,880
it really can disrupt the pattern

1092
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,490
of sleep in the depth of sleep.

1093
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,580
Nonetheless, some people are interested

1094
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,920
in taking serotonin to get some

1095
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,470
of the more blissed out effects.

1096
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,280
You can achieve that with foods.

1097
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,048
As I mentioned, that
are carbohydrate rich.

1098
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:28,370
So as you're seeing this

1099
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,450
isn't really a discussion
about nutrition per se.

1100
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,625
This is discussion about food

1101
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:34,560
which contains amino acids, amino acids

1102
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,620
being the precursors to
neuromodulators and neuromodulators

1103
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,940
having a profound effect
on your overall state

1104
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,470
of alertness or calmness,
happiness, sadness, and wellbeing.

1105
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,650
So there are a number of
things that one can take.

1106
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,190
As I mentioned, one of
them being 5-HTP itself.

1107
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,178
Now I'm not recommending
people take anything,

1108
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:53,520
but if you're interested

1109
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,680
in what this does and
you want to explore this

1110
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,800
of course you'd want
permission from your doctor.

1111
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,161
You can go to this free website.

1112
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:01,638
I love this resource.

1113
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:03,100
They don't pay me to say that,

1114
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,710
but I just love this resource.

1115
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,800
I've followed it for a long
time called examine.com.

1116
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,670
Thank you folks at examine.com

1117
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,880
for putting this free resource

1118
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,570
out on the web that has links

1119
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,070
through what they call
the human effect matrix.

1120
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:16,903
So it's links

1121
00:46:16,903 --> 00:46:19,230
to all the PubMed studies
for particular effects

1122
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,980
of particular compounds that one combined

1123
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,960
and just incredible as well
as important health warnings.

1124
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,210
So I'm not gonna read through everything

1125
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,770
but if you were to go to
examine.com as I have now

1126
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,330
and you put in 5-HTP

1127
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,600
they're only looking at things
that have strong evidence.

1128
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,240
PubMed articles,

1129
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,540
articles that are in the PubMed archive.

1130
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,550
So for instance, I didn't know this,

1131
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,030
but 5-HTP produces a notable
decrease in appetite,

1132
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,400
three studies.

1133
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,050
And this appetite suppression
makes sense, of course,

1134
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,480
because we ingest foods to get serotonin.

1135
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,869
And if we have enough serotonin

1136
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:55,730
then there's no reason
to ingest more foods.

1137
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,464
It tends to have a blunting of appetite.

1138
00:46:58,464 --> 00:46:59,670
It probably does that also
through other mechanisms.

1139
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,190
So I'm not saying you should do this

1140
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,140
but if someone's trying to blunt

1141
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,770
their appetite could
be a interesting route,

1142
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,833
although I don't recommend chronic use,

1143
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,770
not surprisingly there's
a decrease in body weight

1144
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,160
as a consequence, an increase in cortisol.

1145
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,980
So that's kind of important to note

1146
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,790
that when you typically
in biology, if you pull

1147
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,620
on one string really
hard and other one moves

1148
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,230
it's a little bit like a puppet in there.

1149
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,140
It's more than one string on the puppet.

1150
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,660
So it does seem to
increase cortisol though

1151
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,900
they report as a minor effect.

1152
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,483
Again, links to all those are there

1153
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:32,510
which is why I'm not listing
them out in our caption notes.

1154
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,310
You can go and get them at examine.com,

1155
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,720
put in serotonin and you'll find that.

1156
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,795
So I find it fascinating

1157
00:47:38,795 --> 00:47:42,160
that nowadays there are
things that are somewhere

1158
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,990
between doing nothing, getting serotonin

1159
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,620
from tryptophan and foods
and prescription drugs.

1160
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,060
There's this other category

1161
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,390
of supplements that are really interesting

1162
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,260
for modulating these
chemicals in the body.

1163
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,220
And I should mention before I move on,

1164
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,720
because I mentioned L-tyrosine

1165
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:00,540
I neglected to mention earlier

1166
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,670
in our discussion about
dopamine, if you're interested

1167
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,600
in the dopamine pathway,
go to examine.com,

1168
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,600
put in Mucuna pruriens, it's M-U-C-U-N-A,

1169
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:16,023
separate word, P-R-U-R-I-E-N S.

1170
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,100
It is a velvet bean that grows from vines

1171
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,490
and is very itchy to touch due
to serotonin on its surface.

1172
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,930
Amazing, this bean has
serotonin on its surface

1173
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,460
and indeed serotonin at
if you were to put it

1174
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,670
on your skin would cause

1175
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,650
some irritation of the skin, amazing.

1176
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,650
Inside the bean is L-DOPA,
Mucuna pruriens is not

1177
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,660
just something that
promotes dopamine release

1178
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,511
because of some weird mystical

1179
00:48:41,511 --> 00:48:44,570
ancient thing or whatever, or sorcery.

1180
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,360
It is chemically L-DOPA
the precursor to dopamine.

1181
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,520
It contains some other molecules as well

1182
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,850
and low levels of other psychoactives.

1183
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,630
This stuff is available over the counter.

1184
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,238
Incredible. I personally
find it incredible.

1185
00:48:58,238 --> 00:49:00,620
Its effects are really interesting.

1186
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,980
I'm not gonna read them all off

1187
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,500
but I mentioned these effects

1188
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,270
not because I'm encouraging you to take it

1189
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,810
but because you get a window

1190
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,380
into what dopamine, acute
dopamine increase does

1191
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,890
in the non-Parkinsonian context.

1192
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,070
And you can start to think
about foods that are rich

1193
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:20,070
in L-tyrosine as biasing
certain effects or not others.

1194
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,450
So when you hear food is medicine,

1195
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,370
food isn't really medicine.

1196
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,930
Food is food, but food has
these chemical effects as well.

1197
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,260
So first one listed is three studies

1198
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,260
with very high rigor that
overall have a minor effect

1199
00:49:35,026 --> 00:49:37,340
on of all things, sperm quality.

1200
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,345
So it appears that sperm motility itself,

1201
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:42,221
I'm assuming when they say sperm quality

1202
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:44,075
I don't know what features
of sperm of quality

1203
00:49:44,075 --> 00:49:45,083
they looked at with sperm,

1204
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:45,916
that's not discussion I want to have,

1205
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,280
but I'm assuming it's motility

1206
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,970
because I know enough
about reproductive biology

1207
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,390
to know that sperm ability to swim depends

1208
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,880
on some proteins that are present

1209
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,610
in the front of the sperm, et cetera

1210
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,430
things like contractions
and sperm motility

1211
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,140
is generally associated
with sperm quality.

1212
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,640
Sperm that don't move are
generally not very useful sperm.

1213
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,302
Symptoms of Parkinson disease are

1214
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:10,240
are notably degraded with Mucuna pruriens.

1215
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,150
So fascinating. That's not surprising.

1216
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,880
And there are a lot of other effects here.

1217
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,450
Feelings of subjective wellbeing,

1218
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,880
testosterone, reductions in
prolactin, not surprising.

1219
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,060
Prolactin is a hormone that's involved

1220
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,550
in milk letdown, it's
in lactating mothers.

1221
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,690
It's involved in feelings
of peace and generally

1222
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:33,300
is antagonistic to sexual
desire in both men and female.

1223
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,230
So it's really interesting that
things like Mucuna pruriens

1224
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,300
which are L-DOPA reduce prolactin,
increased sperm motility,

1225
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,210
increased testosterone,
subjective wellbeing.

1226
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,040
So you're starting to see a theme, right?

1227
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,240
Dopamine really makes us motivated.

1228
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,260
Feel in pursuit, makes us feel good.

1229
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,800
Serotonin makes us feel
more relaxed and calm.

1230
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,520
Now this whole month is about emotion.

1231
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,990
So you might be thinking, well, wait

1232
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,280
where are we going with all
this as it relates to emotions.

1233
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,040
But in the last episode I said something

1234
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,893
I'm gonna repeat it now
briefly, which is that much

1235
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,090
of what we talk about is good
emotions or bad emotions.

1236
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,310
There's a context to that.

1237
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,720
There's a social context.

1238
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,430
We can't really say an
emotion is good or bad.

1239
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,731
Grieving at a funeral is healthy.

1240
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:16,530
Being happy at a funeral,

1241
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,620
assuming you loved the person that died

1242
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,620
is most people probably
wouldn't think that was healthy.

1243
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,273
So we can't really say that certain

1244
00:51:23,273 --> 00:51:26,890
emotions like sadness or
happiness are healthy.

1245
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,200
It's context is important.

1246
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,970
Cultural context is important.

1247
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,960
Many of you have asked
for book recommendations.

1248
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,140
This is an opportunity to raise
a mention of another book.

1249
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,310
Again, I don't have any
financial affiliation or anything

1250
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,330
but if you want to read
more about emotions

1251
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,410
and how the context and cultural
things impact our emotions

1252
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,727
I'm a huge fan of Lisa Feldman Barrett.

1253
00:51:46,727 --> 00:51:49,343
I learned about her from
the Lex Fridman Podcast.

1254
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,750
I've had discussions with
her on my Instagram Live,

1255
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,380
she's at Northeastern University,

1256
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,090
a world expert in emotions.

1257
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,460
Her first book is "How Emotions Are Made"

1258
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,620
This is not a book she sent me.

1259
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,670
I paid for this with
my own money years ago,

1260
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:05,780
bought it, read it, loved
it long before I met Lisa,

1261
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,613
I'm just delighted

1262
00:52:06,613 --> 00:52:08,100
that we've got to known
each other a little bit.

1263
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,370
It's a really interesting
read into the psychology

1264
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,760
of emotions and some of the
subjectivity of emotions.

1265
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,513
So, whereas I'm talking about
mainly the biology of emotions

1266
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:18,867
this gets a little bit
more into the psychology

1267
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:21,200
and the biology as well.

1268
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,250
And Lisa's just terrific.

1269
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,083
She's also putting a lot

1270
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,900
of information out into
the world about emotion.

1271
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,731
So if you want to learn more about that

1272
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:32,060
check out her work, again,
it's Lisa Feldman Barrett.

1273
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,762
And that book is "How Emotions Are Made"

1274
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,312
Hopefully she'll continue
to write many more books.

1275
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,330
So now you understand the relationship

1276
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:46,240
I hope between foods and
dopamine, foods and serotonin

1277
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,950
and that they're both being communicated

1278
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,670
to the brain via the vagus, right?

1279
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,140
We ingest these foods,

1280
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,120
these supplements are things people take,

1281
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,560
they don't put them
directly into the brain.

1282
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,470
They put them in our gut.

1283
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,690
So yes, there's a gut brain connection

1284
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,910
but it's not about the serotonin

1285
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,190
in the gut that makes
you feel calm and placid.

1286
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,413
It's not about the dopamine in the gut.

1287
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,810
It's just been oversold that way

1288
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,760
because I think there's
something really attractive.

1289
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,627
And I understand about the idea

1290
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:17,700
that because certain
things about our experience

1291
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,660
of life and our emotions
is happening in our body.

1292
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,770
That maybe we have a
little more control, right?

1293
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,440
Because this thing is a hard container.

1294
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,390
We can't just stuff
some dopamine in there.

1295
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,790
I could probably take
a Mucuna pruriens bean

1296
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,590
and stuff it in my ear,
please don't do that.

1297
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,530
It'd make my ear itchy

1298
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,000
because of the serotonin on the outside.

1299
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,223
But you can't get stuff in there.

1300
00:53:34,223 --> 00:53:37,200
What you have to do is ingest
things that are metabolized

1301
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,769
in certain ways that
communicate to the brain

1302
00:53:39,769 --> 00:53:43,340
or so maybe they pass
into the brain themselves

1303
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,720
across what's called
the blood brain barrier.

1304
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,330
I'll talk about the blood
brain barrier in a minute.

1305
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,830
It's actually called the BBB.

1306
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,833
So it ends up sounding like baby, BBB.

1307
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,154
I guess that's like BB, anyway,

1308
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:59,350
BBB, but they're also nerves

1309
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,730
in the gut that are sensing
the nutrient contents of food

1310
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,210
and then saying, oh, you should
feel better and want more.

1311
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:09,910
Oh, that's got a lot of
bitterness and acid taste to it.

1312
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,784
You should want less of that.

1313
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:13,310
So as I transitioned out

1314
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,910
of the discussion about dopamine
and serotonin in the gut

1315
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,210
hopefully you've got some
actionable items there

1316
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,420
under your belt, pun intended,

1317
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,010
where you can understand how certain foods

1318
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,843
and certain nutrients

1319
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:27,870
and you can look these up,
might impact your mood.

1320
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,660
If you're somebody who's really
anxious and really wired.

1321
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,930
Well, then the dopamine adrenaline pathway

1322
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,720
epinephrine pathway is
probably not one that you

1323
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,930
want to lean on any harder.

1324
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,360
If you tend to be someone
who's pretty passive

1325
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,790
and you're having trouble with motivation.

1326
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,030
Well then think about ramping

1327
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,540
up the dopamine pathway through,
I always think behaviors

1328
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,240
and proper food choices
is the best way to start.

1329
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,380
And behaviors include things
like exercise, et cetera.

1330
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,360
But one of the problems

1331
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,362
with the discussion
around mood and exercise

1332
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:59,520
or mood and meditation is
that it's so subjective.

1333
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,950
It's like, I love certain forms
of exercise and not others.

1334
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,370
Certain ones are aversive to me.

1335
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,040
Certain ones are attractive to me,

1336
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,040
and it's never really clear.

1337
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,873
No one's ever told me.

1338
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:09,250
Okay, you have to do 10 minutes

1339
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,010
on the bike at X number
of RPM at so-and-so

1340
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,500
or on the skier in order
to get your dopamine up.

1341
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,710
But we can actually say, if
you ingest more L-tyrosine

1342
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,430
there's a high probability
that you're going

1343
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,280
to make more dopamine.

1344
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,190
And I'm talking about ingesting it

1345
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,500
through food or through
supplementation if you like.

1346
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,310
Mucuna pruriens, I've tried.

1347
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:30,430
I should just mention it
was too dopaminergic for me.

1348
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,310
I got really, really jazzed up

1349
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:36,580
and then a severe crash
for me the next day.

1350
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,360
But that's, I think because
I tend to ride pretty high

1351
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,360
on the kind of alertness
and motivation scale.

1352
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,180
I'm always being told by
Costello and other people

1353
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,680
in the podcast studio
to slow my speech down.

1354
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,616
This is me uncaffeinated,
and I could probably

1355
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:51,800
afford a little more serotonin in my life.

1356
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,232
So, whereas Costello,

1357
00:55:54,232 --> 00:55:57,490
he can afford to wake
up every couple of days

1358
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:58,690
and just say hello to us.

1359
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,560
This dog sleeps more
than any other creature.

1360
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,693
It's remarkable.

1361
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:07,010
So there are things that we
can do and they're actionable.

1362
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,570
And they are in some
ways they're quantitative

1363
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,140
because you can regulate dosages

1364
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,540
and you can regulate amounts
and you can regulate timing.

1365
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,840
And everyone has to play with these things

1366
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,420
and figure out what's right
for them in terms of feeding.

1367
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,720
And everyone has to explore

1368
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,810
and understand what's
safe and right for them.

1369
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,050
But, and of course, exercise
is still very important.

1370
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,350
I talked about social
connection in the last episode

1371
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,211
super important for
activation of serotonin

1372
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:32,752
but when it comes to this gut brain,

1373
00:56:32,752 --> 00:56:36,470
body brain relationship,
what we eat really matters

1374
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,010
in terms of the
neurochemicals that we make.

1375
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,860
So let's talk a little bit more
about things that we ingest

1376
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,978
in our body and then allow
our body to inform our brain

1377
00:56:44,978 --> 00:56:46,320
to shift our mood.

1378
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,840
And this is something
I've been doing for years.

1379
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,140
And I just want to say

1380
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,600
I've found to be a complete game changer.

1381
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,832
There's excellent science to support it.

1382
00:56:54,832 --> 00:56:58,100
And I think most people are familiar

1383
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,140
with it in a different context

1384
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,490
but I don't think most
people know this simple fact

1385
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:08,490
which is that the omega-3
to omega-6 fatty acid ratio

1386
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,650
has a profound effect on depression.

1387
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,937
It has a profound effect
on mood so much so

1388
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:20,080
that in a double-blind
placebo controlled study

1389
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,260
that I will provide the link too,

1390
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:23,330
this was a study first published in 2008

1391
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,230
but there've been many others as well.

1392
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:29,750
First of all, an
experiment done in animals.

1393
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,050
They found there's a model

1394
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:33,560
of learned helplessness in animals.

1395
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,285
It's not very kind to the animals,

1396
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,713
but they put rats or mice in a jar.

1397
00:57:36,713 --> 00:57:38,260
They let them swim and they'll swim, swim,

1398
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,341
swim to try and save their life.

1399
00:57:40,341 --> 00:57:41,500
And eventually they give up,
it's a learned helplessness.

1400
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,693
They don't let them
drown, they take them out.

1401
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,310
Adjusting the omega-3 omega-6 ratio so

1402
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:51,010
that the omega-3's are higher led to less

1403
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,660
learned helplessness,
meaning these animals

1404
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,880
would swim longer.

1405
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,860
Now that's an animal.

1406
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,923
That's a rat, not a
particularly kind study,

1407
00:57:56,923 --> 00:58:01,490
but that same study was
essentially done in humans

1408
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,230
although they didn't have
them swim to the point

1409
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,530
of near drowning.

1410
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:08,600
What they did is they took
people who were clinically

1411
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,640
depressed, major depression.

1412
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,161
Major depression is
severe maladaptive state

1413
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:16,735
meaning it inhibits job,
relationships, appetite,

1414
00:58:16,735 --> 00:58:19,823
all sorts of negative health effects.

1415
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,218
And they did a comparison of

1416
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:26,350
a thousand milligrams a day of EPA.

1417
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:30,470
So EPA is one of the elements
that contains high levels

1418
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:32,770
of omega-3's that's in
things like fish oil,

1419
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,100
I'll talk about other
sources in a little bit

1420
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,540
but it wasn't a thousand
milligrams of fish oil.

1421
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,810
It was a thousand milligrams of EPA.

1422
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,420
Compared that to 20
milligrams of Fluoxetine

1423
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,520
which is Prozac, okay.

1424
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,460
Really increases serotonin.

1425
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,780
And in this study of
60 individuals, again,

1426
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,719
I'll provide the links to the study.

1427
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:59,135
They found that they
were equally effective

1428
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,290
in reducing depressive symptoms.

1429
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,481
So imagine that,

1430
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:07,481
a food-based compound that
you can't make without,

1431
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,330
right, this is not a situation

1432
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,010
where you can make your own omega-3s.

1433
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,390
You have to get them from food sources

1434
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:16,220
or from supplementation, was
as effective as 20 milligrams

1435
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,400
of fluoxetine over the
course of eight weeks.

1436
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,727
And what was really
interesting in addition

1437
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,027
to that is that the combination
of a thousand milligrams

1438
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:28,530
of EPA and Fluoxetine
had a synergistic effect

1439
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,350
in lowering depressive symptoms.

1440
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,570
I find this remarkable.

1441
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,880
I heard about this when it first came

1442
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,070
out and I wasn't sure what to make of it.

1443
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,369
'Cause there are a lot
of studies that come out

1444
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:41,780
and I generally like to
focus my changes in behavior

1445
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,760
around things where there's
a large center of mass.

1446
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,213
There's a lot of information.

1447
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,666
A couple years later, I did in fact

1448
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:50,360
start taking a thousand milligrams

1449
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,340
per day of EPA in fish oil.

1450
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,490
Now there are a few side
effects of fish oil.

1451
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:59,860
People who have blood, who are bleeders

1452
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,320
who have Factor V Leiden mutations

1453
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,660
or in women who are taking birth control,

1454
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,740
which can affect blood clotting and things

1455
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,380
of that sort really
should talk to your doctor

1456
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,120
make sure it's okay for you.

1457
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,930
Fish oil also can give people fishy breath

1458
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,100
which is pretty gross, frankly,

1459
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,830
but there are now fish oils that

1460
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,233
either because of the
Encapsulations or because

1461
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:25,000
they put some lemon flavoring in there

1462
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,660
doesn't have that effect.

1463
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,090
In any event, a thousand
milligrams per day of EPA.

1464
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,760
I started ingesting that regularly.

1465
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,670
I just felt better.

1466
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,661
I wasn't clinically
depressed, but I generally,

1467
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:37,820
I did feel at least for me, an
increase in mood and affect.

1468
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,090
And a number of other things

1469
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,380
it's supposed to reduce inflammation.

1470
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,370
The cardiovascular
effects are controversial

1471
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,740
for a long time everyone
thought the effects

1472
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,110
on platelets were really terrific.

1473
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,150
Then there were articles that came

1474
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,700
out in major newspapers
saying maybe not so much

1475
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,850
but the effects on mood
are really profound.

1476
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,170
And now there are lots of studies.

1477
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:57,510
If you go into PubMed

1478
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:01,310
and you were to put EPA
or fish oil and depression

1479
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,090
you would find that there were a number

1480
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,010
of really impressive results showing

1481
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,750
that it's at least as effective

1482
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,173
as certain SSRI antidepressants
at these dosages

1483
01:01:10,173 --> 01:01:13,860
and it can amplify or improve the effect

1484
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,310
of low dosages of some of these SSRIs.

1485
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,260
So I feel like more people
should know about this.

1486
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,270
This is nutrition, but it's
profoundly affecting mood

1487
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,190
and depression is terrible, right?

1488
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,880
Depression can have a component

1489
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,240
of anxiety in some cases where people are

1490
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,358
they feel lousy and very uncertain.

1491
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:32,750
That's kind of how I talk
about depression with anxiety

1492
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,550
is you talk to someone who is anxious

1493
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,320
and you can tell them
everything's gonna be okay.

1494
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,460
And they're always concerned

1495
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,410
about what they might not know.

1496
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,340
You don't really know the
plane isn't gonna crash.

1497
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,920
You don't really know that
life is gonna go okay.

1498
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,980
And in some sense, they're right,

1499
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,410
no one has a crystal ball
or can predict the future,

1500
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:50,980
but they tend to perseverate
or fixate on the uncertainty.

1501
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,450
And then of course there are the versions

1502
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,120
of depression that involve certainty.

1503
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,340
People are lethargic and
they're certain they say, yeah,

1504
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm certain, I'm never
gonna get another job.

1505
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,620
I'm certain, I'm never
gonna meet anyone new.

1506
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,770
I'm certain I'm gonna fail.

1507
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,960
So there's this kind of
a divide in the sphere

1508
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,870
of depression around
certainty and uncertainty.

1509
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:10,710
But what's interesting is this
thousand milligrams per day

1510
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,910
or more of EPA has been shown

1511
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:16,330
to relieve both forms of depression.

1512
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:18,530
Now, does that mean it's
gonna work for everybody?

1513
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,690
No, I'm not here to try
and play psychiatrist.

1514
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,550
I want to point you in the
direction of these manuscripts

1515
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:26,190
so that you can make informed
choices for yourself.

1516
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,610
You can discuss it with your doctor

1517
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,460
and family and make the
choices that are right for you.

1518
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,580
But here's what's especially interesting

1519
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,510
about the heart effects,

1520
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,900
because we've heard that these omega-3s,

1521
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,920
which of course you can
get from other sources too,

1522
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,280
you can get from fatty fish,

1523
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,883
they're in flax seeds, hemp seeds.

1524
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,458
There are a number of chia
seeds, these kinds of things

1525
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:51,360
but the levels of EPA that
are required are quite high.

1526
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,560
So this thousand milligrams

1527
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,180
per day is that's pretty
hard to get from food

1528
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,380
although it can be done depending

1529
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,523
on what you're eating.

1530
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:03,490
What's interesting is that the
heart effects that are solid

1531
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,411
that really stand up in the literature

1532
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:06,950
have a lot more to do

1533
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,840
with something we talked
about in a previous episode.

1534
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,670
And I'll mention again, which
is heart rate variability.

1535
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,020
So we know that having a
heart rate that's really high

1536
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,630
or heart rate, that's really low.

1537
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,880
Neither of those are good.

1538
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,713
A lot of people think, oh

1539
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:20,126
you just want a low heart
rate, big stroke volume.

1540
01:03:20,126 --> 01:03:22,090
You know, if you're running a lot

1541
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,210
you may have 30 or 40 beats per minute.

1542
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,500
That's great to be in shape

1543
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,221
but you still want heart rate variability.

1544
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,360
It has a lot to do with the tone

1545
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,190
of the autonomic nervous
system talked about last time.

1546
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,310
How, when you inhale,
it speeds up heart rate.

1547
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,890
When you exhale, it decreases heart rate.

1548
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,640
That's called respiratory
sinus arrhythmia.

1549
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,300
That's the basis of
heart rate variability.

1550
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,530
We'll maybe do a short post about this.

1551
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,370
So you can get all the mechanism

1552
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,520
and the behaviors that spill

1553
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,240
out of that that might be useful for you.

1554
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,050
But the point is heart rate variability.

1555
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,800
HRV is good.

1556
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,870
And what's interesting
is that there was a study

1557
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:58,870
in 2009 that showed that people
who eat a diet where they

1558
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,250
fail to supplement in a way that there's

1559
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,270
a high omega-6 to three ratio,

1560
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:06,660
so not enough omega-3s,
not only are there markers

1561
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,047
of an inflammatory cytokines,
elevated things like IL-6

1562
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,540
and TNF-alpha,

1563
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,573
but they tend to be
non-responders to antidepressants.

1564
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,390
Shifting that omega-3 omega-6

1565
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,930
ratio did a couple things.

1566
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,950
First of all, increasing the amount

1567
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,810
of EPA shifted the ratio.

1568
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:27,520
So it was higher omega-3 to
omega-6 ratio, which was good,

1569
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,410
lowered the inflammation markers,

1570
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:32,440
and then allowed antidepressants
to have their effect,

1571
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,040
even at low doses.

1572
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,100
And here's the really interesting thing.

1573
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:40,070
It worked by increasing
heart rate variability,

1574
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,730
and you think, well, how in
the world would this happen?

1575
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:45,280
But you know how I mean,
that's a ton of effects

1576
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,230
but the way it works is because
of the way that these things

1577
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:52,020
are impacting the gut and
the autonomic nervous system.

1578
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,240
Remember earlier, I said, the
vagus includes connections

1579
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,830
from the heart signaling
about sensory information

1580
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,400
about how fast the heart
is beating to the brain

1581
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,902
not just stuff on the lungs,
but information from the heart

1582
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,430
and the brain then adjusts heart rate

1583
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:07,170
by heart rate variability.

1584
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,730
So it's incredible that
there's a way that one

1585
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:13,877
can use the gut, the ingestion
of more of these EPA's,

1586
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,857
either through food or supplementation

1587
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:18,182
to increase rate variability

1588
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:21,905
and thereby to improve symptoms,

1589
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:25,110
meaning reduce symptoms of depression,

1590
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:28,590
and to even make low
levels of antidepressants

1591
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,500
that wouldn't otherwise work work.

1592
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,680
And I think I like this study so much

1593
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,450
because a, it's super cool.

1594
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,180
It bridges the brain body access.

1595
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,460
It incorporates nutrition and
micronutrients in the brain

1596
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,120
but also because it
really points to something

1597
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,500
that we hear all the time,

1598
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,180
which is our body is a whole system.

1599
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,290
It's working as a whole system
and the brain isn't working

1600
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:49,440
in isolation up there in the skull.

1601
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,830
It's reacting to things that
are happening in the body

1602
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:54,420
in the gut and in the heart
rate and heart rate variability.

1603
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,137
And that the things we ingest can have

1604
01:05:57,137 --> 01:05:57,970
a profound effect on them.

1605
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:00,290
Now, of course, I really
want to emphasize something

1606
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:04,830
which is that no one compound or nutrient

1607
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:08,610
or supplement or drug or
behavior for that matter

1608
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,430
is going to be the be all end all

1609
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,870
of shifting out of depression

1610
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,800
or improving one's mood
or improving sleep.

1611
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,400
It's a constellation of things.

1612
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,180
And this is especially true

1613
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,760
when people start to get excited
about supplements and drugs

1614
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,330
of all kinds and their
potential for various things.

1615
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:27,530
Right now, there's a lot of
excitement about psychedelics

1616
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,550
and their therapeutic uses.

1617
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,840
And I think great, but
as a good friend of mine

1618
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,595
who's a physician clinician says

1619
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:36,380
better living through chemistry

1620
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,253
still requires better living.

1621
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,300
You cannot expect to take a compound

1622
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,349
regardless of source or potency

1623
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:46,790
and have it completely shift
your experience of life

1624
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:48,710
without having to continue to engage

1625
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,910
in the proper behaviors,
all the things we know

1626
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:53,919
proper sleep, exercise, social
connection, food, et cetera.

1627
01:06:53,919 --> 01:06:56,440
There are many others as well.

1628
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,230
So I still find that this collection

1629
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,710
of studies about omega-3 to omega-6 ratios

1630
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,360
to be profoundly important so
much so that it's completely

1631
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,620
changed the way that I think about food,

1632
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,300
the foods I eat, I do supplement.

1633
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,830
I don't necessarily that
think that's for everybody

1634
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:14,465
but I really think it's incredible

1635
01:07:14,465 --> 01:07:15,730
that there are these compounds

1636
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,160
that have these robust effects

1637
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,990
on our feelings of wellbeing.

1638
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:20,670
And there are others too.

1639
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,400
So that thousand milligram per day

1640
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,620
threshold of fish oil that's beneficial

1641
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,360
requires that one take a reasonable amount

1642
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,650
of these things, either through food

1643
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,003
or through supplementation.

1644
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,623
I acknowledge that not everyone
wants to take fish oil.

1645
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:35,870
There are a couple of reasons

1646
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:37,580
why one might want to avoid that.

1647
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,734
One would be for ethical reasons.

1648
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:43,450
You have an emotional
relationship or a relationship

1649
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,920
to the environment that makes you not want

1650
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,720
to ingest fish related products.

1651
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,910
There's krill oil.

1652
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,000
Krill is still an organism.

1653
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,290
It's a little tiny thing
that whales eat a lot

1654
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,120
of and people generally
eat very little of.

1655
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,860
So krill is out there,
I personally, just me,

1656
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,790
I don't know why, I didn't
react well to krill.

1657
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,090
It didn't make me feel very good.

1658
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,879
I had some like kind of skin
itches and things like that.

1659
01:08:04,879 --> 01:08:06,970
And they stopped when I stopped taking it

1660
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:09,010
but I don't want to bias you against it.

1661
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:09,960
If that's your preference.

1662
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,880
Some people really like krill oil

1663
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,300
as a source of omega-3s.

1664
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,364
I did mention some of the other sources

1665
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:19,029
like chia seeds and flax
seeds, but as you'll notice

1666
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,329
these are not things that
we tend to ingest a lot

1667
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,630
of on a regular basis.

1668
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:25,680
It is possible to get omega-3s from meats.

1669
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,880
If the animals have grazed

1670
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,763
on grasses that contain a lot of omega-3s.

1671
01:08:29,763 --> 01:08:33,167
So for those of you that ingest meat

1672
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:36,330
you're the source of those meat is gonna

1673
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,640
be very important as
it relates to omega-3s.

1674
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,301
Even within the category of fish oil

1675
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:44,180
there's a concern sometimes

1676
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,612
about mercury and other contaminants.

1677
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:49,740
You want to go with a
brand that emphasizes

1678
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,870
that they've gone to really good sources

1679
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:55,687
and that they decontaminate regardless.

1680
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:58,720
And so you have to
search out those brands.

1681
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,020
There is a test that you can do as

1682
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,359
to whether or not the fish
oil is a rancid or not.

1683
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,029
Some people take it in liquid form.

1684
01:09:05,029 --> 01:09:06,409
Some people take in capsule form.

1685
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:08,174
The liquid form is gonna
be more affordable.

1686
01:09:08,174 --> 01:09:09,814
The capsule form is more

1687
01:09:09,814 --> 01:09:13,377
is a little easier and
a little more portable.

1688
01:09:13,377 --> 01:09:18,377
You can actually just chew
one of the gel tablets.

1689
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,840
And if it tastes really
fishy kind of rancid,

1690
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,100
you'll know it's disgusting.

1691
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,439
You want to spit it out.

1692
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,379
And if it doesn't and it's tolerable

1693
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,899
then you'll know that that it's okay.

1694
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:28,979
Unfortunately you have to buy
it first in order to do that.

1695
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:31,349
Although, I don't know, maybe
you can get them to open

1696
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:32,950
up the bottle for you in the store

1697
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,660
and tell them you want to try it.

1698
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,470
Someday perhaps fish oil and omega-3,

1699
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,560
it'll be like tasting wine

1700
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,890
at a restaurant where you
can send it back for now.

1701
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,279
I think you have to purchase it first,

1702
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:46,289
but find a brand you trust in
like, and then work with them.

1703
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,550
If you decide to go that route of course.

1704
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,734
There are other compounds
that are also interesting

1705
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:55,735
for mood elevation that
are essentially like foods

1706
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,520
or are supplement based
that now, fortunately,

1707
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,190
there are really good data
from peer reviewed studies.

1708
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:05,008
And the next one I want to mention

1709
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:08,400
because I think it's really
interesting is L-carnitine.

1710
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,360
Now, L-carnitine has
been around a long time

1711
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,930
and it's been discussed in the context

1712
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:14,610
of heart health and a
number of other things.

1713
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,500
It was actually being touted
as a bit of a weight loss agent

1714
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,613
in the early nineties,
but L-carnitine actually

1715
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:25,267
has some really impressive
effects on depression.

1716
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:29,040
And again, we will look to PubMed

1717
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,010
because looking at examine.com
is essentially for me anyway

1718
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,770
looking at PubMed, what
is L-carnitine okay.

1719
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,334
L-carnitine is most prevalent in meat

1720
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:38,690
and in beef in particular.

1721
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:41,510
Now for the vegans, please
know that L-carnitine

1722
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,160
is available through
non-meat sources as well.

1723
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,980
Although it's not as
enriched in non-meat sources.

1724
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,880
It's a really interesting
molecule because acetylcarnitine

1725
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:53,590
is essentially what's
made from L-carnitine

1726
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,460
but it's acetylated.

1727
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,950
If you're interested in the biochemistry,

1728
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:57,783
you can look that up,

1729
01:10:57,783 --> 01:11:00,470
it's acetylated into a form that can cross

1730
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:01,420
the blood-brain barrier.

1731
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:04,063
The blood-brain barrier
or BBB is a barrier.

1732
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:08,300
It's a wall around the brain
and you have this barrier

1733
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,310
because the brain is so important.

1734
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,320
And it has this feature
that the neurons there

1735
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,045
don't recreate themselves after injury,

1736
01:11:15,045 --> 01:11:17,020
like other organs of the body.

1737
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:19,420
There's not a lot of
turnover of cells despite

1738
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,390
what you might've heard.

1739
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,464
And so nature has created this BBB,

1740
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:26,430
this blood brain barrier to
make sure that certain molecules

1741
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,550
in particular, large
molecules don't get across

1742
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,940
the blood-brain barrier.

1743
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,643
'Cause it can be damaging
to those tissues.

1744
01:11:31,643 --> 01:11:32,750
Incidentally,

1745
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,922
you also have a very
rigid or stringent barrier

1746
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:39,160
around other organs, which are the gonads.

1747
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,130
So the ovaries and the testes

1748
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,140
and the brain are the organs

1749
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,138
of the body that nature has gone out

1750
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:49,190
of its way to protect,
give this additional layer

1751
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:50,940
of the blood-brain barrier

1752
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,370
or as you might imagine for the testes

1753
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,480
and the ovaries, it's going to be

1754
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,560
the blood gonadal barrier.

1755
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,900
So these barriers exist

1756
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,670
to make it such that just
because you eat something,

1757
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:04,320
just because you ingest
it doesn't mean it's going

1758
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,950
to cross the blood-brain barrier,

1759
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,760
but L-carnitine when taken is

1760
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,042
acetylated and converted into this form

1761
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:12,347
that gets across the blood-brain barrier.

1762
01:12:12,347 --> 01:12:14,700
And it has a lot of effects, it's involved

1763
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,340
in mitochondrial activation
of long chain fatty acids

1764
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,489
which that's a big mouthful,

1765
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:20,220
that we'll get into some time when

1766
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,680
we're talking about metabolic,

1767
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,820
but it has some interesting
effects on the neuro side.

1768
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:28,650
So if you decide to check
it out on examine.com

1769
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,810
you'll see some really interesting things,

1770
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:32,507
lots of effects on ammonia,
C-reactive proteins,

1771
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:36,010
things of that sort, blood
glucose is lowered, et cetera.

1772
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:39,192
That's all stuff that's the
level of blood and periphery,

1773
01:12:39,192 --> 01:12:41,548
slight effects in lowering cholesterol.

1774
01:12:41,548 --> 01:12:44,374
Here's some interesting ones.

1775
01:12:44,374 --> 01:12:48,691
Rates of pregnancy go way up when people

1776
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:52,890
are taking L-carnitine both
the father and the mother

1777
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:57,112
but the source of sperm and
the source of egg are affected

1778
01:12:57,112 --> 01:12:59,700
in ways that favors pregnancy.

1779
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,740
It does increase,

1780
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:03,180
here we go again with sperm
quality sperm motility

1781
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:07,600
in males and it seems
to have positive effects

1782
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,120
on females that have
polycystic ovary syndrome.

1783
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,880
So check that out.

1784
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,820
You know, the effects are very strong.

1785
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,360
There are three studies listed there.

1786
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,705
Again, I'm not promoting this,

1787
01:13:17,705 --> 01:13:20,370
but that that people take L-carnitine,

1788
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:22,210
especially if you're
trying to get pregnant

1789
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:24,867
but check it out because the effects there

1790
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,553
and the studies that are
mentioned are published

1791
01:13:27,553 --> 01:13:29,663
in peer reviewed rigorous journals.

1792
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:32,710
In terms of the neural effects.

1793
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,270
Those are quite interesting.

1794
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,210
The effects on depression
are still emerging

1795
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,830
but they do seem to exist

1796
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:42,980
that people feel a notable
decrease in depressive symptoms.

1797
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:45,537
There are seven studies
listed on examine.com

1798
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:47,730
that it has a notable benefit

1799
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:49,691
in a variety of circumstances
where participants

1800
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,780
have heightened depression already.

1801
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,460
They start taking L-carnitine
and they start feeling better.

1802
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,810
And they talk about dosages
in those various studies.

1803
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:01,020
It also has been shown to
have a notable decrease

1804
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:04,090
in the symptoms of autism,
which I find fascinating.

1805
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:06,864
Also again, the things we ingest impact

1806
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,330
the chemicals in our brain

1807
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:11,590
and how they impact the rest of our body.

1808
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,050
There's other things that's
been used to treat certain forms

1809
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,520
of alcohol dependence.

1810
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,708
I think this is going to be a
very exciting emerging area.

1811
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,980
We're gonna do a whole
month about addiction.

1812
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:23,300
I've got a great guest
lined up for that month,

1813
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:28,300
but there's now an emerging
field about what people can take

1814
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,830
and supplement to help ease the cravings

1815
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,980
and the withdrawal when
trying to quit drugs of abuse,

1816
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,850
like cocaine, alcohol, heroin, and smoking

1817
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,130
and things of that sort.

1818
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,740
So really interesting area.

1819
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,770
This is, I like to think is the early days

1820
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:44,930
and we're gonna discover a lot more.

1821
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,369
There's a huge list of things here.

1822
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:49,230
Since we talked about
pain on a previous episode

1823
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:50,063
and I know a lot

1824
01:14:50,063 --> 01:14:53,156
of people have written
to me about fibromyalgia.

1825
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:54,742
It does L carnitine has been shown

1826
01:14:54,742 --> 01:14:57,690
to reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia.

1827
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:00,994
Again, all the links to
studies are on examine.com,

1828
01:15:00,994 --> 01:15:02,760
totally free site.

1829
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,680
And that was my bulldog
being a battering ram.

1830
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,680
There's nothing graceful
about this bulldog.

1831
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,860
He's decided he wanted to leave
to go get a drink of water.

1832
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,009
And so please forgive the noise.

1833
01:15:12,009 --> 01:15:12,842
Okay.

1834
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,250
So now let's turn to another aspect

1835
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:19,421
of the gut-brain relationship
that will surprise you,

1836
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:22,140
in some cases might shock you.

1837
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,790
And that has some really
cool and actionable biology.

1838
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:30,790
And that's the gut microbiome,
probiotics and prebiotics.

1839
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,260
I know today we're talking
about emotions and not pain

1840
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,620
but I'd be remiss if I
didn't mention another effect

1841
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,741
of acetylcarnitine that's been reported

1842
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:40,990
and that you can find listed with link

1843
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,472
to study on examine.com

1844
01:15:42,472 --> 01:15:47,200
which is its effect in reducing
the symptoms of migraine.

1845
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,780
This was a randomized controlled trial

1846
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,947
with 133 participants who
had frequent migraines.

1847
01:15:52,947 --> 01:15:55,250
They were taking 500 milligrams

1848
01:15:55,250 --> 01:16:00,250
of L-carnitine or nothing for 12 weeks.

1849
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:02,250
So the control is a little bit,

1850
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,160
the control experiment
there is a little bit tricky

1851
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,070
but it had a significant effect

1852
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:08,370
on reducing the number of
migraine attacks per month.

1853
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:09,779
So I find that really interesting

1854
01:16:09,779 --> 01:16:12,622
and there's a lot more
listed there about the study.

1855
01:16:12,622 --> 01:16:16,534
And I think these compounds are powerful.

1856
01:16:16,534 --> 01:16:19,730
They carry risks for certain
people, not for others.

1857
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:22,652
So again, you have to find
out what's right for you

1858
01:16:22,652 --> 01:16:25,493
but I do think they are super interesting

1859
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:28,823
as potential therapeutics
for various people.

1860
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,503
So what's the deal

1861
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:34,350
with the gut microbiome
and the gut brain axis.

1862
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,549
Today we've actually been
talking a lot already about

1863
01:16:36,549 --> 01:16:40,295
the gut brain axis that has
nothing to do with microbiomes.

1864
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,845
We've been talking about this vagus nerve

1865
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:46,805
that connects providing
sensory information

1866
01:16:46,805 --> 01:16:48,860
from the body to the brain.

1867
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:53,300
And then the brain also
sends in the same nerve motor

1868
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,530
information to control the
motility that got the heart rate

1869
01:16:56,530 --> 01:17:01,350
how fast we breathe and
deployment of immune stuff

1870
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,675
killer cells and things of that sort.

1871
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:08,540
But oftentimes when we hear
about the gut brain axis

1872
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:13,120
these days, it's a discussion
about the gut microbiome.

1873
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,195
And once again, we're in a situation where

1874
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:16,895
there's incredible biology,

1875
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:19,649
I'm very happy there's so much discussion

1876
01:17:19,649 --> 01:17:21,820
about the gut microbiome.

1877
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:24,840
I am somewhat dismayed
and concerned that most

1878
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,470
of what I hear out there is
either false or partially false.

1879
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,940
So we're gonna clear up some

1880
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:34,175
of the misconceptions, first
by understanding the biology.

1881
01:17:34,175 --> 01:17:35,008
And then we're going to talk

1882
01:17:35,008 --> 01:17:36,560
about some of the actionable items.

1883
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:42,393
It is true that we have
a lot of these little

1884
01:17:42,393 --> 01:17:46,428
microorganisms living in our gut.

1885
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,420
They're not there because
they want to help us.

1886
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:52,480
They don't have brains,
they are adaptive however,

1887
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:56,780
they try and find and create environments

1888
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,190
that make it easier for
them to proliferate.

1889
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:01,380
So they don't care about you and me

1890
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,620
but they are perfectly
willing to exploit you

1891
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,783
and me in order to make more

1892
01:18:05,783 --> 01:18:06,616
of themselves the same way viruses are,

1893
01:18:06,616 --> 01:18:10,610
viruses don't have a
mind, they infect cells,

1894
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,690
they hijack the genome,

1895
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:14,290
and they use that genome
to make more of themselves.

1896
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,650
The microbiota that live in us

1897
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:22,168
vary along the length
of our digestive tract.

1898
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:23,790
But let's just take a step back

1899
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,770
and think about how our body plan is made.

1900
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,700
We are actually a series of tubes.

1901
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,990
Our brain is actually a tube.

1902
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:31,810
You see, it's all squishy on the outside.

1903
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,020
And then it's got that long thing.

1904
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,020
The spinal cord that goes
down to the base of the spine.

1905
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,470
That's the central nervous system

1906
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:37,980
that all started out as a tube.

1907
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:41,010
It just looks like a
cauliflower on the other end

1908
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:45,240
up in the brain because the tube is so big

1909
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,700
and it has to be crammed into the skull.

1910
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,240
So it gets all wrinkled up.

1911
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,760
But if we were to splay it out

1912
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,947
you'd find that it's just one big tube.

1913
01:18:51,947 --> 01:18:54,490
Similarly, our digestive tract

1914
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:57,700
and our airways are
essentially one big tube.

1915
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,270
It starts with our mouth, also our nose.

1916
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,670
And then we have all these other tubes.

1917
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,760
They go down through our throat and then

1918
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,340
into our stomach and then
into our various intestines.

1919
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:10,510
And then the tube ends out the other end.

1920
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:12,800
So we are one long tube for digestion.

1921
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,520
And inside of that tube
is a mucosal lining.

1922
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,370
It's these little microvilli,
tiny, tiny, tiny little

1923
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:24,030
like velvety ends of cells
that are able to move

1924
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:28,327
and move things along and mucus mucosa.

1925
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,950
And the conditions

1926
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,700
of that mucosal lining set a
number of different things.

1927
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,050
It sets the rate

1928
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,940
of our digestion and the
quality of our digestion.

1929
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,400
It sets for instance, our immune system.

1930
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,916
Most people probably don't
realize this, but most infections

1931
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:47,130
in the environment have to
get into our body somehow.

1932
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:49,440
Some of them are inhaled.

1933
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,220
A lot of them go into our mouth

1934
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,780
and lodge in the mucosal
lining of the mouth.

1935
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,010
And then infection start there.

1936
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,060
You probably had the
experience, unfortunately,

1937
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,100
of you know, feeling like you
have a tick in your throat,

1938
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,390
like something's irritating your throat.

1939
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,675
And then it kind of
migrates up into a head cold

1940
01:20:03,675 --> 01:20:06,170
or runny nose.

1941
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,550
Sometimes it'll start as headache.

1942
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:11,060
Sometimes it won't, but
things that are inert

1943
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,720
can migrate down into the gut.

1944
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,760
So we're ingesting things all the time.

1945
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,580
Think about air, bacteria, viruses,

1946
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,500
they're making their way into our gut.

1947
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,970
And some of those
bacteria live in the gut.

1948
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:26,460
And some of those bacteria
bias the mucosal lining

1949
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,840
in the gut, stomach and intestines

1950
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,552
to be more acidic or more basic

1951
01:20:33,552 --> 01:20:36,190
so that they can make more of themselves

1952
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:37,023
so they can replicate.

1953
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:38,440
They like a particular comfort.

1954
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,050
It's like they like a particular kind

1955
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:44,720
of bedding to lie down in and
create more of themselves.

1956
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,210
Now, some of those those mucosal linings

1957
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,240
that they promote make us feel better.

1958
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,440
They make us feel more alert.

1959
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,780
They bolster our immune system

1960
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,560
and others make us feel worse.

1961
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:59,560
So first rule, the
microbiome isn't good or bad.

1962
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,650
Some of these little bugs

1963
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,640
that live in us do bad things to us.

1964
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,170
They make us feel worse.

1965
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,560
They lower our immunity.

1966
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,890
They affect us in negative ways.

1967
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,470
Some of them make us feel
better and they do that mainly

1968
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:16,470
by changing the conditions
of our gut environment.

1969
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,067
In addition to that, they do impact

1970
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:24,067
the neurotransmitters and the
neurons that live in the gut.

1971
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,760
And that signal up to the
brain to impact things

1972
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,990
like dopamine and serotonin

1973
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:31,300
that we've been talking about previously.

1974
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,820
So there's a vast world now

1975
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,560
devoted to try and understand
what sources of food

1976
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,310
what kinds of foods are good or not good

1977
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:42,500
for the gut microbiome?

1978
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,290
So let's just talk about some
general rules of thumb related

1979
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,000
to the research quality
research that's peer reviewed.

1980
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,590
And then in a future episode

1981
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:52,590
we will go far deeper
into the gut microbiome

1982
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,090
and gut brain axis.

1983
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,190
But here's a few things

1984
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:58,814
that I think you might find surprising.

1985
01:21:58,814 --> 01:22:00,230
First of all,

1986
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:04,330
supporting a healthy gut
microbiome is good for mood,

1987
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:08,583
great for digestion and great
for immune system function.

1988
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:13,290
However, that does not mean maxing out

1989
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,640
or taking the most probiotic

1990
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,250
and prebiotic that you
can possibly manage.

1991
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,770
As I mentioned many times before

1992
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,509
I do believe in probiotics,
I take probiotics

1993
01:22:22,509 --> 01:22:24,120
but there are studies that show that

1994
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:27,360
if you take lots and lots
of certain probiotics

1995
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,086
like lactobacillus and you
really ramp up the levels more

1996
01:22:30,086 --> 01:22:32,468
it is not a case of more is better.

1997
01:22:32,468 --> 01:22:37,180
There are things like brain
fog that can come from that,

1998
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,440
brain fog is just this inability to focus.

1999
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,335
People feel really not well generally.

2000
01:22:41,335 --> 01:22:43,590
Some of those studies are
a little bit controversial

2001
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:44,660
but I think it's fair to say

2002
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:48,000
that if people really increase the amount

2003
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,171
of probiotic that they're
taking beyond a certain amount

2004
01:22:52,171 --> 01:22:55,460
then they start feeling foggy in the mind.

2005
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:57,190
Now what's too much?

2006
01:22:57,190 --> 01:22:59,910
Well I get probiotics

2007
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,790
I mentioned before from Athletic Greens,

2008
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:03,430
you can get them from fermented foods

2009
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:07,108
like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi natto,

2010
01:23:07,108 --> 01:23:09,950
these are different sources
from around the world.

2011
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:11,040
Actually, I'd love to hear some

2012
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,140
of the other sources that
people know other foods

2013
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:14,582
from around the world.

2014
01:23:14,582 --> 01:23:16,080
I'm fascinated by the way

2015
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,020
in which different
cultures have all arrived

2016
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,051
at these foods that provide

2017
01:23:22,051 --> 01:23:26,410
and support healthy microbiomes
because they're fermented.

2018
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,780
I have a colleague at
Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg,

2019
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:29,810
and he and I have talked about this.

2020
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:33,930
I don't want to quote him inappropriately,

2021
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,460
but we've had discussions about it,

2022
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,160
and they've published that the ingestion

2023
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,350
of fermented foods is one

2024
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,310
of the best ways to support healthy levels

2025
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:45,500
of gut microbiota without
exceeding the threshold

2026
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,980
that would cause things like brain fog.

2027
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,252
So foods and fermented foods

2028
01:23:50,252 --> 01:23:51,280
are going to be the best source.

2029
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,630
And there are a number

2030
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:54,700
of different ways that one could do that.

2031
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,971
Some people don't like fermented foods,

2032
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:58,751
however some people supplement it.

2033
01:23:58,751 --> 01:24:00,950
So it isn't a case of more is better.

2034
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,270
So we know that.

2035
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,200
The other is that it is true

2036
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,650
that healthy gut microbiota
have been shown to

2037
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:11,190
improve symptoms of certain
psychiatric illnesses

2038
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:15,630
as well as certain conditions
like particular features

2039
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,817
along the autism spectrum,
which is interesting.

2040
01:24:17,817 --> 01:24:21,920
And those effects are probably
due to not just improvement

2041
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,356
of immune system function,

2042
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:27,550
but to the the conditions
in which the neurons

2043
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:30,750
that sense nutrients convey
information to the brain

2044
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:34,340
and increase levels of
serotonin and or dopamine.

2045
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:37,460
So gut microbiome provides
kind of a foundation

2046
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:41,200
for healthy gut and
healthy gut brain access

2047
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,900
so much so that some people report

2048
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,060
that when they start eating small bits

2049
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,680
'cause it doesn't require
a lot of fermented foods,

2050
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,100
that their overall mood is better,

2051
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,600
not unlike the effects of EPA.

2052
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,900
Although I don't think it's been looked

2053
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:55,810
at directly in the context
of clinical depression yet.

2054
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:57,470
And if someone knows of a study

2055
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,750
please mention it in the comments.

2056
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,900
That would be terrific.

2057
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,580
There are some things
that you can do to really

2058
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,580
damage your gut microbiome.

2059
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,495
And this is where there's
a huge misconception

2060
01:25:06,495 --> 01:25:08,530
that I want to clear up.

2061
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:09,529
There was a study that
was published in "Nature",

2062
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:10,362
which is among the three top journals

2063
01:25:10,362 --> 01:25:13,880
that we have in science.

2064
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,470
You know, "Nature", "Science"

2065
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:17,500
and "Cell" are considered the top tops,

2066
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,300
but excellent journal that showed

2067
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,930
that artificial sweeteners

2068
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,750
but a particular artificial sweetener

2069
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:28,275
which was saccharin can
disrupt the gut microbiome

2070
01:25:28,275 --> 01:25:30,100
in ways that is detrimental

2071
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,150
to a number of different health markers,

2072
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,540
increasing inflammatory cytokines

2073
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,826
and all the other bad
things that happen when

2074
01:25:36,826 --> 01:25:41,460
the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter.

2075
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,770
That study was widely discussed

2076
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,451
but there were a few things that were not

2077
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:47,730
mentioned there that are really important.

2078
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:50,903
That study was about
saccharin in particular.

2079
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:56,050
Saccharin is not the
most typical artificial

2080
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,416
sweetener that's used, the most typical

2081
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,971
artificial sweeteners
that are used are things

2082
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:04,370
like aspartame, so-called
NutraSweet or Sucralose,

2083
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,910
or these days Stevia, there's
monk fruits, to my knowledge

2084
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,722
and please correct me if
anyone knows of any studies,

2085
01:26:10,722 --> 01:26:13,450
to my knowledge, the negative effects

2086
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:15,950
of these artificial sweeteners

2087
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:20,130
on the gut microbiome were
restricted to saccharin.

2088
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,610
Now there is enough chemical similarity

2089
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,930
between saccharin and some

2090
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:25,940
of the other ones that I
mentioned, but not all of them.

2091
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:29,700
For instance, Stevia,
monk fruit are distinct

2092
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:34,512
in their chemical makeup so
that they probably don't have

2093
01:26:34,512 --> 01:26:37,850
if they have any, have lower
effects, negative effects

2094
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,600
on the gut microbiome, but
it should still be tested.

2095
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,820
So saccharin is really,
it was shown in this study

2096
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,077
and several other studies
can really negatively

2097
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:50,703
impact the quality of the gut microbiome.

2098
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:54,420
Interestingly, the narrative
around artificial sweeteners

2099
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:58,491
and gut microbiome is incorrect.

2100
01:26:58,491 --> 01:26:59,940
Most people thought,

2101
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:02,930
oh, saccharin is bad for the microbiome.

2102
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,880
It must kill the microbiome.

2103
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,150
And so you hear people saying,

2104
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:08,340
oh, artificial sweeteners
kill the microbiome.

2105
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:09,180
That's not true at all.

2106
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,780
In fact, in that very same
study published in nature

2107
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,640
they showed that the negative affects

2108
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,273
of saccharin on the
microbiome could be blocked

2109
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:19,670
or eliminated by giving antibiotics.

2110
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:22,290
So what happens is certain
artificial sweeteners

2111
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:25,646
in particular saccharin
disrupt the microbiome

2112
01:27:25,646 --> 01:27:28,200
and make the environment

2113
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,250
within the gut that mucosal
lining more favorable

2114
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:37,250
to bacteria microbiota that
are not good for the organism.

2115
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:40,310
This is an important distinction.

2116
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:42,830
It's not just a language
thing where people say,

2117
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,900
oh, you know, it kills the microbiome.

2118
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:45,990
It doesn't kill the microbiome.

2119
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:49,190
It shifts the microbiome and shifts

2120
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,370
in the microbiome can be
good or they can be bad.

2121
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,998
And that takes us to another topic

2122
01:27:52,998 --> 01:27:54,910
that's a bit of a hot button topic

2123
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:55,830
but I'm willing to go there.

2124
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:57,863
'Cause I think it deserves conversation,

2125
01:27:58,977 --> 01:28:01,660
which is nowadays there
are many examples out there

2126
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:04,670
where people have switched
from a kind of standard diet

2127
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:09,670
or even a vegetarian diet to
a vegan diet, to a keto diet.

2128
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,420
Now keto doesn't necessarily have to mean

2129
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,891
the ingestion of meats, but it can.

2130
01:28:13,891 --> 01:28:17,080
And they experience positive
effects for themselves.

2131
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:17,913
Not everybody.

2132
01:28:17,913 --> 01:28:20,050
And I've talked previously
about some of the

2133
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,530
kind of the incorrect,

2134
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:25,790
what I believe is
incorrect marketing of keto

2135
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:28,070
as it relates to the cosmetic effects

2136
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:30,080
and some of the challenges with
sleep that some people have

2137
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,400
but some people love keto
and it works great for them.

2138
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,380
But the ketogenic diet is interesting

2139
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:37,920
because when one shifts
to the ketogenic diet

2140
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,760
there is a shift in the gut microbiome.

2141
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,610
And some people end up feeling better.

2142
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:44,890
Some people end up feeling worse.

2143
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:49,310
Likewise, some people go from
ingesting animal products

2144
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:52,910
including meat or they're
vegetarian and they go to vegan

2145
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:57,910
and they experience positive
shifts in mood and affect.

2146
01:28:58,049 --> 01:29:00,260
And we know that the transition to a more

2147
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:04,450
plant-based diet and especially
the enrichment of fiber

2148
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:08,710
that's present in those diets
also creates dramatic shifts

2149
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,970
in the gut microbiome.

2150
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,730
Some people feel better doing that.

2151
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:12,780
Some people feel worse.

2152
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,400
And of course, it's
gonna depend on whether

2153
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,350
or not you're ingesting a lot
of processed foods or not.

2154
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:18,045
There was a paper published in "Cell",

2155
01:29:18,045 --> 01:29:21,170
"Cell Press" journal
obviously, excellent journal,

2156
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:23,235
showing that ingestion of processed foods,

2157
01:29:23,235 --> 01:29:25,120
regardless of whether or not they come

2158
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,662
from animal sources or non-animal sources

2159
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:31,470
the processed foods themselves
tend to create activity

2160
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:34,300
within the body and this surely has roots

2161
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,390
in the nervous system that lead

2162
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:38,568
to over-consumption of
calories and weight gain.

2163
01:29:38,568 --> 01:29:40,980
Even some weight gain
that couldn't be explained

2164
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,850
by increased calories.

2165
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:44,020
In other words, processed
foods are bad, regardless of

2166
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,890
whether or not you're
talking about animal products

2167
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:48,750
or non animal products,
probably not surprising

2168
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,740
given what you know
about these sugar sensing

2169
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,830
and other amino acid sensing cells

2170
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,860
in the gut that we talked about earlier.

2171
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:58,070
So the point of all this is
that when I say you have to

2172
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:00,708
find what's right for you,
that's not a throwaway statement.

2173
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:04,344
Some people's microbiome and the lining

2174
01:30:04,344 --> 01:30:09,323
of their mucosa, excuse me,

2175
01:30:09,323 --> 01:30:10,840
their mucosa lining of their throat,

2176
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,050
of their gut, of their nose,

2177
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:16,430
everything is improved by diets
that are heavily meat based

2178
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,510
and don't have many plants.

2179
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:19,893
Other people do much better
on a plant-based diet

2180
01:30:19,893 --> 01:30:22,530
without many meat products
or animal products.

2181
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:23,960
It's highly individual.

2182
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,319
And this probably has
roots in genetic makeup.

2183
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:30,050
This probably has roots
in what people were raised

2184
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,950
on because remember the
nervous system of course

2185
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:35,640
is set up by your genetic, your
genes, your genetic program

2186
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,010
but your nervous system adapts early

2187
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:40,320
in life to your conditions.

2188
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,180
That's what it's for,

2189
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,815
the reason you have a
nervous system is to move

2190
01:30:43,815 --> 01:30:45,650
your body appropriately
towards things that are good

2191
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,130
for you and away from things that are not.

2192
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:50,200
But also it was designed to adapt.

2193
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,320
The early life period
has this incredible thing

2194
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,130
about plasticity that
we spent a whole month

2195
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:56,230
on so that it can change so that yes

2196
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:58,010
indeed some people may like certain foods

2197
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,651
and react to certain
foods better than others

2198
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:03,320
because of the way that their
nervous system was wired.

2199
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,139
This enteric as it's called nervous system

2200
01:31:05,139 --> 01:31:08,360
that lines the gut and the
communicates with the brain.

2201
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,500
So most of what I've talked

2202
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,590
about today is kind of black and white.

2203
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:14,210
These are things that
are present in all of us,

2204
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:15,600
the sugar sensing neurons of the gut,

2205
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,300
the way the vagus is wired.

2206
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,090
The fact that omega-3
omega-6 is tend to improve.

2207
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,950
The ratios tend to impact
mood with high omega-3.

2208
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:25,270
omega-6 ratios improving mood.

2209
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:28,500
We talked about all sorts
of things in the gut brain

2210
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,914
and body brain axis, but when
it comes to the microbiome

2211
01:31:31,914 --> 01:31:34,790
the key thing is that we
all have a microbiome.

2212
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:36,992
You want a microbiome, but you want to

2213
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:40,310
promote the microbiome
that is right for you.

2214
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:42,771
And that can be shifted and steered

2215
01:31:42,771 --> 01:31:46,899
by ingesting certain categories
of foods and not others.

2216
01:31:46,899 --> 01:31:49,676
And one thing that really
frustrates me is when

2217
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:51,553
the people show up with an agenda,

2218
01:31:52,505 --> 01:31:54,570
like all meat agenda or a vegan agenda

2219
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:57,360
or a keto agenda, and they talk
about these positive effects

2220
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,600
on the gut microbiome.

2221
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,280
And it's all true, frankly.

2222
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,480
And so it's highly individual.

2223
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,630
Now this doesn't get to
any of the ethical issues

2224
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:05,080
around animals or the planet,

2225
01:32:06,122 --> 01:32:10,274
and you hear rabid debates
about that on both sides.

2226
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:13,740
And I am not qualified or equipped to talk

2227
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:15,753
about whether or not
regenerative agriculture,

2228
01:32:15,753 --> 01:32:18,430
animal products, or farming
or any of these things,

2229
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,570
how those actually impact the environment,

2230
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,730
that is not my expertise,

2231
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:24,248
but when it comes to your
health and your microbiome

2232
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:26,060
you want to support the microbiome.

2233
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,400
It's very clear

2234
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,070
that these fermented foods
support the microbiome

2235
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:33,690
that we should be ingesting
at least two servings per day.

2236
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:36,611
Which is quite a lot that supplementation

2237
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:38,485
at low levels can be good.

2238
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:41,330
Supplementation at high levels
can create this brain fog

2239
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:43,328
even though some people say
that result is controversial.

2240
01:32:43,328 --> 01:32:46,830
I've experienced this
myself and the data looked

2241
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:49,130
to me pretty darn solid.

2242
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:52,021
So that's one thing to
think about as well.

2243
01:32:52,021 --> 01:32:55,530
And the other thing
about the gut microbiome

2244
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,470
is that it's highly contextual based

2245
01:32:57,470 --> 01:32:58,740
on other things that you're doing.

2246
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,490
So even things like exercise
and social well-being

2247
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,520
and connection, those
things are also impacting

2248
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,124
the gut microbiome.

2249
01:33:05,124 --> 01:33:06,310
So find the diet that's right for you.

2250
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:09,936
And that works for you in the
context of the other ethical

2251
01:33:09,936 --> 01:33:12,420
and lifestyle choices
that are important to you.

2252
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,490
That's my advice.

2253
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:15,030
A note about fasting.

2254
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:16,940
I have a colleague at
Yale, who's an expert

2255
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,926
in the gut microbiome.

2256
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,600
And he told me something
really interesting,

2257
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,033
which is when we fast,

2258
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:27,920
we actually digest certain components

2259
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,030
within our dietary tract.

2260
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:33,380
It actually depletes a good
amount of the gut microbiome.

2261
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:35,181
And this is interesting.

2262
01:33:35,181 --> 01:33:36,014
I've had good results

2263
01:33:36,014 --> 01:33:38,410
from I guess you would call
it intermittent or kind

2264
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:41,440
of circadian type fasting where
I've never done long fast,

2265
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,890
but where I push out my
first meal by a few hours

2266
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:46,209
my first meal is generally
around lunchtime or so

2267
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:50,130
but the longer periods of
fasting that go for a day

2268
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:52,477
or two or three days are known to deplete

2269
01:33:52,477 --> 01:33:56,220
the gut microbiome in major ways.

2270
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,170
But that's not always
necessarily a bad thing

2271
01:33:58,170 --> 01:34:02,096
because when it's replenished,
it often is replenished

2272
01:34:02,096 --> 01:34:05,640
at levels that exceeded
its previous level.

2273
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,790
But I think that some of
the GI tract and even some

2274
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:12,630
of the mental effects of
returning to eating after feeding

2275
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:14,670
sometimes people don't feel so
good when they start eating.

2276
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:17,288
They really want food, but
then they start eating again.

2277
01:34:17,288 --> 01:34:18,270
They don't feel as good
as they did on the fast.

2278
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,494
Some of that may be
related to the depletion

2279
01:34:20,494 --> 01:34:23,140
of the microbiome that
occurs during long fast.

2280
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:25,279
So again, this is something
to think about and talk about

2281
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:28,283
with your doctor, but
the idea that fasting

2282
01:34:28,283 --> 01:34:30,357
across the board is good.

2283
01:34:30,357 --> 01:34:32,970
There may be some merits
to that, and certainly

2284
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:36,680
in some cases, but it does
deplete the microbiome

2285
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,010
and that depletion of the
microbiome is significant

2286
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:41,720
because it means when you return
to eating, you're actually

2287
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,549
not in the same position to digest

2288
01:34:43,549 --> 01:34:45,240
and assimilate those foods.

2289
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,250
And those foods are not
in the same position to

2290
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,790
impact your brain and body the same way

2291
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,930
they were prior to the fast.

2292
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:52,790
And this is, I think why
people suggest a kind

2293
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:54,820
of gradual transition back

2294
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:58,320
to consuming nutrients after a fast.

2295
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,974
So as we round up, I want to
share some results with you

2296
01:35:00,974 --> 01:35:05,545
That without question will
impact the way that you respond

2297
01:35:05,545 --> 01:35:08,810
to food mentally and even physically.

2298
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:11,550
And I know that because
that's the central theme

2299
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:13,890
of the studies I'm
about to tell you about.

2300
01:35:13,890 --> 01:35:16,700
I have a colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum,

2301
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:20,913
who's done some remarkable
experiments on mindset.

2302
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:24,660
And some people could think
about these as placebo effects

2303
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,823
or belief effects,

2304
01:35:27,076 --> 01:35:29,490
but they actually go
way beyond those terms.

2305
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:31,990
And there are a number
of different examples

2306
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:33,410
of this that Aaliyah's lab

2307
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:35,470
and her coworkers have demonstrated.

2308
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:38,957
But two that are particularly
interesting to me

2309
01:35:38,957 --> 01:35:40,750
I Want to share with you now

2310
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,900
because they really emphasize how

2311
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:45,807
our beliefs can really
impact the way that our brain

2312
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:47,600
and body work together.

2313
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,120
I think the most famous of
these is an experiment they did

2314
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,150
where they had two groups of individuals.

2315
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:57,150
They were each given a milkshake
and they had some factors

2316
01:35:58,178 --> 01:36:01,370
measured from their
blood by an IV while they

2317
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,300
ingested the milkshake.

2318
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,370
And then afterwards as well.

2319
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:06,220
And one of the factors
that they were looking

2320
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:10,780
at was something called
grehlin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

2321
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,850
Grehlin is a peptide that
increases with hunger.

2322
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:16,320
So the longer you haven't
eaten that grehlin goes up.

2323
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,780
And I know some of you say,
well, I fast, I fast, I fast

2324
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,020
and I eventually lose my appetite.

2325
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,180
Well, grehlin still goes
up and then it drops.

2326
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:25,180
So if you were one of these
people that eats every three

2327
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:28,050
hours regularly, grehlin
kind of gets a little pulse

2328
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:30,580
as you get to that two
hour and 50 minute mark.

2329
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,390
So it's a little bit of a timer as well.

2330
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:34,451
It's really interesting peptide.

2331
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:39,080
In any event, what they did is
they gave people milkshakes,

2332
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,650
two groups, one group got
a shake that they were told

2333
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:44,720
it was a low calorie, healthy shake.

2334
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,310
The other got a milkshake
that they were told

2335
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:52,210
it was the very decadent
high calorie shake.

2336
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:54,560
I think it was something
like two or maybe even two

2337
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,410
and a half times as many
calories as the other.

2338
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:59,730
Perhaps even more, I
don't recall the details,

2339
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:00,650
but you got a high calorie

2340
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,260
and a low calorie condition.

2341
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,610
And then they drank the shake

2342
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:08,460
and then they measured grehlin
in these subjects' blood.

2343
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,110
And what they found was
that the high calorie shake

2344
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:13,831
had a much more robust effect

2345
01:37:13,831 --> 01:37:18,412
on blunting grehlin and reducing grehlin.

2346
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:21,150
But the interesting thing you
probably guessed already is

2347
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:24,630
that it was the exact same
shake given to both groups.

2348
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:27,330
So people's belief about the content

2349
01:37:27,330 --> 01:37:30,430
of something impacted their physiology.

2350
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:33,060
And this speaks to the so-called top

2351
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:36,830
down mechanisms or
modulation of our physiology.

2352
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,770
In a previous episode about pain

2353
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:41,692
we talked about the effects of obsessive

2354
01:37:41,692 --> 01:37:44,394
believe it or not, it was
an obsessive infatuation

2355
01:37:44,394 --> 01:37:47,690
and love on pain responses
and pain thresholds.

2356
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,673
This is yet another example where beliefs

2357
01:37:49,673 --> 01:37:52,970
or subjective feelings
can impact physiology

2358
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:54,120
at the level of the periphery,

2359
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:57,700
because grehlin is released
in the periphery in the body.

2360
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,080
Now, these beliefs affects

2361
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,720
extend beyond examples like this,

2362
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,470
another good example
that I'd like to share

2363
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:07,240
is Alia, Dr. Crum,

2364
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,940
and her colleagues did an experiment where

2365
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:11,901
they took housekeepers,

2366
01:38:11,901 --> 01:38:13,685
they were essentially hotel workers,

2367
01:38:13,685 --> 01:38:15,440
divide them into two groups.

2368
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,180
They had them watch a short film.

2369
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,779
In one case, the film was about how

2370
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:21,810
their work was important to
help people feel comfortable

2371
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,780
in the hotel, et cetera, et cetera.

2372
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:26,130
The other group heard that
the activity that they were

2373
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:27,610
doing cleaning and taking care

2374
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,240
of the hotel was good for them.

2375
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,790
It was good for their
health, et cetera, et cetera.

2376
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:34,970
They controlled very nicely in the study

2377
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:39,000
for health parameters, for
individual differences.

2378
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,430
And for the behaviors of
these people in the period

2379
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,860
that followed this short tutorial.

2380
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:47,085
And what they found was eight weeks later,

2381
01:38:47,085 --> 01:38:51,130
the group that had been told
that the activity was good

2382
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,530
for them showed lower blood pressure.

2383
01:38:53,530 --> 01:38:56,100
They had lost a significant
amount of body fat

2384
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,330
and they reported enjoying
their work far more

2385
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:00,163
than the other group.

2386
01:39:00,163 --> 01:39:03,428
The same work, simply biased mentally

2387
01:39:03,428 --> 01:39:06,560
by the information that they were given,

2388
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:10,630
but their physiology
followed that information.

2389
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:14,190
And so this is not just
the placebo effect.

2390
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:15,669
This is an incredible set

2391
01:39:15,669 --> 01:39:18,410
of findings that illustrate
the extent to which whether

2392
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:20,490
or not we believe a food is gonna be good

2393
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:22,147
for us or not good for us.

2394
01:39:22,147 --> 01:39:24,660
Well, we can't escape the reality.

2395
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,790
You can't tell yourself that
a poison is gonna be good

2396
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:27,960
for you and ingest that poison

2397
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,010
and expect it to not kill you,

2398
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:34,890
nor can you tell yourself
that eating 12 croissants,

2399
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:36,290
I confess I've done it,

2400
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:39,140
it was after a very long
run, a long time ago

2401
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,120
but you can't tell yourself

2402
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,500
that that's necessarily going to be good

2403
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,990
for you or that it's gonna
make you lose weight.

2404
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:47,330
These belief effects are not about lying

2405
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:49,810
to yourself in these
cases, in these experiments

2406
01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:53,780
as you'll notice that subjects
didn't have prior knowledge

2407
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:55,550
about grehlin or about the effects

2408
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:58,980
of their daily routine on
weight loss and blood pressure.

2409
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:00,120
So in order for them to work

2410
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,740
you have to be naive to
the information, right?

2411
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,340
You can't simply lie to yourself

2412
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,381
and tell yourself what you want to believe

2413
01:40:07,381 --> 01:40:12,350
and that's important, but also
important is that the mind

2414
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:14,850
and the body are in this
fascinating interplay.

2415
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:17,246
And today we've talked
mainly about how the body

2416
01:40:17,246 --> 01:40:20,620
and things that we put inside this tube,

2417
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:24,890
that runs from our mouth to
the other end to our rectum,

2418
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:28,080
basically is impacting all these cells,

2419
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,702
these neurons, microbiota
in their mucosal lining,

2420
01:40:32,702 --> 01:40:35,610
heart, lungs and how all
that information is feeding

2421
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:38,120
up to the brain to impact
how we feel up here.

2422
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:40,464
But also how we feel up here is impacting

2423
01:40:40,464 --> 01:40:43,100
how our body reacts at levels

2424
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:46,382
of very core physiology that
you couldn't just tell yourself

2425
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:49,016
that this was gonna work,
but what you believe

2426
01:40:49,016 --> 01:40:51,800
about certain substances, certain foods,

2427
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,530
certain nutrients does
have a profound effect

2428
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:57,270
on the magnitude of their impact

2429
01:40:57,270 --> 01:41:01,360
and sometimes even the quality
and direction of that impact.

2430
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,870
Well, first of all,

2431
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:05,270
I want to thank everybody for
their support of this podcast.

2432
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:07,780
The response that we've
received since releasing

2433
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:10,300
at the beginning of the new
year has been tremendous.

2434
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,856
And we're so grateful for it.

2435
01:41:11,856 --> 01:41:14,163
I know some of you and people I've said,

2436
01:41:14,163 --> 01:41:16,460
well, it's a lot of information.

2437
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,310
It's like a college lecture.

2438
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:20,010
Indeed, there's a lot of information,

2439
01:41:20,010 --> 01:41:23,473
but I believe very strongly
that if you learn mechanism

2440
01:41:23,473 --> 01:41:26,268
and maybe even if you
hear it several times over

2441
01:41:26,268 --> 01:41:28,660
eventually those
mechanisms become embedded

2442
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:31,051
into the way that you
view an entire topic.

2443
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:33,840
As well, I always try and put tools

2444
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,051
as I go along that you
can look to immediately.

2445
01:41:36,051 --> 01:41:37,920
Some of them might be right for you.

2446
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,190
Others might not,

2447
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:41,930
try them if you like and
don't if you don't want to,

2448
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:44,383
and if they don't work for
you, then discard them.

2449
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:46,630
If however, you are finding benefits

2450
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:49,300
from the information and
from the tools and you know

2451
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,520
others that you think
could benefit from it,

2452
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:55,070

2463
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:14,270
we've set up a Patreon account.

2464
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:17,570
It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.

2465
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:20,402
It allows you to support the
podcast at a variety of levels.

2466
01:42:20,402 --> 01:42:24,500
We have the 5-HTP
serotonin for $5 a month,

2467
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,670
the Costello, $10 a month

2468
01:42:26,670 --> 01:42:28,035
in honor of Costello, et cetera.

2469
01:42:28,035 --> 01:42:30,270
You don't have to but if you'd like to,

2470
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:31,660
that would be terrific.

2471
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,310
In addition, please check out our sponsors

2472
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:35,640
that we've mentioned at the
beginning of the podcast.

2473
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,920
That's one of the best
ways to help support us.

2474
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,520
And we do believe in all
the products that we support

2475
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,530
and our sponsors very much otherwise

2476
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:45,780
we wouldn't be working with them.

2477
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:48,930
So much so that when I
mentioned supplements

2478
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:50,870
and I talk about supplements
throughout the course

2479
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:53,850
of the episodes, I don't
mention specific brands,

2480
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:56,750
but I would be remiss if
I didn't mention the fact

2481
01:42:56,750 --> 01:43:01,118
that we have partnered
with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

2482
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:03,260
And we've done that because we know

2483
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,770
that Thorne uses the highest levels

2484
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:09,400
of stringency in terms of
the products they produce.

2485
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,320
What they say is in each capsule

2486
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:13,010
and tablet actually is,

2487
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:14,370
they're used by the Mayo Clinic,

2488
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:15,740
by all the major sports teams

2489
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,520
because of their level
of stringency and rigor.

2490
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,630
If you want to know
what supplements I take

2491
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:25,630
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

2492
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:27,280
And you can see the
supplements that I take

2493
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,810
and you can get those as well

2494
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,550
as any of the other supplements

2495
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:33,180
and products that Thorne
makes for 20% off.

2496
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:38,180
So it's thorne.com/u/huberman to get 20%

2497
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:41,920
off any supplements that Thorne makes.

2498
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,350
So in today's episode,
we took a full journey

2499
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:45,980
into the brain body relationship

2500
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,840
and discussed a lot of the mechanisms

2501
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,790
and the actionable items
that you can approach

2502
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,500
if you want to explore this aspect

2503
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,780
of your biology and psychology further.

2504
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:56,950
Last, but certainly not least,

2505
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,200
I want to thank everybody

2506
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,610
for your time and attention today,

2507
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:03,051
and as always, thank you for
your interest in science.

2508
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:05,634
