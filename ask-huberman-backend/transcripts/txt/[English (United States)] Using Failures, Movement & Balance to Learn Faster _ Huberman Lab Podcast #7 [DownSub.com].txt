00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,080
- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,940
where we discuss science
and science-based tools

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,983
for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,830
My name is Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,580
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,440
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,540
This podcast is separate

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,900
from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,850
It is, however, part
of my desire and effort

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,980
to bring you zero cost
to consumer information

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,910
about science and science-related tools.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,960
In keeping with that theme,

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,790
I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,479
Our first sponsor is Headspace.

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,910
Headspace is a meditation app
that makes meditation easy.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,070
I've been meditating on and
off now for about 30 years,

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,610
although I confess more off than on.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,250
And that's because I think
like, for a lot of people,

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,640
sticking to a meditation practice
can be pretty challenging.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,940
I started using Headspace a few years ago

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,050
and I found that it's really allowed me to

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,500
stick to a meditation
practice on a regular basis.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,680
I meditate anywhere from
five to seven times a week.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,850
The app includes meditations

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,010
that are all backed by
scientific peer-reviewed studies.

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,010
And it makes it really easy to start

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,700
and complete the meditations.

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,140
I started using these
meditations while I was flying

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,410
a few years back.

30
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,320
On JetBlue flights,

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,080
they started offering
Headspace meditations.

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,330
That's where I initially started.

33
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,030
And then I moved over to the app,

34
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,280
and I really enjoy it and I
derive great benefit from it.

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,780
If you'd like to try Headspace,

36
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,200
you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,033
And if you do that,

38
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,450
you'll get all the meditations
that Headspace offers

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,020
for free for one month.

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,190
That's headspace.com/specialoffer.

41
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,540
You get all the meditations for free,

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,193
which is the best offer that

43
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:37,260
they has available right now.

44
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,410
So if you're interested
in it, check it out.

45
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,660
The second sponsor of today's
podcast is Athletic Greens.

46
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,470
Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral

47
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,100
probiotic drink.

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,140
I started using Athletic Greens in 2012,

49
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,840
and I've been using it
continuously ever since.

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,083
I started using Athletic Greens because

51
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,540
I found it rather dizzying to know

52
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,690
which vitamins and minerals to take.

53
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,750
And Athletic Greens allows me to get

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,270
the full base of all the
necessary vitamins and minerals

55
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,670
in one easy to consume drink.

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,020
It also turns out that the
drink tastes quite good.

57
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,280
I mix mine with some lemon
juice and some water,

58
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,410
I drink it once or twice a day.

59
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,160
The probiotics in Athletic
Greens are also important to me

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,780
because there are a lot
of data now supporting

61
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,440
the fact that the gut microbiome

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,590
is important for the gut-brain axis

63
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,610
for various aspects of cognitive function,

64
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,060
immune function, metabolic function.

65
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,430
There's just a huge number of things

66
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,160
that having a healthy gut microbiome

67
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,620
has been shown to be important for.

68
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,340
So by taking Athletic Greens,

69
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,990
I have that base covered as well.

70
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,390
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

71
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,740
you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

72
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,920
And if you do that,

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,910
they'll give you a year supply
of liquid vitamin D3 K2.

74
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,750
There are also a lot of data
now showing that vitamin D3

75
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,430
is very important for
a number of different

76
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,290
biological functions.

77
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,510
In addition, they'll give
you five free travel packs

78
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,710
with your order.

79
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,720
It can be difficult to mix
up powders while on the road,

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,230
when in a car, or in a hotel,
or on a plane, et cetera.

81
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,670
The travel packs make everything
really clean and easy.

82
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,480
So you'll get the year
supply of vitamin D3 K2

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,960
plus the five free travel packs

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,730
if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

85
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,770
The third sponsor of
today's podcast is Madefor.

86
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,200
Madefor is behavioral science company

87
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,790
that makes learning positive
habits and growth mindset easy.

88
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,410
I've been involved with
Madefor since the beginning

89
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,130
as the lead of their scientific advisory.

90
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,020
Other members of the
scientific advisory include,

91
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,130
for instance, the head
of the chronobiology unit

92
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,200
at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,660
as well as psychiatrists
from Harvard Medical School

94
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,120
and elsewhere, all of whom
are serious about science

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,260
and science-related tools

96
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,550
for developing positive
habits and growth mindset.

97
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,610
The program is a 10 month-program,

98
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,010
during which each month you
engage in a specific activity

99
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,890
designed to encourage and cultivate

100
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,260
positive habits and growth mindset.

101
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,230
As well, we hold a monthly Zoom call,

102
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,960
during which we discuss the
program, people's progress,

103
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,190
and answer any questions
they have directly.

104
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,490
If you'd like to try Madefor,
you can go to getmadefor.com,

105
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,330
and if you put Huberman in at checkout,

106
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,010
you'll get 20% off the program.

107
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,610
That's getmadefor.com,

108
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,720
put Huberman in at checkout,
and get 20% off the program.

109
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
Today, we're going to talk about

110
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,040
how to change your nervous
system for the better.

111
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,649
As you recall, your nervous
system includes your brain

112
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,310
and your spinal cord,

113
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,280
but also all the connections
that your brain and spinal cord

114
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,540
make with the organs of your body

115
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,360
and all the connections
that the organs of your body

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,570
make with your brain and spinal cord.

117
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,020
This thing that we call the
nervous system is responsible

118
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,860
for everything we know,

119
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,430
all our behavior, all our emotions,

120
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,130
everything we feel about
ourselves and the outside world,

121
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,360
everything we think and believe.

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,510
It's really at the center of
our entire experience of life

123
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,473
and who we are.

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,460
Fortunately, in humans,
unlike in other species,

125
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,560
we can change our nervous system

126
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,030
by taking some very specific
and deliberate actions.

127
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,170
And, today, we're really
going to focus on the actions,

128
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,170
the motor commands and the
aspects of movement and balance

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,880
that allow us to change
our nervous system.

130
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,310
It turns out that movement and balance

131
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,870
actually provide windows or portals

132
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,750
into our ability to
change our nervous system

133
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,640
the way we want,

134
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,580
even if those changes are not about

135
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,270
learning new movements or
learning how to balance.

136
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,350
And soon you'll understand why.

137
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,500
So, today, we're going to talk a lot about

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,560
the basic science of neuroplasticity.

139
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,140
I promise to not use
excessive nomenclature.

140
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,290
There'll be a little bit,

141
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,860
but I'll try and make
it as clear as possible.

142
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,580
And we're also going to talk a
lot about protocols and tools

143
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,430
that the scientific literature points to

144
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,450
and support for changing
our nervous system,

145
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,250
again, not just for sake of
learning new motor movements

146
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,890
or how to balance better,

147
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,050
but for how to feel differently

148
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,840
about particular experiences,

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,790
both past, present, and future,

150
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,710
and as well as how to learn faster.

151
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,680
We're not going to discuss
hacks, a word I loath,

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,640
we're not going to discuss gimmicks,

153
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,200
we're going to discuss
mechanism and scientific data

154
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,960
and the tools that those mechanisms

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,030
and scientific data point to

156
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,330
so that you can tailor your
practices around learning

157
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,330
to your specific needs and goals.

158
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,770
So let's begin by just examining

159
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,500
the big picture question which is,

160
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,140
does the brain control behavior?

161
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,630
And my hope is that everyone
is immediately thinking yes.

162
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,280
The brain and nervous
system, we really should say,

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,580
'cause the brain is just one component

164
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,610
of the nervous system,

165
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,840
controls our behavior.

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,340
How does it do that?

167
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,440
Well, there are a couple different
levels that it does that.

168
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,170
First of all, if we're
talking about movement,

169
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,720
behavior generally means movement,

170
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,120
if we're talking about movement,

171
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,050
we have two categories of neurons

172
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,610
that are very important to think about

173
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,240
in the context of neuroplasticity.

174
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,030
First of all, we have what are
called lower motor neurons.

175
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,943
These are motor neurons that
live in our spinal cord.

176
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
For the aficionados out there,

177
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,540
for those of you that might
be headed to medical school

178
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,990
or just want to learn
more about the anatomy,

179
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,910
they live in the ventral
horn of the spinal cord.

180
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,580
But that doesn't matter if
you don't want to know that,

181
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,960
just know that you have
these things called

182
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,740
lower motor neurons.

183
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,210
These are neurons that
are in the spinal cord

184
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,610
but they extend a wire
that we call an axon

185
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,230
out into the peripheral
nervous system, into the body.

186
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,940
And those neurons connect with muscle.

187
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,120
They send electrical potentials out there

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,890
that allow our muscles
to twitch into contract.

189
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,530
As a little point of fact, actually,

190
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,070
we don't have muscle memory.

191
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,960
There's no such thing as muscle memory.

192
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,330
Muscles are dumb.

193
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,930
They don't know anything,

194
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,360
they don't have a history,
they don't have a memory,

195
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,330
they don't know anything.

196
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,490
It is the neurons that
control those muscles

197
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,550
and their firing patterns
in which all the information

198
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,870
for motor patterns are stored.

199
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,440
So your ability to walk
is not muscle memory,

200
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,173
it's neural memory.

201
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,530
Now, the lower motor neurons,

202
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,210
while smarter than the muscle so to speak,

203
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,220
are not the most brilliant
of the motor neurons.

204
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,400
They are generally involved
in doing what they are told,

205
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,190
and they are told what
to do from two sources.

206
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,620
We have circuits in our brainstem,

207
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,590
so this would be kind of around
your neck deep in the brain,

208
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,210
that are called central
pattern generators.

209
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,980
These are sometimes called CPGs.

210
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,549
Central pattern generators
are what allow us to generate

211
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,809
repetitive patterns of movement.

212
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,399
So inhaling and exhaling,
inhaling and exhaling

213
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,200
subconsciously is controlled
by a central pattern generator.

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
That just means a collection of neurons.

215
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,872
If you really want to know,

216
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,260
they're called the pre-Botzinger neurons

217
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,900
discovered by Jack Feldman
and colleagues at UCLA.

218
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,940
These neurons in the brainstem

219
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,650
send information down the phrenic nerve

220
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,840
and control the diaphragm.

221
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,750
And it goes inhale,
exhale, inhale, exhale.

222
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,880
And you don't have to think about that.

223
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,820
You could think about it

224
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,180
and you could change the
durations of inhales and exhales

225
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,410
and change that up,

226
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,100
but the motor neurons that control that

227
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,373
are just responding to what
the brain is telling it to do.

228
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,780
The other central pattern
generators include

229
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,900
things like walking.

230
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,120
The right limb-left limb, right
limb-left limb pattern that

231
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,860
we normally associate with walking

232
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,330
was learned during childhood,

233
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,670
and these central pattern
generators, sometimes called CPGs,

234
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,010
tell our lower motor neurons, "Fire.

235
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,440
Now you fire, now you fire."

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,630
So they are literally saying,
"Right, left, right left."

237
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,040
They are the marching
orders from the brainstem

238
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
to the lower motor neurons.

239
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,360
So these lower motor neurons
do what they are told.

240
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,150
They are obedient little soldiers

241
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,000
and they do what they are told,

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,420
and their job is to make
the muscles contract

243
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,470
at specific times.

244
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,310
Okay.

245
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,200
That's all simple.

246
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
But then there are the
upper motor neurons.

247
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,860
The upper motor neurons actually
reside in our motor cortex,

248
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,040
way up on top of the brain.

249
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,410
And they are involved in sending signals

250
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,890
for deliberate action.

251
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,380
So they send signals to
the lower motor neurons

252
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,300
which are the effectors,

253
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,890
the ones that actually
control the muscles,

254
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,000
but the upper motor neurons are the ones

255
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,060
that send very specific signals.

256
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,210
For instance, the signals
that would allow you

257
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,970
to make a cup of coffee in the morning

258
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,050
or to deliberately engage
in any kind of behavior.

259
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,240
Now, you can probably make a
cup of coffee in the morning

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
without having to think about it too much.

261
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
It's almost reflexive for you now,

262
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,990
which means that a lot of the information

263
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,580
about how to perform
that particular movement

264
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,300
has been passed off to
circuitry that's now

265
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,290
more or less in the brainstem
and below the motor cortex.

266
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,410
Now, why am I giving you all this detail?

267
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,240
Well, if you want to
change motor patterns,

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,780
you have to know where in the
circuitry changes are possible

269
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,290
and you ought to know where the changes

270
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,340
are most likely to occur.

271
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,230
You also need to know, how
do you signal to the brain

272
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,550
and nervous system that
a change is necessary?

273
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,610
So let's just pause there,

274
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,830
return to the initial
question that we started with,

275
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,230
which is, does the brain control behavior?

276
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,760
And the answer is yes,
and now you know how.

277
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,820
It's upper motor neurons,
lower motor neurons,

278
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,720
you've got these things called
central pattern generators

279
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
and some connection with the muscle.

280
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,350
So there you go, you just got,

281
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,320
basically, what was the equivalent of

282
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,300
the introduction to a college lecture

283
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,600
on motor control and the nervous system.

284
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,270
But the point today is
all about plasticity.

285
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,960
How can that be leveraged
in order to open up

286
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,760
this magical thing that we call plasticity

287
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,530
in order to access changes
to our emotional experience,

288
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,520
or to our belief system,

289
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,550
or to our ability to remember

290
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,410
and use specific kinds of information

291
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,440
for say math, or language, et cetera?

292
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,560
Well, what I'm not going
to tell you is that

293
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,380
you need to go running
or you need to go biking,

294
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,300
or that simply going
through motor patterns

295
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,330
is going to open up plasticity because

296
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,000
I hate to tell you this, but
as beneficial as exercise is,

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
it does not open plasticity
unless you do certain things.

298
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,470
And I will tell you exactly

299
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,670
what those certain things are today.

300
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,170
To be clear, I think exercise
is wonderful and healthy,

301
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,700
can improve cardiovascular function,

302
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,450
maintain strength, bone
density, all that good stuff.

303
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,470
But just working out or doing
your exercise of various kinds

304
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,720
will not change your nervous system.

305
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,930
It will maintain it,

306
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,360
and it can certainly improve
other health metrics,

307
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,963
but it is not going to open
up the window for plasticity.

308
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,720
The question we need to ask

309
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,300
is can behavior change the brain?

310
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,280
We already agree that the
brain can change behavior,

311
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,260
but can behavior change the brain?

312
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,780
And the answer is yes,

313
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,630
provided that behavior is
different enough in specific ways

314
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,860
from the behaviors that you
already know how to perform.

315
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,950
Let me repeat that.

316
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,930
Can behavior change the brain?

317
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,470
And the answer is yes,

318
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,200
provided that behavior is different enough

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,510
from the sorts of behaviors

320
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,980
that you already know how to perform.

321
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,320
And I should've added the word well.

322
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,790
Because you can't obviously
perform a behavior

323
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,580
that you don't know how to perform

324
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,960
because you don't know how to do it yet.

325
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,470
But there's a key element
to accessing neuroplasticity

326
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,040
that frankly I don't see out there

327
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,100
in the general discussion
about neuroplasticity.

328
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,260
In the general discussion
about neuroplasticity

329
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,070
and about learning, I hear
all these gimmicks about using

330
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,270
different ways to remember
lots of people's names

331
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,670
and arranging things
into their first letters

332
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,350
and mnemonics and all this kind of stuff,

333
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,653
which, frankly, to me
feels really gimmicky.

334
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,360
I think that if you
look at super learners,

335
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,000
they tend to be people that have a process

336
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,470
of say extreme memory.

337
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,820
But people who have
extreme memory, generally,

338
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,703
the literature shows us, are
pretty poor at other things.

339
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,270
I don't think most of us are
interested in walking around

340
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,900
knowing how to remember everything.

341
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,940
In fact, there are some
interesting studies

342
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,660
looking at humans who over-remember,

343
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,070
and they suffer tremendously

344
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,570
because they remember all sorts of things,

345
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,210
like the number at the top of the receipt

346
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,460
at the bodega that they bought
a Coca-Cola 10 years ago.

347
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,170
This is useless information
for most people.

348
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,000
They don't do well in life, really.

349
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,770
So the goal isn't to remember everything,

350
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,670
the goal is to be selective
about your brain changes.

351
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,230
And when we talk about brain changes,

352
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,340
I want to highlight adaptive changes.

353
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,730
There's a whole category of
things that we're going to discuss

354
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,050
when we talk about traumatic
brain injury and dementia,

355
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,520
a topic for a future episode,

356
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,170
about all the things that happen when you

357
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,550
have damaged your nervous system
or you're missing neurons.

358
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,670
But, today, I really want to talk about

359
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,450
something that I think
is very near and dear

360
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,570
to many of your hearts, which is

361
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,920
what are the behaviors
that you can engage in

362
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,190
to access neuroplasticity

363
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,450
so that then you can apply that plasticity

364
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,473
to the specific things that
you want to learn or unlearn.

365
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,270
This is very important
because I don't want people to

366
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,130
get the impression that
we're really talking about

367
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,920
learning a bunch of motor movements.

368
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,870
You may be an athlete, you
might not be an athlete.

369
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,290
You might want to learn how
to dance, you might not.

370
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,580
You might want to learn how to dance

371
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,150
and get better at remembering

372
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,830
and learning languages, for instance,

373
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,760
or at unlearning some
difficult emotional experience,

374
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,730
meaning you want to
remove the emotional load

375
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,120
from a particular memory of an experience.

376
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,790
What we're talking about today
is using behavior as a gate

377
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,880
to enter states of mind and body

378
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,933
that allow you to access plasticity.

379
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,260
So let's talk about the
different kinds of plasticity

380
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,450
that are available to us.

381
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,520
Because those will point directly

382
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,840
towards the type of protocols
that we should engage in

383
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,620
to change ourselves for the better,

384
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,533
the so-called adaptive plasticity.

385
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,790
There is something called
representational plasticity.

386
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,290
Representational plasticity is just your

387
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,320
internal representation
of the outside world.

388
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,260
So you have a map of auditory
space, believe it or not,

389
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,100
meaning you have neurons that respond

390
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,340
when something over on my right happens,

391
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,410
like I'm [snaps fingers]
snapping my fingers

392
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,243
over to my right.

393
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:07,580
I can't snap as well on my left,

394
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,224
which is the whole thing unto itself.

395
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:11,057
[snaps fingers]

396
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,880
Yeah, weak over there on the left side.

397
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,440
But when I do that,

398
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,360
there are different
neurons respond to those.

399
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,270
We have a map of visual space.

400
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,540
Certain neurons are seeing things

401
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,670
in certain portions of
visual space and not others.

402
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,330
We have a map of motor space,

403
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,810
meaning when we move our limbs
in particular directions,

404
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,060
we know where those limbs are

405
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,240
because even if we can't see them,

406
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,470
we have what's called
proprioceptive feedback.

407
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,620
So we have knowledge
about where our limbs are.

408
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,330
In fact, people that lack certain neurons

409
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,100
for proprioceptive feedback,

410
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,160
they are very poor at
controlling their motor behavior.

411
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,260
They get injured a lot.

412
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,580
It's actually a terrible situation.

413
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,960
So we've got all these
representations inside

414
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,210
and we have maps of our motor commands.

415
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,100
We know that, for instance,
if I want to reach out

416
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,210
and grab the pen in front of me,

417
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,510
that I need to generate a
certain amount of force.

418
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,053
So I rarely overshoot,
I rarely miss the pen.

419
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,520
Our maps of the motor world

420
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,453
and our maps of the
sensory world are merged.

421
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,560
The way to create plasticity

422
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,339
is to create mismatches or
errors in how we perform things.

423
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,329
And this I think is an amazing

424
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,129
and important feature of neuroplasticity

425
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,053
that is highly underappreciated.

426
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,850
The way to create plasticity

427
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,370
is to send signals to the
brain that something is wrong,

428
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,860
something is different, and
something isn't being achieved.

429
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,500
I think this will completely reframe

430
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,280
the way that most people
think about plasticity.

431
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,187
Most of us think about plasticity as,

432
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,620
"Okay, we're going to get into this

433
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,970
optimal learning state or flow,

434
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,280
and then suddenly we're going to be able

435
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,510
to do all the things that
we wish that we could do."

436
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,460
Well, I hate to break it to you, but flow

437
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,960
is an expression of what
we already know how to do.

438
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,800
It is not a state for learning.

439
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,330
And I'm willing to go to bat with any of

440
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,920
the flo-wa-nis-tas out there

441
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,730
that want to challenge me on that one.

442
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,010
Flow is an expression of
nervous system capabilities

443
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,780
that are already embedded in us.

444
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,700
Errors and making errors

445
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,100
out of sync with what we would like to do

446
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,410
is how our nervous system is cued

447
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,010
through very distinct
biological mechanisms

448
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,510
that something isn't going right.

449
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,710
And, therefore, certain
neurochemicals are deployed

450
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,970
that signal the neural circuits
that they have to change.

451
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,530
So let's talk about the experiments

452
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,670
that support what I just said.

453
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,230
'Cause I'm about to tell
you that making errors

454
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,330
over and over and over again

455
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,300
is the route to shaping
your nervous system

456
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,110
so that it performs better
and better and better.

457
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,700
And I'm not going to tell you

458
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,970
that the last rep of a set
where you hit failure in the gym

459
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,330
is anything like neuroplasticity.

460
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,250
You hear that too that it's
pushing to that point of a cliff

461
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,940
where you just can't function anymore,

462
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,860
that's the signal.

463
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,940
That's not the signal.

464
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,850
That's a distinct neuromuscular phenomenon

465
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,570
that bears zero resemblance

466
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,760
to what it takes to get neuroplasticity.

467
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,610
So let's talk about
errors and making errors

468
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,770
and why and how that triggers
the release of chemicals

469
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,170
that then allow us to not just

470
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,900
learn the thing that we're
doing in the motor sense,

471
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,990
play the piano, dance, et cetera,

472
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,040
but it also creates an environment,

473
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,830
a milieu within the brain,

474
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,470
that allows us to then go
learn how to couple or uncouple

475
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,250
a particular emotion to an experience,

476
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,850
or better language learning,

477
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,780
or better mathematical learning.

478
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,230
It's a really fundamental
aspect of how we're built.

479
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,030
And when you look at it, it's
actually very straightforward.

480
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,940
It's a series of logical steps

481
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,160
that once you learn how
to open those hatches,

482
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,050
it becomes very straightforward to deploy.

483
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,500
Last episode, we discussed

484
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,550
some of the basic principles
of neuroplasticity.

485
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,660
If you didn't hear that episode,

486
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,330
no problem, I'll just review it quickly,

487
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,770
which is that it's a falsehood

488
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,400
that everything that we do and
experience changes our brain.

489
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,640
The brain changes when
certain neurochemicals,

490
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,110
namely acetylcholine,
epinephrin, and dopamine,

491
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,910
are released in ways and
in the specific times

492
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,860
that allow for neural circuits
to be marked for change.

493
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,170
And then the change
occurs later during sleep.

494
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,990
I'll review that later, but, basically,

495
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,630
you need a certain cocktail of chemicals

496
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,150
released in the brain in order
for a particular behavior

497
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,660
to reshape the way that our brain works.

498
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,920
So the question really is

499
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,620
what allows those
neurochemicals to be released?

500
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,990
And last episode, I
talked all about focus.

501
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,540
If you haven't seen it
or heard that episode,

502
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,810
you might want to check it out,

503
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,090
about some specific tools and practices

504
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,780
that can allow you to build
up your capacity for focus

505
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,360
and release certain
chemicals in that cocktail.

506
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,460
But, today, we're going to talk about

507
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,590
the other chemicals in the
cocktail, in particular dopamine.

508
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,510
And we're really going to
center our discussion around

509
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,860
this issue of making errors

510
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,800
and why making errors
is actually the signal

511
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,050
that tells the brain,
"Okay, it's time to change,"

512
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,310
or, more generally, it's time
to pay attention to things

513
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,250
so that you change.

514
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,430
And I really want to distinguish
this point really clearly,

515
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,630
which is that I'm going
to talk today a lot about

516
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,930
motor and vestibular,
meaning balance programs,

517
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,840
but not just for learning
motor commands and balance,

518
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,770
not just for learning new
motor skills and balance,

519
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,670
but also for setting a stage

520
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,420
or a kind of condition in your brain

521
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,620
where you can go learn
other things as well.

522
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,570
Let's talk about some classic experiments

523
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,990
that really nail down

524
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,676
what's most important in this
discussion about plasticity.

525
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:34,790
As I mentioned last episode,

526
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,500
and I'll just tell you right now again,

527
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,050
the brain is incredibly plastic

528
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,080
from about birth until about age 25.

529
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
Passive experience will shape the brain

530
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,920
just because of the way that the chemicals

531
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,420
that are sloshing around in there

532
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,080
and the way that the neurons are arranged

533
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,230
and all sorts of things.

534
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,660
The brain's job is to customize itself

535
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,120
in response to its experience.

536
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,340
And then somewhere about 25,

537
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,680
it's not like the day
after your 26th birthday,

538
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,070
plasticity closes,

539
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,650
there's a kind of tapering
off of plasticity,

540
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,330
and you need different
mechanisms to engage plasticity

541
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,253
as an adult.

542
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,560
We're mostly going to be talking
about adult plasticity today,

543
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,447
but I got a lot of questions about,

544
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,980
"Well, what about if I'm younger than 25?"

545
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,543
First of all, that's great.

546
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:22,240
I wish I had a time machine, but I don't.

547
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,870
Because as I've said before,

548
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,580
the stinger is when you're young,

549
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,710
your brain is very plastic,

550
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,660
but you have less control
over your experience.

551
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,230
When you're older, generally,

552
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,397
you have more control of your experience,

553
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,400
but your brain is less plastic.

554
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,120
So if you're already asking the question

555
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,720
as a 20-year-old or a
15-year-old, "What can I do now

556
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,270
that's really going to enhanced my brain?"

557
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,640
I guess the simple
answer would be an aside,

558
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,690
which would be get the broadest
education you can possible.

559
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,640
That means math, chemistry,
physics, literature, music,

560
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,800
learn how to play an instrument.

561
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,490
I'm saying that 'cause
I wish I had, et cetera.

562
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,610
Get a broad training in a number of things

563
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,050
and find the thing that really

564
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,800
captures your passion and excitement,

565
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,260
and then put a ton of
additional effort there.

566
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,600
That's what I recommend,

567
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,520
including emotional development.

568
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,600
Maybe a topic for a future episode.

569
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,590
But if you are an adult,

570
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,660
or if you are a young person,

571
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,800
knowing how to tap into
these plasticity mechanisms

572
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,840
is very powerful.

573
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,700
You need these chemicals
deployed in the nervous system

574
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,080
in order to mark whatever nerve cells

575
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,730
happen to be firing in the
time afterward for change.

576
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,597
And people are obsessed with asking,

577
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:34,390
"What supplements, what
drugs, what conditions,

578
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,030
what machines will allow for that?"

579
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,540
But there's a natural set of
conditions that allow for that.

580
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,400
When we came into this world,

581
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,103
we learned to take our
different maps of experience,

582
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,500
our motor maps, our auditory
maps, our visual maps.

583
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,880
And to link them, we align those maps.

584
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,040
The simplest example is
the one I gave before.

585
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,950
If I hear something off to my
right, like I click like that,

586
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,210
it could come from my fingers snapping

587
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,760
or it could come from something

588
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,340
generated by somebody else or
something else to my right,

589
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,400
I look to my right.

590
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,940
If I hear it on the
left, I look to my left.

591
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,620
If I hear it right in front of me,

592
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,910
I keep looking right in front of me.

593
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,990
And if I hear it behind me, I turn around.

594
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,760
And that's because our
maps of visual space

595
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,320
and our maps of auditory space

596
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,900
and our maps of motor space

597
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,170
are aligned to one another
in perfect register.

598
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,190
It's an incredible feature
of our nervous system.

599
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,370
It takes place in a structure

600
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,740
called the superior colliculus,

601
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,950
although you don't need to know that name.

602
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,880
Superior colliculus has layers,

603
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,660
literally stacks of
neurons like in a sandwich

604
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,560
where the zero point right in front of me,

605
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,040
or maybe 10 or 15 degrees off to my right

606
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,260
or 10 or 15 degrees off to my left,

607
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,590
are aligned so that the auditory neurons,

608
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,540
the ones that care about sounds,

609
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,380
at 15 degrees to my right,

610
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,500
sit directly below the neurons

611
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,080
that look at 15 degrees to
my right in my visual system.

612
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,130
And when I reach over to this direction,

613
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,000
there's a signal that's sent
down through those layers

614
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,780
that says 15 degrees off to the right

615
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,200
is the direction to look,
it's the direction to listen,

616
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,250
and it's the direction to
move if I need to move.

617
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,750
So there's an alignment.

618
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,970
And this is really powerful.

619
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,960
And this is what allows
us to move through space

620
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,260
and function in our lives
in a really fluid way.

621
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,270
It's set up during development.

622
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,930
But there have been some
important experiments

623
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,900
that have revealed that
these maps are plastic,

624
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,160
meaning they can shift, they're
subject to neuroplasticity.

625
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,320
And there are specific rules
that allow us to shift them.

626
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,830
So here's the key experiment.

627
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,630
The key experiment was
done by a colleague of mine

628
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,490
who's now retired but whose
work is absolutely fundamental

629
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,330
in the field of
neuroplasticity, Eric Knudsen.

630
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,460
The Knudsen Lab,

631
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,760
and many of the Knudsen
Lab scientific offspring,

632
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,380
showed that if one is
to wear prism glasses

633
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,343
that shift the visual field,

634
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,090
that eventually there'll be a shift

635
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,560
in the representation of
the auditory motor maps too.

636
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,960
Now, what they initially did is

637
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,073
they looked at young subjects,

638
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,120
and what they did is they
moved the visual world

639
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,470
by making them wear prism glasses.

640
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,830
So that, for instance, if
my pen is out in front of me

641
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,650
at five degrees off center,

642
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,920
so just a little bit off center,

643
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,180
if you're listening to
this, this would be like

644
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,330
just a little bit to my right,

645
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,490
but in these prism glasses,

646
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,800
I actually see that pen
way over far on my right.

647
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,940
So it's actually here,
but I see it over there

648
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,950
because I'm wearing prisms on my eyes.

649
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,860
What happens is in the first day or so,

650
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,150
you ask people or you ask
animal subjects or whatever

651
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,400
to reach for this object,

652
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,440
and they reach to the wrong place

653
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,593
because they're seeing it where it isn't.

654
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,950
This gets especially complicated

655
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,400
when you start including sounds.

656
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,630
When you have a thing off to
your right making a sound,

657
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,750
but the thing is actually right here.

658
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,890
So you're hearing the
sound at one location

659
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,180
and you're seeing the
object at another location

660
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,650
because you're wearing these prisms.

661
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,393
So your image of the world
is totally distorted.

662
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,890
Or, in experiments done by other groups,

663
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,350
they wear glasses,

664
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,070
subjects wore glasses
that completely invert

665
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,660
the visual world so that
everything is upside down,

666
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,100
which is an extreme example
of these representational maps

667
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,543
being flipped or shifted.

668
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,800
But what you find is that
in young individuals,

669
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,610
within a day or two,

670
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,630
they start adjusting their motor behavior

671
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,730
in exactly the right way

672
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,110
so that they always reach
to the correct location.

673
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,760
So they hear a sound at one location,

674
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,270
they see the object that
ought to make that sound

675
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,600
at a different location,

676
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,160
and they somehow are able to
adjust their motor behavior

677
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,520
to reach to the correct location.

678
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,710
It's incredible.

679
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,770
It's absolutely incredible.

680
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,762
Or, in the case of the people

681
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:55,870
who would look at the world upside down,

682
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,820
they somehow are able to
navigate this upside down world

683
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,880
even though we're completely used to

684
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,010
our feet being on the floor
and not on the ceiling

685
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,160
and people not walking at us

686
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,360
by hanging off the ceiling like bats.

687
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,550
Amazing.

688
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,050
And what it tells us is that these maps

689
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,570
that are aligned to one another

690
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,530
can move and shift and rotate,

691
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,650
and even flip themselves.

692
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,240
And it happens best in young individuals.

693
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,810
If you do this in older individuals,

694
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,780
in most cases, it takes a very long time

695
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,790
for the maps to shift,

696
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,620
and in some cases they never shift.

697
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,730
So this is a very experimental scenario,

698
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,500
but it's an important one to understand

699
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,870
because it really tamps down the fact

700
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,110
that we have the capacity
to create dramatic shifts

701
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,260
in our representation
of the outside world.

702
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,530
So how can we get plasticity as adults

703
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,330
that mimics the plasticity

704
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,190
that we get when we are juveniles?

705
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,210
Well, the Knudsen Lab and
other labs have looked at this,

706
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,990
and it's really interesting.

707
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,060
First of all, we have to ask,

708
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,740
what is the signal for plasticity?

709
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,810
Is it just having prism glasses on?

710
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,780
No, because they did that
experiment and ruled that out.

711
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,720
Is it just the fact that the visual thing

712
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:11,410
appears to be far over to my right

713
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,090
when in fact it's right in front of me?

714
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,050
No.

715
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,870
The signal that generates the plasticity

716
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,220
is the making of errors.

717
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,520
It's the reaches and failures

718
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,080
that signal to the nervous system

719
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,170
that this is not working.

720
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,670
And, therefore, the shifts
start to take place.

721
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,700
And this is so fundamentally important

722
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,687
because I think most people think,

723
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,490
"Oh, well, practice is going to be

724
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,370
I have to access beginner's mind,"

725
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,670
which is a great concept, actually,

726
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,860
it's about approaching things
expecting to make errors,

727
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,693
which is great.

728
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:47,370
I think I am a believer
in beginner's mind.

729
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,930
But people understandably get frustrated,

730
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,670
like they're trying to
learn a piece on the piano

731
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,130
and they can't do it,

732
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,510
or they're trying to
write a piece of code,

733
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,587
or they're trying to access
some sort of motor behavior,

734
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,930
and they can't do it,

735
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,785
and the frustration drives them crazy,

736
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:01,940
[indistinct] "I can't
do it, I can't do it,"

737
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,570
when they don't realize that
[laughs] the errors themselves

738
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,517
are signaling to the
brain and nervous system,

739
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:09,030
"Something's not working."

740
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,040
And of course the brain doesn't understand

741
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,320
the words something isn't working.

742
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,080
The brain doesn't even
understand frustration

743
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,690
as an emotional state.

744
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,760
The brain understands the
neurochemicals that are released,

745
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,730
namely epinephrine and acetylcholine,

746
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,320
but also, and we'll get into this,

747
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,580
the molecule dopamine

748
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,250
when we start to approximate
the correct behavior

749
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,960
just a little bit,

750
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,300
and we start getting a little bit right.

751
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,050
So what happens is when we make errors,

752
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,670
the nervous system kind of,

753
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,790
I don't want to say freaks
out because it's a very

754
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,420
mechanistic and controlled situation,

755
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,120
but the nervous system starts
releasing neurotransmitters

756
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,600
and neuromodulators

757
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,000
that say, "We better change
something in the circuitry."

758
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,280
And so errors are the basis [laughs]

759
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,330
for neuroplasticity and for learning.

760
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,440
And I wish that this was
more prominent out there.

761
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,550
I guess this is why I'm saying it.

762
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,040
And humans do not like
this feeling of frustration

763
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,260
and making errors.

764
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,450
The few that do do exceedingly
well in whatever pursuits

765
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,110
they happen to be involved in.

766
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,070
The ones that don't,
generally don't do well.

767
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,560
They generally don't learn much.

768
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,410
And if you think about it,

769
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,020
why would your nervous system ever change?

770
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,500
Why would it ever change?

771
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,810
Unless there was
something to be afraid of,

772
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,090
something that made us feel awful

773
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,400
will signal that the nervous
system needs to change,

774
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,820
or there's an error in our performance.

775
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,070
So it turns out that the
feedback of these errors,

776
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,600
the reaching to the wrong location

777
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,920
starts to release a number of things.

778
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,620
And now you've heard
about them many times,

779
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,970
but this would be epinephrin.

780
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,270
It increases alertness,

781
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,810
acetylcholine, focus.

782
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,690
And this is why frustration

783
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,130
that leads us to just kind of quit

784
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,130
and walk away from the endeavor
is the absolute worst thing.

785
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,110
Because if acetylcholine is released,

786
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,260
it creates an opportunity to
focus on the error margin,

787
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,200
the distance between what
it is that you're doing

788
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,840
and what it is that you would like to do.

789
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,890
And then the nervous system starts to

790
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,770
make changes almost immediately

791
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,820
in order to try and
get the behavior right.

792
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,120
And when you start getting
it even a little bit right,

793
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,010
that third molecule comes
online or is released,

794
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,280
which is dopamine,

795
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,280
which allows for the plastic
changes to occur very fast.

796
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,250
Now, this is what all
happens very naturally

797
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,360
in young brains.

798
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,550
But in old brains, it
tends to be pretty slow,

799
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,250
except for in two conditions.

800
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,970
So let me just pause and just say this,

801
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,420
if you are uncomfortable making errors

802
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,143
and you get frustrated easily,

803
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:37,550
if you leverage that frustration

804
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,150
toward drilling deeper into the endeavor,

805
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,480
you are setting yourself up for a terrific

806
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,070
set of plasticity mechanisms to engage.

807
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,420
But if you take that frustration

808
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,410
and you walk away from the endeavor,

809
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,320
you are essentially setting up plasticity

810
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,290
to rewire you according to
what happens afterwards,

811
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,380
which is generally
feeling pretty miserable.

812
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,190
So now you can kind of start to appreciate

813
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,060
why it is that continuing
to drill into a process

814
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,300
to the point of frustration

815
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,530
but then staying with that
process for a little bit longer,

816
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,950
and I'll define exactly
what I mean by a little bit,

817
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,950
is the most important
thing for adult learning

818
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,690
as well as childhood learning,

819
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,230
but adult learning in particular.

820
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,700
Now, the Knudsen Lab did two

821
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,210
very important sets of experiments.

822
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,670
The first one was published in "Nature,'

823
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,610
very important study,

824
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:31,060
which showed that juveniles
can make these massive shifts

825
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,300
in their map representations,

826
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,980
meaning you can shift the visual world

827
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,790
using visual prisms a huge
amount and very quickly.

828
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,940
Young individuals can

829
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,483
shift their representations of the world

830
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:44,170
so that they learn to reach
to the correct location.

831
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,560
They get a lot of plasticity all at once,

832
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,350
and it happens very fast in a
period of just a couple days.

833
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,210
In adults, it tends to be very slow

834
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,800
and most individuals
never actually accomplish

835
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,880
the full map shift.

836
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,680
They don't get the plasticity.

837
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,760
Here we're talking about map shifts,

838
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,670
but this could be learning a new language,

839
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,130
this could be any number
of different things

840
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,360
that [indistinct] we're attempting.

841
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,590
So what we're saying is
what I already said before,

842
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,750
which is that we learn
very well as youngsters,

843
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,543
but not as adults after 25.

844
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,409
But then what they did

845
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:20,719
is they started making the
increment of change smaller.

846
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,539
So instead of shifting
the world a huge amount

847
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,800
by putting prisms that
shifted that the visual world

848
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,409
all the way over to the right,

849
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,799
they did this incrementally.

850
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,270
So, first, they put on prisms

851
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,340
that shifted it just a little bit,

852
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,080
just like seven degrees I
believe was the exact number.

853
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,860
And then it was 14 degrees,

854
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,270
and then it was 28 degrees.

855
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,989
And so what they found was
that the adult nervous system

856
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:47,239
can tolerate smaller and
smaller errors over time,

857
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,619
but that you can stack those errors

858
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,280
so that you can get a lot of plasticity.

859
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,520
Put simply, incremental
learning as an adult

860
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,810
is absolutely essential.

861
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,980
You are not going to get massive shifts

862
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,150
in your representation
to the outside world.

863
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,600
So how do you make small errors
as opposed to big errors?

864
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Well, the key is smaller
bouts of focused learning

865
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,223
for smaller bits of information.

866
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,120
It's a mistake to try and
learn a lot of information

867
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,610
in one learning about as an adult.

868
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,030
What these papers from
the Knudsen Lab show,

869
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,200
and what others have gone on to show,

870
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,340
is that the adult nervous
system is fully capable of

871
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,350
engaging in a huge amount of plasticity,

872
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,490
but you need to do it
in smaller increments

873
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,950
per learning epoch or
per learning episode.

874
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,880
So how would you do this?

875
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,950
Well, say for instance, I'm
terrible at free throws,

876
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,650
so let's say I wanted
to learn free throws.

877
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,573
I'm 45 years old, so I'm well
past the 25 and under mark.

878
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,662
I'm going to make errors.

879
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:50,650
I'm going to make a lot errors.

880
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,600
If I go into learning free throws

881
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,600
knowing that errors are
the gate to plasticity,

882
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,870
well, then I feel a little bit better,

883
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,990
but I still have to aim for

884
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,140
the rim of the basket or the net.

885
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,410
Basically, showing how little
I know about basketball.

886
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,660
But I think I know the general
themes around basketball,

887
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,550
involves a net, a back
board, and a ball, of course.

888
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,870
So I go to the free throw
line and I'll throw.

889
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,750
How long should I go?

890
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,423
Well, until I'm hitting
the point of frustration.

891
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,890
And at that point, continuing probably for

892
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,850
anywhere from 10 to 100 more trials

893
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,900
should be my limit, right?

894
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,970
That should be my limit if I want to

895
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,060
improve some specific aspect
of the motor behavior.

896
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,070
And so the question then is

897
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,650
what should I be paying attention to?

898
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,670
What should I be focusing on?

899
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,880
Well, obviously trying to
get the ball into the basket.

900
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,530
But the beauty of motor learning

901
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,180
is that the circuits for
auditory and visual and motor

902
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,120
more or less teach themselves.

903
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,150
I don't necessarily have
to be paying attention to

904
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,700
exactly the contact of
my fingers with the ball

905
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
or some random feature like

906
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,180
whether or not I'm
bending my knees or not.

907
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,260
The key is to try a number
of different parameters

908
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,160
until I start to approximate

909
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,310
the behavior that I want
to get a little bit better,

910
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,670
and then trying to get
consistent about that.

911
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,757
Now, many of you involved
in sports learning will say,

912
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:11,800
"Okay, well, that's obvious,

913
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,420
it's just incremental learning."

914
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,860
But the key thing is in those errors.

915
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,920
By isolating the errors and
making a number of errors

916
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,120
in a particular aspect
of the motor movement,

917
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,240
it signals to the brain that it's plastic.

918
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,520
And if I leave that episode of going

919
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,050
and trying to learn how
to shoot free throws,

920
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,670
my brain is still plastic.

921
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,940
Plasticity is a state of the
brain and nervous system.

922
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,160
It's not just geared
toward the specific thing

923
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,370
I'm trying to learn.

924
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,210
So there are two aspects to plasticity

925
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,450
that I think we really need to highlight.

926
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,300
One is that there's
plasticity geared toward

927
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,800
the thing that you are
trying to learn specifically.

928
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,920
And then there are states of mind and body

929
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,750
that allow us to access plasticity.

930
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,170
Now, toward the end of this episode,

931
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,880
I'm going to spell out specific protocols

932
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,820
in a little more detail.

933
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,960
That free throw example

934
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,770
might not correlate with
what you want to learn.

935
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,820
Actually, I don't have a huge
desire to learn free throws.

936
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,203
I've more or less given up on basketball,

937
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,600
and free throws in particular.

938
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,340
But I think that it's
important to understand

939
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,530
that motor movements are
the most straightforward way

940
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,440
to access states of plasticity.

941
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,670
And that can be for sake of
learning the motor movement

942
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,363
or for sake of accessing
plasticity more generally.

943
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,240
One very important aspect to
getting plasticity as an adult

944
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,670
is not just smaller increments,
meaning shorter bouts.

945
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,990
So I gave an example of

946
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,520
another 100 free throws or something,

947
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,040
but going out there and just
getting 10,000 free throws

948
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,320
all at once or packing as
much as I can into one episode

949
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,540
is not going to be as efficient for me

950
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,760
as shorter bouts of intense
learning as an adult.

951
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,250
Because the error signals
are not as well-defined

952
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,090
to my nervous system.

953
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,197
It's not going to know
what needs to change.

954
00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:55,980
And so this is really the key element

955
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,260
of incremental learning,

956
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,190
is that you're trying to
signal to the nervous system

957
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,130
at least one component
that needs to change.

958
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,090
The nervous system needs
to know what the error is.

959
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,880
Now, when I shoot free throws, Lord knows

960
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,670
there are a lot of different
kinds of errors that happen,

961
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,910
probably the way I'm bending my knees,

962
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,540
the arc of the ball, the way
I'm organizing my shoulders,

963
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,150
probably where my eyes
are, lots of things.

964
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,490
So which ones to focus on?

965
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,260
And that's what I said before,

966
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,730
the beauty of the motor system is

967
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,880
I don't have to worry about all of that.

968
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,430
I just need to get the
reps in a number of times,

969
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,410
and the nervous system will figure out

970
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,490
how far off my motor commands are,

971
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,850
at the level of these maps
that I described earlier,

972
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,850
how far those deviate
from the desired behavior,

973
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,150
getting the ball into the basket,

974
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,570
and it will start making adjustments.

975
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,060
But as I make adjustments,

976
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,340
or as my nervous system
makes adjustments for me,

977
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,550
the key thing is to not start adding

978
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,240
a variety of new errors
because then it gets confused.

979
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,300
And so this is why short learning bouts

980
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,910
are absolutely essential.

981
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,080
So let's say it's for learning
an instrument as an adult.

982
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,480
Probably anywhere from 7 minutes

983
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,510
to 30 minutes,

984
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:09,290
provided that you're fully
attending, you're very focused,

985
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,810
is going to be a pretty
significant stimulus

986
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,370
to inspire plasticity
in the nervous system.

987
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,050
Now, there is one way to
get a lot of plasticity

988
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,220
all at once as an adult.

989
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,840
There is that kind of Holy Grail thing of

990
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,410
getting massive plasticity

991
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,410
as you would when you were a
young person but as an adult.

992
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,800
And the Knudsen Lab revealed this

993
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,800
by setting a very serious
contingency on the learning.

994
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,090
What they did was they
had a situation where

995
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,330
subjects had to find food

996
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,120
that was displaced in their visual world,

997
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,690
again, by putting prisms,

998
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,190
and they had to find the food,

999
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,740
and the food made a noise,

1000
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,700
there was a noise set to kind
of the location of the food

1001
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,670
through an array of speakers.

1002
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,790
Basically, what they found was that

1003
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,280
if people have to adjust
their visual world

1004
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,690
in order to get food,

1005
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,390
the plasticity would eventually occur,

1006
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,860
but it was very slow as an adult.

1007
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,173
It was very, very slow.

1008
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,823
Unless they actually
had to hunt that food.

1009
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,000
In order to eat at all,
they needed plasticity.

1010
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,420
And then what happened was remarkable.

1011
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,940
What they observed is that
the plasticity as an adult

1012
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,860
can be as dramatic, as robust
as it is in a young person

1013
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,300
or in a young animal subject,

1014
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,040
provided that there's a serious incentive

1015
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,220
for the plasticity to occur.

1016
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,450
And this is absolutely
important to understand,

1017
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,160
which is that how badly we
need or want the plasticity

1018
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,810
determines how fast that
plasticity will arrive,

1019
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,720
which is incredible because

1020
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,180
the brain is just neurons
and soup of chemicals.

1021
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,700
But this means that the
importance of something,

1022
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,510
how important something is to us,

1023
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,820
actually gates the rate of plasticity

1024
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,990
and the magnitude of plasticity.

1025
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:06,270
And this is why just passively
going through most things,

1026
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,930
going through the motions, as we say,

1027
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,750
or just getting our
reps in quote, unquote,

1028
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,930
is not sufficient to get the
nervous system to change.

1029
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,423
This study, a beautiful study,

1030
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,860
published in the journal
of neuroscience shows

1031
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,820
that if we actually have to

1032
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,510
accomplish something in order to eat

1033
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,940
or in order to get our ration of income,

1034
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,250
we will reshape our nervous
system very, very quickly.

1035
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,800
So the nervous system has a capacity

1036
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,310
to change at a tremendous rate,

1037
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:43,600
to an enormous degree at any stage of life

1038
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,870
provided it's important
enough that that happen.

1039
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,347
And I think some of you might be saying,

1040
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:49,770
"Well, duh, that's obvious.

1041
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,190
If it's really crucial,

1042
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,280
then, of course, it's
going to change faster."

1043
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,090
But it didn't have to be that way.

1044
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,680
And for most people who
are trying to learn how to

1045
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,350
learn faster or learn better,

1046
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,280
they probably, in most cases,

1047
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,130
they are hitting a limit

1048
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,840
because the need to change
is not crucial enough.

1049
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,680
And I think there are a number of places

1050
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,300
where this has important relevance

1051
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,680
in the people who are battling
addiction, for instance.

1052
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,350
I will be the first to say that

1053
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,090
I sympathize with the fact that addictions

1054
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,730
have a biological component.

1055
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,970
There's clearly cases where people

1056
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,230
struggle tremendously
to change their behavior

1057
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,040
and their nervous system, in
some cases, is so disrupted

1058
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,150
by whatever substance they've been abusing

1059
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,990
or behavior that they've been engaging in,

1060
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,580
that it's that much
harder for them to change.

1061
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,220
But we've also seen incredible
examples where when people

1062
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,630
have to change from an
internal standpoint,

1063
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,690
from their own belief
and desire to change,

1064
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,170
that massive change is possible.

1065
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,180
And so I think that the
studies that Knudsen did

1066
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,020
showing the incremental learning

1067
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,510
can create a huge degree
of plasticity as an adult

1068
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,450
as well as when the
contingency is very high,

1069
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,370
meaning we need to eat, or
we need to make an income,

1070
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,203
or we need to do

1071
00:44:08,203 --> 00:44:11,010
something that's vitally important for us,

1072
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,270
that plasticity can happen
in these enormous leaps

1073
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,160
just like they can in
adolescence and young adulthood.

1074
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,820
That points to the fact that it has to be

1075
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,870
a neurochemical system.

1076
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,710
There has to be an underlying mechanism.

1077
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,510
This wasn't a case of
sticking a wire into the brain

1078
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,290
or taking a particular drug.

1079
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,170
All the chemicals that
we're about to talk about

1080
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,430
are released from drugstores,
if you will, [laughs]

1081
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,860
chemical stores that already
reside in all of our brains.

1082
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,280
And the key is how to
tap into those stores.

1083
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,150
And so we're going to next talk about

1084
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,360
what are the specific behaviors

1085
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,490
that liberate particular
categories of chemicals

1086
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,540
that allow us to make the
most of incremental learning

1087
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,540
and that set the stage for
plasticity that is similar enough

1088
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,670
or mimics these high contingency states,

1089
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,930
like the need to get food,

1090
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,940
or really create a sense
of internal urgency,

1091
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,030
chemical urgency, if you will.

1092
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,200
If you've heard previous
episodes of this podcast,

1093
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,230
you may have heard me talk
about ultradian rhythm,

1094
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,820
which are these 90-minute rhythms

1095
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,280
that break up our 24-hour day.

1096
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,610
They help break up our sleep
into different cycles of sleep

1097
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,393
like REM sleep and non-REM sleep.

1098
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,400
They break up our day in ways that

1099
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,580
allow us to learn best within
90-minute cycles, et cetera.

1100
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,617
So some of you might be saying,

1101
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:37,137
"Wait, you've been talking
about ultradian cycles,

1102
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,040
and a moment ago you were talking about

1103
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,110
7-minute or 12-minute or
30-minute learning cycles.

1104
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,120
Today, we're really talking
about how to tap into plasticity

1105
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,370
through the completion of a task

1106
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,570
or working towards something
repetitively and making errors.

1107
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,060
And so just to frame this

1108
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,500
in the context of the ultradian cycle,

1109
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,920
you might sit down,

1110
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,110
decide that you're going to
learn conversational French,

1111
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,200
which would mean that you probably

1112
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,600
don't already speak French.

1113
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,890
So you're going to sit down,

1114
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,870
you're going to decide
you're going to learn

1115
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,720
some nouns and some verbs,

1116
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,860
you might do some practice set.

1117
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,710
The ultradian cycle
says that for the first

1118
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,270
5 to 10 minutes of doing that,
your mind is going to drift

1119
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,350
and your focus will probably kick in,

1120
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,910
provided that you're
restricting your visual world

1121
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,760
to just the material in front of you,

1122
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,880
something we talked about last episode,

1123
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,080
somewhere around the 10 or 15-minute mark.

1124
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,850
And then at best you're probably
going to get about an hour of

1125
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:38,430
a deliberate kind of tunnel
vision learning in there.

1126
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,900
Your mind will drift.

1127
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,200
And then toward the end of that,

1128
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,170
what is now an hour and 10
or hour and 20 minute cycle,

1129
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,490
your brain will sort of
start to flicker in and out,

1130
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:50,260
you might start thinking
about what you need to eat

1131
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,080
or the fact that you have to
use the bathroom or something.

1132
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,820
And then by 90 minutes, it's probably time

1133
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,740
to just stop the learning
about and go do something else,

1134
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,090
maybe return for a second
learning about later,

1135
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,210
maybe take a nap afterwards or something

1136
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,180
to enhance the learning.

1137
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,810
It's going to happen within
about a 90-minute block.

1138
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,480
You're going to go through
that cycle of learning.

1139
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,050
But when I refer to the 7 or 12

1140
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,710
or 30 minutes of making errors,

1141
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,464
what I mean is when
you're really in a mode of

1142
00:47:16,464 --> 00:47:19,450
repeating errors, not deliberately,

1143
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,947
you're trying your best
to accomplish something,

1144
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:22,470
and you're failing.

1145
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,001
You're absolutely failing.

1146
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:28,340
You're trying to remember say
the sign language alphabet.

1147
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,110
I was trying to teach
myself this recently,

1148
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,660
and then I keep repeating and repeating,

1149
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,900
and then get to a certain point
where I kept making errors,

1150
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,950
making errors, making errors.

1151
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,820
You want to keep making
errors for this period of time

1152
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,370
that I'm saying will last anywhere

1153
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,670
for about 7 to 30 minutes.

1154
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,950
It is exceedingly frustrating,

1155
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,900
but that frustration, it
liberates the chemical cues

1156
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,990
that signal that
plasticity needs to happen

1157
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:55,283
and they also signal the
particular neurons that are active.

1158
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:57,280
So in the case of sign language,

1159
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,070
it might be the ones that
control my hand movements

1160
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,180
as well as me thinking about
what the different letters are.

1161
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,990
It's signaling different
opponents within the networks

1162
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,540
between the brain and body,

1163
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,887
and it's trying to figure out,

1164
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,900
"Wait, where are these errors coming from?

1165
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,930
Where are the errors coming from?

1166
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,890
Ah, it's those neurons,
they're making the mistakes.

1167
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,220
They're making the mistakes,
they're making the mistakes."

1168
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,610
And it essentially highlights
that pathway for change.

1169
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,470
And it is the case that when we come back

1170
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,850
a day or two later in a
learning about after a nap

1171
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,950
or a night or two of deep rest,

1172
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,847
then what we find is that we
can remember certain things

1173
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:32,400
and the motor pathways work.

1174
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,860
And we don't always get it perfectly,

1175
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,640
but we get a lot of it right.

1176
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,070
Whereas, we got it wrong before.

1177
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:41,460
So that 7 to 30-minute
intense learning about

1178
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,060
is within the ultradian cycle,

1179
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,110
and I want to be clear about that.

1180
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,470
And some people can tolerate
many of these per day.

1181
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,780
Most people can only tolerate
one or two, maybe three.

1182
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,960
This is intense work.

1183
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,940
If shooting free throws, you
could probably do it all day.

1184
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,380
But what I'm talking about

1185
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,320
is really trying to accelerate plasticity

1186
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,320
by having a period of the 7 to
30 minutes per learning about

1187
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:10,440
that is specifically about making errors.

1188
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,540
I want to really underscore that.

1189
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,150
And it's not about, as I mentioned before,

1190
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,150
coming up with some little hack or trick

1191
00:49:18,215 --> 00:49:19,760
or something of that sort.

1192
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,630
It's really about trying to

1193
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,990
cue the nervous system that
something needs to change

1194
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,600
because otherwise it simply won't change.

1195
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,540
Now, there's another aspect to learning,

1196
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,770
I think it's only fair to mention,

1197
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:36,500
which is that we can all learn very easily

1198
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,510
when there's something
very bad happens to us.

1199
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,050
I don't wish this on anyone,

1200
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,480
but it is the case that if
something really terrible happens

1201
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,340
that we will have a lifetime
memory for that event.

1202
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,210
There are processes that
allow us to uncouple

1203
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,630
the emotional load of that event.

1204
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,060
I talked about some of
those a few episodes back,

1205
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,660
the episode on dreams,
trauma, and hallucinations.

1206
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,670
And we're going to return
to trauma release, PTSD,

1207
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,040
and some of those other
themes in a future episode.

1208
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,870
But the reason why negative experiences

1209
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,780
can be wired into us so quickly is because

1210
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,310
our nervous system's main
job is to keep us safe,

1211
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,950
but at a deeper level, it's
because negative experiences

1212
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,820
cue us to the fact that
whatever's happening

1213
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,140
that's really bad is very different

1214
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,133
than the other things that
tend to happen before.

1215
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,230
Most of our experience doesn't remap us,

1216
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,790
but those negative experiences deploy

1217
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,710
high levels of norepinephrine,
high levels of acetylcholine,

1218
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,780
and really make so that

1219
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,370
whatever it is that we
experienced in that bad episode

1220
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,600
is essentially queued up,

1221
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,160
and so we're on the lookout for it.

1222
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,680
And this has a number of negative effects

1223
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,550
in terms of psychological
and emotional effects,

1224
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,410
but it is really a process
designed to keep us safe.

1225
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,420
The other ways in which
we can learn more quickly

1226
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,150
besides just making errors

1227
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,840
is when something really surprises us.

1228
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,350
And if we're positively
surprised by something

1229
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,380
or we are just flooded with
this molecule dopamine,

1230
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,260
then there's a great
opportunity for plasticity.

1231
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,760
Dopamine is a molecule that's
almost always associated

1232
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,950
with pleasure

1233
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:14,250
and with the accomplishment
of a particular goal,

1234
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,690
but it's really also a
molecule of motivation.

1235
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,950
It's a molecule that is
released inside of us

1236
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,130
when we think we're on the right path.

1237
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,940
And it does have a capacity
to increase neuroplasticity,

1238
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,330
motivation, et cetera.

1239
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,040
It's released in response to
a number of natural behaviors,

1240
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,640
just that help with
the progression of ours

1241
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,450
and other species,

1242
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,583
things like food, sex,

1243
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,220
in some sense social connection,

1244
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,760
although that's more serotonin,

1245
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,400
and serotonin doesn't have the same

1246
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,760
effects on plasticity quite the same.

1247
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,360
And we'll talk about a few later.

1248
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,980
But dopamine is when we
think we're on the right path

1249
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,290
toward an external goal,

1250
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,450
a little bit is released

1251
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,080
and it tends to give us more
motivation toward that goal.

1252
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,540
I think everyone could stand
to enhance the rate of learning

1253
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,690
by doing the following.

1254
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,940
Learn to attach dopamine,
in a subjective way,

1255
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,170
to this process of making errors.

1256
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,510
Because that's really combining
two modes of plasticity

1257
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,880
in ways that together can
accelerate the plasticity.

1258
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,830
So, earlier, I talked about making errors

1259
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,510
and having a focus about

1260
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,970
of learning that includes
making a lot of errors

1261
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,410
inside of that learning about.

1262
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,920
That is going to be frustrating,

1263
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,560
but the frustration itself is the cue,

1264
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,990
and epinephrine will be very
high under those conditions.

1265
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,830
But if you can just subjectively

1266
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:39,780
associate that experience
with something good

1267
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,580
and that you want to
continue down that path

1268
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,560
as opposed to quitting

1269
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,920
when you hit the point of frustration,

1270
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,940
well then you now start to

1271
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,540
create a synergy between
the dopamine that's released

1272
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,830
when we subjectively
think something is good,

1273
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,700
or tell ourselves something is good,

1274
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,240
and that situation of making failures.

1275
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,630
In other words, making
failing repetitively,

1276
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:02,030
provided we're engaged in a
very specific set of behaviors

1277
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,090
when we do it,

1278
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,050
as well as telling ourselves
that those failures

1279
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,700
are good for learning and good for us,

1280
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,120
creates an outsize effect
on the rate of plasticity.

1281
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,410
It accelerates plasticity.

1282
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,127
Now, some of you might be
asking, and I get asked a lot,

1283
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:18,520
"Well, how do I get
dopamine to be released?

1284
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,380
And can I just tell myself
that something is good

1285
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,213
when it's bad?"

1286
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:23,730
Well, actually yes, believe it or not.

1287
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,230
The thing about dopamine
is it's highly subjective.

1288
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,520
What's funny to one person

1289
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,800
is not necessarily funny to the next.

1290
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,940
So it has to have some sense
of authenticity for you.

1291
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,750
But if you really want to be learning

1292
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,500
the thing that you're trying to learn,

1293
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,847
that should be reason
enough to tell yourself,

1294
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:40,760
"Well, I'm frustrated,

1295
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,600
but the frustration is the
source of accelerated learning."

1296
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,570
Dopamine is one of these
incredible molecules

1297
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,240
that both can be released

1298
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,780
according to things
that are hardwired in us

1299
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,690
to release dopamine.

1300
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,310
Again, things like food,
sex, warmth when we're cold,

1301
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,250
cool environments when we're too warm.

1302
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,080
It's that kind of
pleasure molecule overall.

1303
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,270
But it's also highly subjective

1304
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:10,160
what releases dopamine in
one person versus the next.

1305
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,280
Everyone releases dopamine in
response to those very basic

1306
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,410
kind of behaviors and activities,

1307
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:18,380
but dopamine is also released

1308
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,440
according to what we subjectively
believe is good for us.

1309
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,980
And that's what's so powerful about it.

1310
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,540
In fact, a book that I highly recommend,

1311
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,080
if you want to read more about dopamine,

1312
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,850
is a book that frankly
I wish I had written,

1313
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:28,830
it's such a wonderful book,

1314
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,520
it's called "The Molecule of More."

1315
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,470
And it really talks about dopamine

1316
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,400
not just as a molecule
associated with reward,

1317
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,150
but a molecule associated
with motivation and pursuit,

1318
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,600
and just how subjectively
controlled dopamine can be.

1319
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,070
So make lots of errors,

1320
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,970
tell yourself that those
errors are important

1321
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,960
and good for your overall learning goals,

1322
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,620
so learn to attach dopamine,

1323
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,890
meaning release dopamine in your brain

1324
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,410
when you start to make errors,

1325
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,510
keep the bouts of
learning relatively short

1326
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,740
if you're an adult.

1327
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,080
Younger people can probably engage

1328
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,750
in more bouts of learning.

1329
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,520
And it's probably one of the reasons why

1330
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,240
they learn so much faster.

1331
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
They can just pack so
much more information

1332
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,640
into the brains and nervous
systems compared to adults.

1333
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,010
It's a little bit like,

1334
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,090
I'll use the example of
performance-enhancing drugs.

1335
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:18,610
Some of those drugs probably
do enhance performance

1336
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,530
at the level of increasing red
blood cell count, et cetera.

1337
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,520
But a lot of what those
drugs do is they allow

1338
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,340
athletes to recover faster
so they can just train more.

1339
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,010
They allow them to do more work.

1340
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,670
And so being a child is a little bit like

1341
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,660
being in a performance
enhanced brain milieu.

1342
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,010
Their brains are kind of on
natural, healthy neurochemicals

1343
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,700
that afford them a lot more
learning should they pursue it.

1344
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,570
So this goes back to my advice
for young people early on.

1345
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,440
If you're young, what should you do?

1346
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,580
Learn as much as you can

1347
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,370
about as many things as you possibly can.

1348
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,470
And I suggest specializing in something.

1349
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:56,350
I guess I'm not in a position
to give anyone direct advice,

1350
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:59,050
but I would say, hopefully,

1351
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,450
by about age 30, hopefully younger,

1352
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,200
you have some sense of what excites you

1353
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,240
and try and get really good at that thing,

1354
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,123
provided it serves the world for better.

1355
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,980
But that's all I'll say in
terms of parenting advice.

1356
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,220
It's not my place.

1357
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,890
But maybe sometime I'll have an episode

1358
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,190
completely devoted to sort of
youth and learning in youth.

1359
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,980
But once you're attaching dopamine

1360
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,570
to this process of making errors,

1361
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,360
then I start getting lots of questions

1362
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,040
that really are the right questions,

1363
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,080
which are, how often should I do this?

1364
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,190
And when should I be doing
this and at what time?

1365
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,490
Well, I've talked a little bit about this

1366
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,500
in previous episodes,

1367
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,920
but as long as we're now
kind of into the nitty-gritty

1368
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,680
of tools and application,

1369
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,250
each of us have some natural
times throughout the day

1370
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,700
when we are going to be much better

1371
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,780
at tolerating these errors

1372
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,520
and much more focused on what
it is that we're trying to do.

1373
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,490
Last episode was about focus,

1374
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,960
but chances are that you
can't focus as well at 4:00 pm

1375
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,170
as you can at 10:00 am.

1376
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,020
It differs for everybody
depending on when you're sleeping

1377
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,370
and your kind of natural
chemistry and rhythms.

1378
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,430
But find the time or times of day

1379
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,000
when you naturally have
the highest mental acuity,

1380
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,760
and that's really when you want to engage

1381
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,380
in these learning bouts.

1382
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,640
And then get to the point
where you're making errors

1383
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,710
and then keep making
errors for 7 to 30 minutes.

1384
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,350
Just keep making those
errors and drill through it.

1385
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,580
And you're almost seeking frustration.

1386
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,590
And if you can find some
pleasure in the frustration,

1387
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,300
yes, that is a state that exists,

1388
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,360
you have created the
optimal neurochemical milieu

1389
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,610
for learning that thing.

1390
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,320
But then here's the beauty of it,

1391
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,840
you also have created the optimal milieu

1392
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,760
for learning other things afterward.

1393
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,350
If you leave that about of,

1394
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,800
I gave the example of free throws,

1395
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,950
or maybe it's playing tennis,

1396
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,823
or maybe it's some other skill,

1397
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,360
and you sit down to read a book,

1398
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,890
your brain is in a heightened state

1399
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,500
to learn and retain the information.

1400
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,620
Because those chemicals don't get released

1401
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,610
and then shut down.

1402
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,060
You're creating a whole milieu,

1403
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,470
an environment of these chemicals.

1404
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:05,170
And the tale of how long
these chemicals stay

1405
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,220
sloshing around in your brain

1406
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,680
has too many factors for me
to put a hard number on it.

1407
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,880
It's going to depend on
transporters and enzymes

1408
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,240
and all sorts of things.

1409
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,350
But at least for an
hour or so I would say,

1410
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,400
you're going to be in a
state of heightened learning,

1411
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,060
and the ability to learn,

1412
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,910
not just the motor patterns
but cognitive information,

1413
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,010
language information,

1414
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,020
maybe you go to therapy right after that

1415
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,290
and you work on something

1416
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,650
in a very deliberate way that
you're trying to work on,

1417
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,090
maybe you don't go to therapy,

1418
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,410
maybe you do something else
that's important to you.

1419
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,990
Again, there are just a variety
of examples I could give.

1420
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,950
There are a number of things that

1421
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:44,200
allow us to powerfully
access these states of error

1422
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,633
that are kind of surprising
but also kind of fun.

1423
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,820
Again, these aren't gimmicks,

1424
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:53,010
these tap into these basic
mechanisms of plasticity.

1425
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:57,080
And the three that I'd
like to talk about next

1426
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,500
are balance,

1427
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,300
meaning the vestibular system,

1428
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,680
as well as the two sides

1429
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,460
of what I call limbic
friction or autonomic arousal.

1430
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,680
And if none of that makes sense,

1431
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,720
I'm going to put a fine
point on each one of those

1432
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,790
and what it is and why it works

1433
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,930
for opening up neuroplasticity.

1434
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,190
Let's talk about limbic friction.

1435
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,970
Now, limbic friction is not a term

1436
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,620
you're going to find in the textbooks.

1437
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,570
So if any of my colleagues are listening,

1438
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,890
I want to repeat limbic friction,

1439
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,010
I realize is not something
you're going to find

1440
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:29,650
in any of the textbooks.

1441
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,340
But it is an important principle

1442
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,290
that captures a lot of
information that is in textbooks,

1443
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,330
both neurobiology and psychology,

1444
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,263
and it has some really
important implications.

1445
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,710
Limbic friction is my attempt
to give a name to something

1446
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:50,460
that is more nuanced and
mechanistic than stress.

1447
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,950
Because, typically, when
we hear about stress,

1448
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,930
we think of heart rate,
heartbeat going too fast,

1449
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,450
breathing too fast, sweating,

1450
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,110
and not being in a state that we want,

1451
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,670
we're to alert and we
want to be more calm.

1452
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,050
And, indeed, that's one condition in which

1453
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,730
we have limbic friction,

1454
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,720
meaning our limbic system

1455
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,730
is taking control of a
number of different aspects

1456
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:15,180
of our autonomic or automatic biology.

1457
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,770
And we are struggling to control that

1458
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,260
through what we call top-down mechanisms.

1459
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,800
We're trying to calm down

1460
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,000
in order to reduce that level of arousal.

1461
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,030
We're all familiar with this,

1462
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,620
it's called the stress response.

1463
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,430
However, there's another aspect of stress

1464
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,290
that's just as important,

1465
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,950
which is when we're
tired and we're fatigued

1466
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,630
and we need to engage,

1467
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,750
we need to be more alert than we are.

1468
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,430
And so what I call
limbic friction is really

1469
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,100
designed to describe
the fact that when our

1470
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,330
autonomic nervous system
isn't where we want it,

1471
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,380
meaning we're trying to be more alert

1472
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,210
or we're trying to be less alert,

1473
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:51,980
both of those feel stressful to people.

1474
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,760
The other way to put it
is that the word stress

1475
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,480
is not a very good word to describe

1476
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,190
what most people experience as stressful

1477
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,240
because it can either be being
too tired or being too alert.

1478
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,650
Now, why am I bringing this up

1479
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,070
in a discussion about neuroplasticity?

1480
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,610
This is not a discussion about stress.

1481
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,310
At some point, we will talk about stress

1482
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,670
and tools to deal with stress.

1483
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,840
But the reason I'm
bringing this up is that

1484
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,330
in order to access neuroplasticity,

1485
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,620
you need these components of focus,

1486
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:21,610
you need the component of
attaching subjective reward,

1487
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,420
you need to make errors, all this stuff.

1488
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,810
And a lot of people find it difficult

1489
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:30,260
to just get into the overall
state to access those things.

1490
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,890
So now there's a series of gates

1491
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,320
that people are having
a hard time accessing.

1492
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,000
They're too tired and they
can't focus, for instance.

1493
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,970
Well, here's the beauty of it.

1494
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:44,470
If you are too alert,
meaning you're too anxious,

1495
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:47,430
and you want to calm down
in order to learn better,

1496
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,060
there are things that you can do.

1497
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,630
The two that I've spoken about previously

1498
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:52,680
on various podcasts,

1499
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,140
and I'll just review them really quickly,

1500
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,730
are the double inhale exhale.

1501
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,100
So inhaling twice through the nose

1502
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,610
and exhaling once through the mouth.

1503
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:02,240
This is not some yoga trick or some hack.

1504
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,110
This is what's called
a physiological sigh.

1505
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,350
It offloads carbon dioxide from the lungs,

1506
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:07,750
it has a number of different effects.

1507
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,153
These were described in
textbooks dating back to the 30s

1508
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,770
and a number of laboratories have explored

1509
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:16,610
the neurocircuitry underlying these

1510
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:18,140
so-called physiological sighs.

1511
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,150
That will calm you down
faster than anything else

1512
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,970
that I'm aware of.

1513
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:25,090
The other thing is starting
to remove your tunnel vision.

1514
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,150
When you use tunnel vision,
you're very focused,

1515
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,950
that epinephrine up is
released by dilating

1516
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,150
your field of gaze,
so-called panoramic vision.

1517
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,270
Great, so now you can start to

1518
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:39,200
sort of move up and down this
level of autonomic arousal.

1519
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,670
The key is you want to
be in a state of arousal

1520
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:43,730
that's ideally matched

1521
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,510
to the thing that you're
trying to perform or learn.

1522
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,140
So if I'm really anxious

1523
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,000
and I can't even pick up the basketball

1524
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,300
or I feel like I'm shaking
or my muscles are too tight,

1525
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,780
I don't have that kind of looseness,

1526
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,730
when I move like that, it
almost makes it look like

1527
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:59,403
I could throw a free throw,
but I miss 95% of the time,

1528
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,210
unless the basket is very, very low

1529
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,110
and I place it in directly.

1530
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,120
I guess that's not a free
throw, is it? [laughs]

1531
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,420
In any case, the point being that

1532
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:12,410
you want to be in a state
of alertness but calm.

1533
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,393
And so you need to have
ways to calm yourself down

1534
01:03:14,393 --> 01:03:16,423
when you're too amped up.

1535
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,570
But the other side of limbic
friction is important too.

1536
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,640
If you are too tired and you can't focus,

1537
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,370
well, then it's going to be
impossible to even get to

1538
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:26,880
the starting line, so to speak,

1539
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,740
for engaging in neuroplasticity

1540
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,550
through incremental learning, et cetera.

1541
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,070
So in that case, there are other methods

1542
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,210
that you can do to wake yourself up.

1543
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,060
The best thing you should do
is get a good night's sleep,

1544
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,220
but that's not always possible,

1545
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,900
or use a NSDR, non-sleep
deep rest protocol.

1546
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,400
But if you've already done those things

1547
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,200
or you're simply exhausted
for whatever other reason,

1548
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,580
then there are other things
that I often get asked about,

1549
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,550
like sure a cup of coffee or
super oxygenation breathing,

1550
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,530
which means inhaling more than exhaling

1551
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,453
on average in a breathing about.

1552
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,220
Now we're sort of getting
toward the realm of like

1553
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,360
how you could trick your
nervous system into waking up.

1554
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,960
And if you bring more oxygen in

1555
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,560
by making your inhales deeper and longer,

1556
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,220
you will become more alert.

1557
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,280
You'll start to actually
deploy norepinephrine

1558
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,700
if you breathe very fast.

1559
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,570
So there are things that you
can do to move up or down

1560
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,610
this so-called autonomic arousal arc.

1561
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,020
And what you want to
ask before you undergo

1562
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,770
any learning about is

1563
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,120
how much limbic friction
am I experiencing?

1564
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,820
Am I too alert and I want to be calmer,

1565
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:28,010
or am I too calm and too sleepy
and I want to be more alert?

1566
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:30,990
You're going to need
to engage in behaviors

1567
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,963
that bring you to the starting
line in order to learn.

1568
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:38,360
There are other things that
you can do in order to then

1569
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,820
learn better and faster
besides incremental learning,

1570
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,860
and those center on the vestibular system.

1571
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,870
And this may come as a
surprise to some people,

1572
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,010
but probably not as a surprise

1573
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:52,040
to some of you whose
professions or whose recreation

1574
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,420
involves a lot of motor activity

1575
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,810
and sort of what we call high
dimensional skill activity,

1576
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,360
not just running or cycling

1577
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,340
or very linear activities
like weightlifting,

1578
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,010
but things that involve inversions

1579
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,680
and a lot of lateral movement,

1580
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,690
actual sports, jumping, diving, rolling,

1581
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,670
these kinds of things,
gymnastics type stuff.

1582
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:13,370
Why the vestibular system
to access neuroplasticity?

1583
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:16,860
Well, we have a hardwired
system for balance,

1584
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,990
and here's how it works

1585
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,853
in as simple terms as I
can possibly come up with.

1586
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,140
As we move through space,

1587
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,780
or even if we're stationary,

1588
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,950
there are really three
main planes of movement.

1589
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,610
Now, I realize some people
are just listening to this,

1590
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,200
so I'm going to do this for both the folks

1591
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,120
that are just listening

1592
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,230
and for those of you that
are watching on video.

1593
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:39,130
So there are three main modes of movement.

1594
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,660
And it turns out that your brain

1595
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,350
doesn't really know where your body is,

1596
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,130
except through that
proprioceptive feedback.

1597
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,000
The main way it knows

1598
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,400
is through three planes of
movement that we call pitch,

1599
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,890
which is like nodding.

1600
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:54,780
So if I nod like this, that's pitch.

1601
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,450
Then there's yaw, which is side to side,

1602
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,640
which is like shaking my head no.

1603
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,690
And then there's roll from side to side

1604
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:04,330
like when a puppy looks
at you, like mm-mmm,

1605
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,680
that kind of thing.

1606
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,520
So pitch, yaw, and roll.

1607
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,600
And the pilots out there

1608
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,650
will know exactly what I'm talking about.

1609
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:16,490
The brain knows the orientation
and position of your body

1610
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,140
relative to gravity,

1611
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,730
depending on whether or
not your brain in your head

1612
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:25,220
actually is engaging more
in pitch, yaw, or roll,

1613
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,200
or some combination because
if I lean down like so

1614
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,570
or like so, it's a combination
of pitch, yaw, and roll.

1615
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,020
You might say like,
"What is going on here?"

1616
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,960
Well, we have these little
things in our inner ear

1617
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,620
called the semicircular canals.

1618
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,700
Just like our eyes have
two main functions,

1619
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,450
one is to see objects in space

1620
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:43,830
and the other is to set
our circadian clocks

1621
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,120
through subconscious mechanisms,

1622
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,060
our ears have two main roles.

1623
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:51,170
One is to hear, to perceive sound waves

1624
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:54,180
or take in sound waves for
perception, so-called hearing,

1625
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,620
and the other is balance
or vestibular function.

1626
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,210
So sitting in our ears are
these semicircular canals,

1627
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:02,200
and they're these little tubes
where these little stones,

1628
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,520
they're actually little bits of calcium,

1629
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,480
roll back and forth like little marbles.

1630
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,490
When we roll this way, they
roll this way, when we pitch.

1631
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,550
When we go from side to side,

1632
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,900
there's some that sit flat like this

1633
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,270
and they go [makes swishing sound]

1634
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:14,170
like marbles inside of a hula hoop.

1635
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,970
And then we have roll,
there's some that are kind of

1636
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:19,670
at 45 degrees to those and
it's kind of pitchy on roll.

1637
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:20,740
Okay, great.

1638
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,300
That sends signals to the
rest of our brain and body

1639
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,080
that tell us how to compensate

1640
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,010
for shifts relative to gravity.

1641
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,340
And you say, "Okay,

1642
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,740
I thought we were talking
about plasticity."

1643
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,220
But this is where it
gets really, really cool.

1644
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,220
Errors in vestibular
motor sensory experience,

1645
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:40,880
meaning when we are off-balance

1646
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,850
and we have to compensate by
looking at, thinking about,

1647
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,480
or responding to the world differently

1648
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,130
cause an area of our brain
called the cerebellum,

1649
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,470
it actually means mini brain,

1650
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:53,010
it looks like a little mini brain

1651
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:56,390
like tucked below our cortex in the back,

1652
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:58,390
cause the cerebellum to signal

1653
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,460
some of these deeper brain centers

1654
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,760
that release dopamine,
norepinephrine, and acetylcholine.

1655
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,730
And that's because these circuits

1656
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:09,713
in the inner ear, et cetera,

1657
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,150
and the cerebellum,

1658
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:16,920
they were designed to
recalibrate our motor movements

1659
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,609
when our relationship to gravity changes.

1660
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,049
Something fundamental to survival.

1661
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,939
We can't afford to be
falling down all the time

1662
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:25,209
or missing things that we grab for,

1663
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:28,450
or running in the wrong direction

1664
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:29,979
when something is pursuing us.

1665
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:31,959
These are hardwired circuits that tap

1666
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,649
right into these chemical pathways.

1667
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:38,659
And those chemical pathways
are the gates to plasticity.

1668
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,840
So I really want to spell this out clearly

1669
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,319
'cause I've given a lot
of information today.

1670
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,152
The first thing is,

1671
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:47,080
how are you arriving
to the learning about?

1672
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,420
You need to make sure your level

1673
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,100
of autonomic arousal is correct.

1674
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,140
The ideal state is going to
be clear, calm, and focused,

1675
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:56,670
maybe a little bit more
on the arousal level,

1676
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,340
like heightened arousal.

1677
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,200
So understand limbic friction,

1678
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,470
understand that you can be too tired,

1679
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,960
in which case you're going to
need to get yourself more alert,

1680
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,500
or you can be too alert

1681
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,250
and you're going to need
to get yourself calmer.

1682
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,270
That gets you to the starting line.

1683
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,510
When you're at the starting line,

1684
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:13,960
then you're going to go
into a learning about,

1685
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,880
and that's when you want to
start making these errors.

1686
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,200
But what I'm saying is
there's a layer in between

1687
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,850
where if you are interested
in using motor patterns

1688
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:27,470
as a way to open up plasticity
for all kinds of learning,

1689
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:28,683
not just motor learning,

1690
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:34,797
disrupting your vestibular
motor relationship,

1691
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:37,889
and I'll tell you how
to do that in a moment,

1692
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:41,319
can deploy or release
neurochemicals in the brain

1693
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,509
that place you into a state

1694
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:47,029
that makes you much better at learning

1695
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:50,439
and makes making errors
much more pleasureful,

1696
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:52,239
you're much more willing to do that.

1697
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,357
Now, some of you are probably saying,

1698
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:54,530
"Flow state, flow state."

1699
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:57,140
Okay, I have friends
that work on flow states

1700
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,430
and who are involved in

1701
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,340
flow states and trying to
figure out what they are.

1702
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,790
I have great respect for those people.

1703
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,585
I want to tip my hat to them.

1704
01:10:05,585 --> 01:10:07,010
Very important work.

1705
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,010
But, again, flow is an expression

1706
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,950
of what you already know how to do.

1707
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:13,010
It's not how you learn,

1708
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,770
it's how you express what
you've already learned.

1709
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,190
I want to be really clear about that.

1710
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,010
It's been kind of presented
as this super state

1711
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:24,380
or highly desirable state
that we can all reach for.

1712
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,250
That's the wrong [indistinct] to reach for

1713
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,880
until you already know
how to do the things

1714
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,960
that I'm describing, in my opinion.

1715
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,080
So the vestibular system,

1716
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,090
if you can engage the vestibular system

1717
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,130
and create some errors
within the vestibular motor

1718
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,860
operations that you're carrying out,

1719
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,440
you create a neurochemical
state that then makes you

1720
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:46,890
very, very good at learning
very quickly regardless of age.

1721
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,120
So what would this look like?

1722
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,910
Does this mean just doing inversions?

1723
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,010
Does this mean doing yoga?

1724
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:52,843
Maybe.

1725
01:10:52,843 --> 01:10:56,763
Does this mean taking corners
faster on your road bike?

1726
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,750
Let's say you always swim
freestyle or breaststroke,

1727
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:05,750
does this mean swimming
backstroke or butterfly?

1728
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,310
It depends.

1729
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,500
It depends, however, on a very,

1730
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,340
very easy to understand
parameter, which is

1731
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,600
how regularly you perform
a particular motor behavior

1732
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,820
and how novel a behavior is.

1733
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,380
So the more novel that a behavior is

1734
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,920
in terms of your relationship to gravity,

1735
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,580
the more it will open up the
opportunity for plasticity.

1736
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,160
Have you ever seen somebody who just

1737
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,560
jumped out of a plane for the first time

1738
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,850
with a parachute? [laughs]

1739
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,050
I don't even want to think about what,

1740
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:36,830
if you've just seen somebody
who jumped out of a plane

1741
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,070
for the first time without a parachute,

1742
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,250
I just hope the plane was on the ground.

1743
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,130
But if you seen somebody after that,

1744
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:44,870
they are in this incredible
state because their

1745
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:47,430
body and brain are flooded
with all these neurochemicals

1746
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,080
because it's very novel to them.

1747
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,040
However, I've got friends
from communities that

1748
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,860
have done thousands upon thousands,

1749
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,480
maybe tens of thousands of jumps,

1750
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,330
and they're always alert and aware,

1751
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,370
but it becomes pretty regular for them.

1752
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,240
That's the point.

1753
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,200
And they're not in this
kind of buzzed out,

1754
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,113
excited state afterwards
because it's routine for them.

1755
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,050
The key is to bring novelty

1756
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,490
to the vestibular motor experience,

1757
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:15,193
the vestibular motor commands
that you're performing.

1758
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,940
How do you do that?

1759
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:20,700
Well, it's all about your
orientation relative to gravity.

1760
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,740
Now, I wouldn't want anyone
to place themselves at risk.

1761
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:26,470
So if you can't do handstands,
don't try and do them,

1762
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,850
freestanding and whatever.

1763
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,030
If you're good at handstands,

1764
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:32,120
guess how much plasticity doing
handstands for half an hour

1765
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,870
is going to create for you.

1766
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,330
Zero.

1767
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,163
Zero.

1768
01:12:36,163 --> 01:12:38,630
Your body is fully comfortable
walking on your hands.

1769
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,590
I see these people walking on your hands,

1770
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,170
being upside down, being inverted.

1771
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:43,670
Your Cirque du Soleil performers,

1772
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:44,820
they're very comfortable there,

1773
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,370
and there is zero
learning, zero plasticity

1774
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,000
because the failures and errors

1775
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,430
and the relationship to gravity

1776
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,890
are very typical for that individual.

1777
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:56,600
Now, what this means is

1778
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,690
that if we're going to use motor practices

1779
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:00,560
to open up plasticity for learning,

1780
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,210
not just those practices, but
maybe some cognitive skills

1781
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,640
or other things in the
period that follows,

1782
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,720
we need to create a sense of
novelty relative to gravity.

1783
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,440
And that means being
either in a new position

1784
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,370
or slightly unstable.

1785
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,050
Believe it or not,

1786
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:18,320
I don't want anyone injuring themselves,

1787
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,000
but the sensation of
falling or close to falling

1788
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,970
signals the cerebellum to
signal the deep brain centers

1789
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,820
that release these neurochemicals

1790
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,887
that something is very different

1791
01:13:27,887 --> 01:13:31,080
and we need to correct
this error very, very fast.

1792
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,350
Now, earlier, I was talking about

1793
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,630
high contingencies for learning,

1794
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,610
and you definitely don't want
to make it a kind of like

1795
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,953
either survive this or
die kind of experience.

1796
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:43,450
I confess, I occasionally look at these

1797
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,880
parkour videos on YouTube.

1798
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,320
Believe it or not, a lot
of those people have died,

1799
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,389
the ones that do these ridiculous things

1800
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:52,260
of hanging off of buildings and things.

1801
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,620
I am not suggesting you do that.

1802
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,930
Please don't do that.

1803
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,120
What I'm talking about is
finding safe ways to explore

1804
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,600
the sensory motor vestibular
space, as we call it,

1805
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,090
the relationship between those things.

1806
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,520
So that could be through yoga.

1807
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,650
If you're terrible at yoga,

1808
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,070
there's more opportunity for you to learn

1809
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:09,480
than somebody who's very
skilled at yoga, for instance,

1810
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,340
or gymnastics, or handstands,
or on your road bike.

1811
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:14,180
This is, unfortunately, what,

1812
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,070
I don't want to name
brands, but stationary bikes

1813
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:17,700
where they give you the visual experience

1814
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,650
of moving through space,

1815
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,780
but you're not actually
moving through physical space,

1816
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:23,500
there's no vestibular feedback.

1817
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,663
It's all visual.

1818
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,640
You're stationary on the bike.

1819
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,810
So unless you're hanging off
the bike in your living room

1820
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:32,060
like almost to the point
you're tipping the bike,

1821
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,800
you're not getting the actual vestibular

1822
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,350
motor sensory mismatch.

1823
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:38,720
That mismatch is the signal that deploys

1824
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,500
dopamine, epinephrin,
and these other things.

1825
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,910
I don't care how excited or
how much fun the ride was

1826
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:45,190
or how much music you're
playing that you love,

1827
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,700
it's not the same situation

1828
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:52,700
as being out of your normal relationship

1829
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,210
to the gravitational pull.

1830
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,350
So the first gate is to arrive at learning

1831
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:00,660
at the appropriate level
of autonomic arousal.

1832
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,300
Clear and focused is best,

1833
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,490
but don't obsess over being
right there, it's okay.

1834
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:07,720
If you're a little anxious
or a little bit tired,

1835
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,640
then you want to make errors.

1836
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,750
We talked about that,

1837
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,640
and this vestibular motor
sensory relationship

1838
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,550
is absolutely key

1839
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:18,870
if you want to get heightened
or accelerated plasticity.

1840
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:21,420
And we talked about another feature,

1841
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,420
which is setting a contingency.

1842
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,570
If there's a reason,

1843
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:27,230
an important reason for
you to actually learn,

1844
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:28,910
even if you're making failures,

1845
01:15:28,910 --> 01:15:30,700
the learning will be accelerated.

1846
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,090
So there's really four things
that you really need to do

1847
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:36,060
for plasticity as an adult.

1848
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,730
And I would say that these
also apply to young people.

1849
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,120
And there's an interesting

1850
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,100
kind of a thought
experiment there as well,

1851
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,860
which is if you look at children,

1852
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:49,890
they are moving a lot
in different dimensions.

1853
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,593
They are sometimes hanging from trees.

1854
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,250
My sports were always
things where I tended to get

1855
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:58,290
hurt a lot, fall a lot.

1856
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:00,160
So it's skateboarding for
me when I was younger,

1857
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,790
so a lot of falling and rolling

1858
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,070
and various things of that sort.

1859
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,780
But whatever sport the kids are playing,

1860
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,790
or even if they don't play a sport,

1861
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:11,080
they tend to move in a lot of different

1862
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,960
relationships to gravity,

1863
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,850
more dimensionality to their
movements I should say,

1864
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:16,683
than adults.

1865
01:16:16,683 --> 01:16:18,130
And one of the questions that's always

1866
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,850
kind of been in the back of my mind is,

1867
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,950
as we age we get less good at
engaging in neuroplasticity.

1868
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,660
Part of that is because

1869
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,531
as the brain ages there
are certain changes to

1870
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:29,960
the way that neurons are structured,

1871
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,970
their molecular components, et cetera.

1872
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:35,500
But it's kind of a self-amplifying,

1873
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,480
or I should say self-degenerating cycle

1874
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:46,720
where as we get older, we
tend to get more linear

1875
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,250
and more regular about
specific kinds of movements.

1876
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,430
So we'd get on the treadmill,
or we take the walk,

1877
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:53,620
or we just always go up
the same stairs, et cetera.

1878
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,540
And there's less opportunity, typically,

1879
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:00,330
for engaging these relationships
to the gravitational pull

1880
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:03,200
through the vestibular
motor sensory convergence

1881
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,090
that we talked about a moment ago.

1882
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,350
And so you sort of have
to wonder whether or not

1883
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:10,390
the lack of plasticity
or the reduced plasticity

1884
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:13,363
in older individuals, which includes me,

1885
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,760
would reflect the fact that

1886
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,820
those chemicals aren't
being deployed because

1887
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,780
we're not engaging in certain behaviors

1888
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:24,250
as opposed to we can't
engage in the behaviors

1889
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,070
because the chemicals
aren't being deployed.

1890
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:27,310
Now, I have a feeling it's both.

1891
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,270
These have a reciprocal relationship.

1892
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,150
And I certainly, again, I don't think

1893
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,010
it would be wise for
anyone who doesn't have

1894
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:36,230
the muscle stabilizing skills

1895
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,640
or the bone density, et cetera,

1896
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,210
to start doing inversions
and things of that sort.

1897
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:43,190
That's not what I'm talking about here.

1898
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,610
But it's interesting to think about

1899
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:46,650
the sorts of exercise that we engage in.

1900
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:48,440
We all know that getting
the heart rate elevated

1901
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,090
three to five times a week

1902
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:52,190
is really good for us for
cardiovascular health.

1903
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,830
I think there's a ton of
data to support that now.

1904
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,290
Some load-bearing exercise is important

1905
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:58,540
for increasing bone density

1906
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,860
and maintaining muscular strength

1907
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,020
and proprioceptive feedback.

1908
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,320
Because, I'm sure many of you know this,

1909
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,470
but resistance exercise actually trains

1910
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:09,180
the nerve to muscle connections

1911
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:11,680
as much as it does the muscles themselves.

1912
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,210
Something I talked about at
the beginning of the episode.

1913
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:18,310
But I think most of us
could stand to increase

1914
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:21,800
the degree to which we
engage this vestibular system

1915
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,910
in novel ways.

1916
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,380
And that can be done quite safely

1917
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,230
through a number of different mechanisms.

1918
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,960
I'm not a surfer, but people
who do that sort of thing

1919
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,450
are very familiar with
orienting their body differently

1920
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:34,640
according to the gravitational pull.

1921
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,080
They're lying down, then
they're standing up,

1922
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,870
then they're turning,
they're leaning their head.

1923
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:40,440
So, again, it's this
pitch, yaw, roll thing.

1924
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,680
And, again, if you're
very skilled at surfing,

1925
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,810
you're actually not going to

1926
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,530
open up plasticity just by surfing.

1927
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:49,740
It's in the learning of these
new relationships to gravity

1928
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:52,563
that the windows for
plasticity are enhanced.

1929
01:18:54,034 --> 01:18:56,510
I want to make sure that
I underscore the fact

1930
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:59,060
that this vestibular thing
that I've been describing

1931
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,440
is a way to really accentuate plasticity.

1932
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:06,270
It's tapping into an
inborn biological mechanism

1933
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:09,100
where the cerebellum has outputs
to these deep brain nuclei

1934
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,563
associated with dopamine,
acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.

1935
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,870
You don't want to endanger
yourself in the course of

1936
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:18,863
pursuing these activities, but
it is a powerful mechanism.

1937
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,130
That's kind of an amplifier on plasticity,

1938
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,470
as is high contingency.

1939
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:26,590
If you really need to
learn conversational French

1940
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:28,130
to save your relationship,

1941
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,870
the chances are you're going to learn it.

1942
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,660
There are limits, of course, to the extent

1943
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:35,890
to which one can accentuate
or accelerate plasticity.

1944
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:37,890
The ceiling on this is not infinite,

1945
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:40,060
although we don't know how high it goes.

1946
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,340
I think it's reasonable to say that

1947
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:42,787
if someone put a gun to my head and said,

1948
01:19:42,787 --> 01:19:46,020
"Learn conversational French
in the next 120 seconds,"

1949
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,900
that conversational French will be limited

1950
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,320
probably to just one word,

1951
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,680
probably the word oui
or something like that.

1952
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,430
Because I can't stuff in all
the knowledge all at once.

1953
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,820
I think that's the dream
of brain-machine interface,

1954
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,610
that one will be able to download a chip

1955
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:01,790
into their hippocampus or cortex,

1956
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,670
or some other brain structure
that would allow them

1957
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:06,100
to download conversational French.

1958
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,573
And someday we may get to that,

1959
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,080
that capability may come about.

1960
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,130
Right now, it does not exist,

1961
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:17,040
nor is there a specific pill
or chemical that will allow you

1962
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,520
to download more information more quickly.

1963
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,120
This is the issue around nootropics

1964
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,790
I've talked about before.

1965
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:26,740
There are things that can increase focus,

1966
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,700
mainly things that increase acetylcholine

1967
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,160
and transmission through
the nicotine system,

1968
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,420
things that can increase
dopamine, things like L-tyrosine.

1969
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,590
Again, I'm not recommending these.

1970
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:37,390
You need to heed the
warnings on those bottles,

1971
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,960
but they will increase
these neurochemicals.

1972
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,100
And there are, of course,

1973
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,260
things that will increase epinephrin,

1974
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,220
things like caffeine,

1975
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:47,240
or some people, because of
prescription, take Adderall.

1976
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,850
I'm, again, not suggesting
people take any of these things.

1977
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:53,380
In fact, today I focused
almost exclusively

1978
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:58,020
on behavioral tools and ways
of structuring learning bouts

1979
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,350
that will allow you to
access more plasticity

1980
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:01,710
regardless of age.

1981
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,740
And they center around things that

1982
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:06,960
I'm sure if you look around you you'll see

1983
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,460
evidence for, "Oh, incremental
learning is powerful,"

1984
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,000
or, "Oh, the vestibular system

1985
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
can open up opportunities for plasticity."

1986
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,827
I'm sure that the yogis
out there all saying,

1987
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:18,470
"Wait, this sounds exactly like yoga.

1988
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:20,370
We're supposed to push to an edge

1989
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:23,100
and do these inversions and
do all those sorts of things."

1990
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:23,970
Well, I want to be clear,

1991
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:25,590
I never said anyone should do inversions.

1992
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:29,210
I said that the vestibular
system is a valuable portal

1993
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:30,680
into some of these neurochemical states

1994
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,150
that favor plasticity.

1995
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:36,170
But not so seldom, I hear
from the yoga community,

1996
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,507
and they will say things like,

1997
01:21:37,507 --> 01:21:39,700
"Much of what you're saying
about how the brain works

1998
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,520
or neuroplasticity has
already been described

1999
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,306
or is embedded in yoga practices."

2000
01:21:44,306 --> 01:21:45,460
And I just want to be very clear,

2001
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,690
I have tremendous respect for

2002
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:49,720
the yoga community and the practices,

2003
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,090
I've done yoga from time to time,

2004
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,940
I find it challenging and valuable.

2005
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,930
I'm not a regular practitioner.

2006
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:58,020
But the problem with yoga

2007
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,880
is exactly the same problem with science,

2008
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,780
which is that yoga has a lot of practices

2009
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,330
for which there are very specific names,

2010
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:10,290
but no description

2011
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:13,180
or lending of understanding
about mechanism.

2012
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,857
And science has a lot
of mechanisms [laughs]

2013
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:17,810
and a lot of publications and papers

2014
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,230
for which there's very little,

2015
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:22,053
if not no description
of tools and practices.

2016
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:26,260
My goal in not just today

2017
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,680
but in many ways throughout
the course of the podcast

2018
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,120
is to bridge the gaps between
these various disciplines

2019
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,360
in ways that are grounded mainly

2020
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,830
to the fields of neuroscience
and some related fields.

2021
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:40,370
So, yes, it's true that I look at things

2022
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,940
mainly through the lens of science,

2023
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:45,190
but that's not to say that
it exhaustively explains

2024
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:47,170
everything about anything,

2025
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,220
nor is it to say that it's the only lens

2026
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,520
through which one could look at

2027
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,210
something like neuroplasticity.

2028
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:53,850
So I just want to acknowledge that

2029
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,240
I have great respect for all these

2030
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,820
different practices and communities.

2031
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:00,730
And I think that, indeed,
there are many cases in which

2032
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,110
different communities
and practices have been

2033
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:07,380
aimed at targeting the
same goals or outcomes.

2034
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,080
Science and neuroscience,

2035
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,270
through an understanding of mechanism,

2036
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:15,470
can allow all of us to gain
kind of common understanding

2037
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:16,860
about what those practices are

2038
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:19,050
and how to access things
like neuroplasticity,

2039
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:20,900
sleep, et cetera.

2040
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,530
And I do believe. as I've said
previously on this podcast,

2041
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,030
that understanding mechanism

2042
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:28,140
affords us a certain flexibility.

2043
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,080
And I don't mean physical flexibility.

2044
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,340
I mean a flexibility when we can't engage

2045
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:34,380
in a particular behavior,

2046
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:36,390
maybe we were injured or
maybe we're not in the right

2047
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:38,750
situation to do a particular practice,

2048
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,640
but by thinking about mechanism,

2049
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,060
we can adapt our circumstances.

2050
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,990
I talked about this with sleep.

2051
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:47,350
If you're rigidly attached to one protocol

2052
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,620
of always looking at sunlight
at one particular time

2053
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,000
in the morning and in the evening,

2054
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,010
that is not as valuable as
understanding the mechanisms

2055
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:55,520
of why you might look at

2056
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,840
sunlight at one particular
time versus another

2057
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,670
because that affords you a flexibility,

2058
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:00,680
allows you to adapt.

2059
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:04,300
And life is very dynamic and
we don't have control over

2060
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,610
all the external conditions all the time.

2061
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,400
And so understanding mechanism

2062
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,560
through the lens of neuroscience,

2063
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,540
I do believe, can be very powerful

2064
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,160
because, of course,
there are multiple ways

2065
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,280
to access dopamine,

2066
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,120
there are multiple ways
to adjust limbic friction.

2067
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,270
It's not just through respiration.

2068
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,940
Of course, there are many ways to do that.

2069
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:25,100
And so my overall goal
here in this episode

2070
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,490
and with this podcast

2071
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:29,730
is to give you some
understanding of the mechanisms

2072
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:32,140
and the insights into
the underlying biology

2073
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:33,990
that allow you to tailor

2074
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:38,110
what these kind of
foundational mechanisms are

2075
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:40,790
to suit your particular learning needs.

2076
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:44,030
So I really thank you for
your time and attention today.

2077
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:45,540
I've covered a lot of material.

2078
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:49,050
I very much encourage questions
in the comments section

2079
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,880
if you're looking at this on YouTube.

2080
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,750
And if you're not and
you're listening to it,

2081
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,120
on Apple or Spotify.

2082
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,820
Please feel free to visit us
over on the YouTube channel

2083
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,760
and put your questions
in the comments section.

2084
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,650
I do read them.

2085
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,830
This entire month is all
about neuroplasticity.

2086
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,210
There's a lot to cover,

2087
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:06,640
but I'm very excited to
delve deeper into this topic

2088
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,140
as it relates to your
particular interests.

2089
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,600
Many of you have graciously asked

2090
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,740
how you can help support the podcast.

2091
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:13,910
The best way you can do that

2092
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,010
is to subscribe to the YouTube channel,

2093
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,740
if you haven't done that already,

2094
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,700
as well as to place questions
in the comments section below,

2095
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,200
or comments if you'd
like to give us feedback.

2096
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:27,060
Also to subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify.

2097
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,780
And Apple allows you to
leave a five-star review,

2098
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:32,170
if you believe we deserve
a five-star review,

2099
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:35,070
as well as leave comments
about the podcast.

2100
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:38,000
In addition, if you
can suggest the podcast

2101
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,070
to your friends, to your family members,

2102
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:42,330
or anyone that you think
might be able to use

2103
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:43,700
and appreciate the information,

2104
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:45,520
that's a terrific way to support us.

2105
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,400
And, of course, check out our sponsors

2106
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,620
that we mentioned at the beginning.

2107
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,200
That's a terrific way
to support us as well.

2108
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,100
Several times throughout today's episode,

2109
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,820
as well as on previous
episodes of the podcast,

2110
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,730
I've talked about various supplements

2111
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:00,670
that can be useful for enhancing sleep,

2112
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:03,190
enhancing neuroplasticity, et cetera.

2113
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,260
And, again, I want to emphasize that

2114
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,190
I always think that behavioral practices

2115
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:08,780
are the place to start.

2116
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,410
I don't think supplements should ever be

2117
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:11,950
the first line of entry

2118
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,000
for people looking to
enhance these aspects

2119
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,380
of their nervous system and life.

2120
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,720
But for those of you that
are interested in supplements

2121
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,300
and the supplements that I take,

2122
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,620
I'm pleased to announce that
we partnered with Thorne,

2123
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:23,950
T-H-O-R-N-E.

2124
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:27,190
And Thorne makes supplements
that are, in my opinion,

2125
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:29,700
of the very highest stringency in terms of

2126
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,290
what's listed on the bottle

2127
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:32,980
is actually what you'll
find in the bottle,

2128
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,410
this is a serious issue for
the supplement industry,

2129
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:37,460
as well as just the overall quality

2130
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:40,000
of the materials they put
into their supplements.

2131
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,730
If you'd like to take a look
at the supplements that I take

2132
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,410
as well as explore any
of them for yourself,

2133
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:50,410
you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.

2134
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:51,920
And if you look there, you'll see

2135
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,960
a number of the different
supplements that I take.

2136
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,960
And if you decide to purchase any of them,

2137
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,640
you'll get 20% off your order.

2138
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,590
So that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman

2139
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:03,980
to see the supplements that I take

2140
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,570
and to explore if any of
them are right for you.

2141
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:09,210
In the next episode of this podcast,

2142
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:12,380
we're going to continue to
explore neuroplasticity.

2143
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:15,080
This, as you may recall, is
the way that we go about things

2144
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,460
here the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2145
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:18,450
which is to really drill deeply

2146
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:21,980
into a topic for three or
four, or even five episodes

2147
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:24,160
so that by the end of those episodes,

2148
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,730
all of you have a very firm
understanding of how to

2149
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:28,970
apply the principles of neurobiology

2150
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,900
to the specific practices

2151
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,330
and endeavors that are
most important to you.

2152
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:36,140
So I very much thank you
for your time and attention.

2153
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,040
I know it's a lot of information

2154
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,490
and it takes a bit of focus and attention,

2155
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:43,200
and certainly will trigger plasticity

2156
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,060
to learn all this information.

2157
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,520
I want to encourage
you and just remind you

2158
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,970
that you don't have to
grasp it all at once,

2159
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,630
that it is here archived

2160
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,470
and that if you want to
return to the information,

2161
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:54,930
it will still be here.

2162
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:57,270
And that I, most of all,

2163
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:59,400
really appreciate your
interest in science.

2164
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,300
Thank you so much.
